Video Description: America’s air war in the Middle East was advertised as the most precise campaign in history. But new investigative reporting is revealing a cacophony of errors. Flawed intelligence and imprecise targeting caused the deaths of thousands of civilians, a number that was severely underreported by the Pentagon. Azmat Khan exposes the true human toll of American airstrikes for the New York Times Magazine and joins Hari Sreenivasan to discuss the impact of this warfare.

# “Thousands of Civilian Deaths” — NYT Investigates U.S. Airstrikes  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88)
*  Now, America's air wars in the Middle East, they were advertised as the most precise campaigns [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=0.0s)]
*  in history, but new investigative reporting is revealing a cacophony of terrible errors. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  Flawed intelligence and imprecise targeting caused the deaths of thousands of civilians, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=12.06s)]
*  a number that is severely under-reported by the Pentagon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=17.38s)]
*  Azmat Khan exposes the true human toll of U.S. airstrikes for the New York Times magazine, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  and she joins Hari Sreenivasan to discuss the impact of this warfare. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=26.84s)]
*  Christiane, thanks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=31.72s)]
*  Azmat Khan, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=32.72s)]
*  Now, there have been several different types of investigations looking at the collateral [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=35.2s)]
*  damage of airstrikes from the U.S. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=39.36s)]
*  What was different about yours? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=43.28s)]
*  What were you able to do that had not been done? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=44.72s)]
*  So in the past, when I've done reporting on the ground into airstrikes and I've taken [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=47.74s)]
*  to the U.S. military, they would often respond with the fact that they have classified intelligence [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=53.04s)]
*  that showed that there was a threat. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=59.04s)]
*  And once you meet that response, you're generally at a standstill, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=61.16s)]
*  There is evidence you can't refute because you can't see it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=65.52s)]
*  So several years ago, I started filing requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  documents that actually detail the intelligence behind these airstrikes that either resulted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=74.32s)]
*  in civilian casualties or the military rejected them as claims of civilian casualties. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=80.76s)]
*  And it took several years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=86.76s)]
*  But after filing a lawsuit against the Pentagon, I obtained more than one thousand three hundred [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=89.76s)]
*  of these kinds of records, records that tell you what they believed the threat was, what [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=96.28s)]
*  they were targeting, the process that they went through before conducting that airstrike, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=102.28s)]
*  and then their own evaluation of whether or not that civilian casualty claim was credible. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=107.16s)]
*  And I now had the means to compare what the military truly believed and whether or not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=112.4s)]
*  that was actually the case on the ground. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=118.64s)]
*  Now, the on the ground part, you were able to get on the ground with your reporting team [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=121.32s)]
*  and talk to survivors, witnesses of these airstrikes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=126.92s)]
*  I went to every single strike in this sample myself. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=132.28s)]
*  And what I did was I would take the coordinate the military claimed was associated with that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=135.4s)]
*  particular credible civilian casualty incident. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=142.48s)]
*  So of the three hundred and forty credible incidents, the coalition has acknowledged [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=145.84s)]
*  I went to the sites of 60 of those in Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=151.16s)]
*  Most of them were in Mosul, some were in other cities. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=155.4s)]
*  And what I would do is I would take the coordinate, the alleged coordinate and verify that the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  airstrike in that document took place there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=163.16s)]
*  Often this was done through associating it with the alleged target or figuring out details [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  where the video that was described in the document of what they had witnessed, whether [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=172.72s)]
*  that matched with what people were telling me on the ground. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  And then once I'd identified people who certainly were survivors of these incidents or had lost [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=180.16s)]
*  loved ones in these incidents or had been eyewitnesses, I would do in-depth interviews [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=185.88s)]
*  with them to try to reconstruct not just what was happening around that time of that strike [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=190.56s)]
*  and what things may have been misinterpreted, but to understand what the true toll of civilian [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=195.96s)]
*  loss was, I would document death certificates, hospital records, videos or photos of any [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=201.16s)]
*  injuries, the kinds of experiences that people have had as a result of these airstrikes that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=207.72s)]
*  I don't think we have a true picture of yet. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=214.56s)]
*  What's also powerful about this reporting is how you personalize it, how you go and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=217.24s)]
*  speak to families and you share that with your readers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=222.84s)]
*  I want you to tell us a little bit about the family that you met in East Mosul, the story [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=225.52s)]
*  of Qusay Saad. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=229.72s)]
*  So Qusay Saad was, you know, he had been forced to move from his home as the battle for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=230.84s)]
*  liberation began in East Mosul. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  And he and his family moved into a home in a neighborhood called Fasiliya. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=240.72s)]
*  And, you know, as the battle intensified, they could hear bombings all around. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=245.6s)]
*  The gate was ripped off the house they were staying in. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  He and his wife huddled together with their children and ISIS came to the house they [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=255.04s)]
*  were in and forced them to move into a house next door where other families were staying. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  And they basically were in different rooms and spent the night there as this battle [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=266.32s)]
*  intensified, hoping to just wait out until liberation occurred and their neighborhood [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=273.12s)]
*  was freed and they could leave. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=277.68s)]
*  Unfortunately, that morning, you know, Qusay Saad, as they were sitting down to breakfast, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=280.24s)]
*  he, his wife and their children essentially were met with an airstrike on their home. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=285.2s)]
*  And as he tried to free his child and his daughter, his son and his daughter and hand [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=290.88s)]
*  one of his children to his wife, the second strike occurred, leveling the entire building. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=296.8s)]
*  Qusay managed to get out with one of his sons, but he was unable to recover the bodies of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=302.64s)]
*  his wife or other children for two months. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=309.2s)]
*  In fact, when they found them, you know, they were, they were in a really grisly state. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=313.44s)]
*  That's, I think, hard to still talk about, but this is a man who now his, you know, his [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=318.24s)]
*  family says that he spends entire nights at the graveyard where his wife and children are [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=323.6s)]
*  buried, who's left his home, you know, before he was forced to move out of it or fled it, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=328.32s)]
*  you know, as it was before everything happened and he lost these family members. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  And he's, he's the person who told me, you know, what happened was not the liberation [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=338.88s)]
*  of Mosul. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=343.04s)]
*  It was the destruction of humanity and told me he wanted to see the video, the video [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=343.6s)]
*  that said that they saw, you know, ISIS fighters firing from that building or within [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=348.16s)]
*  that building. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=354.32000000000005s)]
*  And he said they should show me the video and I'll show them Mosul. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=355.44s)]
*  They need to see it with their own eyes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  What does the military say were civilian casualties and what did you find on the ground? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=361.68s)]
*  So in case after case, if the casualty was not reported via a journalist on the ground [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=369.92s)]
*  or via an NGO that went on the ground, the military tended to underestimate the casualties. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  They tended to count only what they saw in footage and footage was often lacking. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=381.44s)]
*  So sometimes it would be a minute and 22 seconds long. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=387.52s)]
*  And based on a review of that footage, because they saw no one being taken out of the rubble [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=391.12s)]
*  or because they saw they didn't see, you know, dead bodies in that footage that was sometimes [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=396.0s)]
*  just seconds long, they would sometimes reject these casualty allegations. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=402.4s)]
*  I went to dozens of non-credible sites in addition to those 60 credible sites. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=406.96s)]
*  And what I found even in instances where the military acknowledged casualties, where they [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=412.0s)]
*  had said, okay, we saw one child injured, you know, in that home, I might document a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  total of 12 people killed and multiple other injuries. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=421.76s)]
*  And this happened again and again. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=425.2s)]
*  So the system they're using, not just to acknowledge whether or not civilian loss happened, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=427.28s)]
*  but the true toll was severely underestimated. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=432.56s)]
*  I also found that there were different categories for why these strikes were occurring [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=435.84s)]
*  and that several of them were ones that the military seemed not to really know the full [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=440.88s)]
*  extent of. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think the most important one they were unaware of was what's known as [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=446.08s)]
*  misidentification. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=450.4s)]
*  So when they've concluded that somebody is a combatant, but in reality, that was a civilian [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=451.76s)]
*  and why those kinds of mistakes or misinterpretations happened. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=457.67999999999995s)]
*  And from that, as I dug deeper, I would find instances when they, for example, identified [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=461.76s)]
*  something as a weapons making factory that was in fact a cotton gin, where they associated [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=467.36s)]
*  what were white bags of what they saw as ammonium nitrate were probably just bags of cotton, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  where they looked at five men on motorcycles driving in the quote, signature of a threat [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=479.52s)]
*  from ISIS were in fact just men on motorbikes. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=485.12s)]
*  Things like this happened again and again, where something as simple as a civilian home [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=489.44s)]
*  was assessed to be an ISIS headquarters. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  And almost everything that people did was seen with an incriminating lens, something [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  that we often refer to as confirmation bias. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  So they were assuming that places were ISIS bases or safe houses, when perhaps they were [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  just normal residences. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=510.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=512.88s)]
*  One of the phrases that we hear in this is collateral damage or proportionality, that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=514.48s)]
*  there are likely to be civilian casualties, but that the US military is trying to balance [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=520.4s)]
*  the greater good that if they see a bomb making facility by ISIS, and unfortunately, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=526.16s)]
*  there's a child involved in the airstrike, this is a cost of war. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=531.36s)]
*  But in your reporting, you say that documents that the government has identified children [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=536.88s)]
*  killed or injured in 27% of cases in the Times is ground reporting, it was 62%. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=543.36s)]
*  What accounted for such an enormous disparity? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=551.44s)]
*  So part of is that they don't see children, right? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=555.6s)]
*  In some of these bombings, it takes a while to pull bodies. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=558.88s)]
*  Children can be very small, and the video footage isn't always very clear, depending [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=563.36s)]
*  on different factors. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=568.16s)]
*  But more than that, what I've often found is that their assessments of proportionality, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=569.76s)]
*  even in cases where they acknowledge that they saw children before a strike, sometimes, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=574.48s)]
*  rather than using that information to reassess whether or not they have the right target, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=580.56s)]
*  they proceeded with the strike anyway, saying that because they believed they were attacking [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=585.6s)]
*  a weapons factory, that the deaths of three children they spotted on a roof would be worth [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=590.16s)]
*  taking out that weapons factory. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=596.56s)]
*  And yet, when I went to that site, and I talked to everyone I could in that neighborhood, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=598.24s)]
*  what I found was that that was just an ordinary civilian home, a home where 12 members of a [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=603.12s)]
*  family lived and 11 of them were killed. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  Only one little girl survived. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  And when I talked to that little girl's grandmother, who was not at the house that night of the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=615.04s)]
*  strike, and I laid out what I'd seen in the document, and she told me that children would [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=620.24s)]
*  go on the roof of this house to warm up, that no one was ever making weapons at this [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=625.6s)]
*  facility. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  In fact, there was a bread oven on the roof, and it's possible that that bread oven was [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=631.36s)]
*  what they'd misinterpreted. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=635.76s)]
*  Maybe lots of smoke or a high heat signature from it was what made them determine this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=636.96s)]
*  was a weapons factory. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=641.6s)]
*  But when I told her that they assessed this to be proportional for this reason, her response [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=643.2s)]
*  to me was that they didn't gain any military advantage. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  The only thing they did is that they killed the children. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=651.44s)]
*  And so these assessments of proportionality, you know, what gives us faith, what gives [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=654.8s)]
*  the American people faith in our wars, is this idea that we conduct these airstrikes, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=659.3599999999999s)]
*  not just with a coherent process, but that our intelligence is really good. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  And what I found is that it's not just in quick instances of the fog of war where things [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=670.16s)]
*  are very quickly executed, even in cases where there are, there's a deliberate long-term [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=676.16s)]
*  pre-planned process. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=682.16s)]
*  The intelligence was wrong over and over. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=683.76s)]
*  And so it really calls into question what we've been told about how our wars are operated. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=686.96s)]
*  You know, I know that there are cases where the Pentagon compensates families. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=691.84s)]
*  How rare is that? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=696.16s)]
*  It's extremely rare. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=698.16s)]
*  Within Iraq and Syria, they've been made, they've probably been fewer than a dozen [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=700.24s)]
*  payments. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, when they're not on the ground to investigate these or to meet survivors [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=705.12s)]
*  themselves or to assess these kinds of claims themselves, they're also less likely [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=709.36s)]
*  to make those kinds of payments. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=713.68s)]
*  You know, this is something that in the past they saw as a strategic imperative, but it's [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  also important to keep in mind that these payments are capped at very low amounts, usually [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=720.0s)]
*  around $2,500 for a death. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=724.4s)]
*  So for some people, it's not nearly enough for losing a loved one. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=727.92s)]
*  And for those who have lifelong injuries, it's not nearly enough to have the kind of [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=732.4799999999999s)]
*  medical care they're going to need for the rest of their lives. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=738.24s)]
*  When you were speaking to some of the people on the ground in these different communities, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=742.0s)]
*  what does it do to your worldview, I guess, if you know that a missile can just literally [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=749.8399999999999s)]
*  come out of nowhere and you or your loved ones could be killed? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=759.92s)]
*  So I think it's caused a lot of the people I've spoken to to lose faith in their government. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=765.52s)]
*  Or in some of the systems that were responsible for the kinds of violence they faced. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=771.52s)]
*  And it really depends on which war zone you're in. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=778.4s)]
*  In Afghanistan, you know, I've met survivors who have told me that, you know, this was a [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=781.92s)]
*  large reason that many of these districts and areas fell to the Taliban or became Taliban [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  strongholds in recent years. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=794.4s)]
*  It's certainly the case that their perspectives on the Afghan government were radically shaped [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=796.56s)]
*  by the large number of civilian casualties that resulted not just from airstrikes, but [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=803.68s)]
*  different kinds of missions by Afghan forces, Afghan security forces. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  But also in Iraq and Syria, I've spoken to people who've basically said that we don't [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  call it liberation. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=819.8399999999999s)]
*  We call it the destruction of humanity or the eradication of ISIS was paid for with [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=820.9599999999999s)]
*  our bodies. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=826.16s)]
*  And they have a great deal of resentment towards their government for having left them [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=827.28s)]
*  with ISIS and cutting off all of the different exit corridors in Mosul that would have prevented [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=832.16s)]
*  them from having a lower rate of civilian loss. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=837.68s)]
*  Has the Pentagon responded to your work or their most recent reporting? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=841.76s)]
*  So when I went to the Pentagon to tell them about my findings, you know, they were adamant [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=845.8399999999999s)]
*  that they take great care to prevent civilian harm, that they regret each loss of civilian [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=850.24s)]
*  life, and that in instances where they've determined it's credible that they investigate [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=857.2s)]
*  each claim. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=861.44s)]
*  I haven't found that to be the case that they investigate each claim. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=862.96s)]
*  Investigation would require a full investigation, something they rarely conducted. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=866.64s)]
*  And I think it would also require them going on the ground, something that they don't do. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=871.6800000000001s)]
*  In terms of, you know, when I asked them, you know, would you or what has prevented you [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=876.96s)]
*  from going on the ground, they've talked about this environmental situation that is quite [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=881.12s)]
*  difficult and hard for them to operate within. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=885.84s)]
*  But me as a lowly reporter with a fraction of the resources or capabilities that they [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=888.6400000000001s)]
*  have, you know, was able to do this, then there's really no excuse for why they're not. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=896.08s)]
*  I can hear members of the US military saying, listen, this forever war has cost us more [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=901.84s)]
*  than 6,000 US service members. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=907.12s)]
*  And if we did not have the capacity to take airstrikes remotely, that number would be [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  much higher. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=916.08s)]
*  What do you say to that after looking through all these documents? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=916.8s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  And it's something I've written myself, right? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=922.0s)]
*  It's a choice that was made, you know, to reduce the number of American lives lost. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  I think the problem is that to truly measure whether the wars that are continuing should [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=931.36s)]
*  continue, you need an informed public that understands where those costs really lie. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=937.28s)]
*  And even if they're not happening in as high numbers to the American people, you do need [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=942.64s)]
*  to also consider these foreign lives that we don't fully know the true toll of or the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=947.6s)]
*  impact they're having on the ground. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=952.88s)]
*  You know, for example, these parts of Afghanistan that became Taliban strongholds, right? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=954.56s)]
*  Things that the members of the public should know. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=960.32s)]
*  It was really startling to me to see how many people were so surprised by the fall of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=963.6s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=969.28s)]
*  But to those who've been watching not just civilian casualties, but the outcomes of these [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=970.8s)]
*  wars from reporters who told it on the ground, from these people who've experienced it there, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=975.52s)]
*  it wouldn't be a surprise. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=981.76s)]
*  And so what I would say is that I would not let the fact that there are reduced casualties [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=983.2s)]
*  for American service personnel to distract from the fact that there are still casualties [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=988.64s)]
*  happening and they're having significant impacts on the ground. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=995.6s)]
*  And we need that information to truly understand not just whether the costs and means of war [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=998.64s)]
*  are worth it, but to have that in mind the next time the American public is set to debate [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=1004.4s)]
*  another war. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=1010.08s)]
*  Investigative reporter for the New York Times Magazine, Azmat Khan. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=1011.92s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=1014.64s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Hari. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p3gNrxog88&t=1015.92s)]
