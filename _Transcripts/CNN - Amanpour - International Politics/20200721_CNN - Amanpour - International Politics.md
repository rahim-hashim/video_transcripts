Video Description: On Monday the UK suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and banned the export of any riot control equipment to the territory. The reason for this about-face from one of the Westâ€™s most China-friendly nations is a new national security law imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing that criminalizes most political dissent in the territory that once belonged to Britain. Activist Nathan Law responds.

Originally aired on July 20, 2020.

# UK Suspends Extradition Treaty With Hong Kong  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [July 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4)
*  First, your reaction to what just happened today with the UK announcing suspending extradition [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=0.0s)]
*  and also no longer sending or suspending sales of that equipment to the region. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think the Foreign Secretary made that decision very promptly. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Two weeks ago, I issued an open letter urging this country to end the extradition treaty [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=18.92s)]
*  to Hong Kong because under the national security law, Hong Kong does not enjoy rule of law. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=23.8s)]
*  And there are several countries committed to it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=29.12s)]
*  And I'm glad that today the Foreign Secretary announced that policy change. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  I think in the long term future, there will be more and more assertive policy from the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=36.68s)]
*  UK government to China and Hong Kong. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=41.24s)]
*  Let me just ask you, I know you're a very young man. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=43.88s)]
*  I think you're 27 years old. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=48.0s)]
*  And we've just been talking about the great democracy activist, John Lewis, who put his [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=50.28s)]
*  life on the line for all those years. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=54.36s)]
*  You guys have done something similar in Hong Kong for several seasons now in terms of democracy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=57.44s)]
*  protests. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=63.68s)]
*  You've been met by heavily militarized police. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  There's been a lot of scuffling. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=67.2s)]
*  How do you put your battle for freedom and human rights in, I guess, the civil rights [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=69.12s)]
*  and the greater global battle for freedom? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=74.96s)]
*  Yeah, I honestly dare not to compare myself to John Lewis because he's been really a figurehead [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=78.52s)]
*  of the whole movement and he's legendary. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  And while from his record, he's been arrested for like 40 something times during his whole [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=89.63999999999999s)]
*  resistance movement. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=95.88s)]
*  And he's been committed to it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=98.52s)]
*  And he's a enlightening figure to a lot of our generations, a rep about him. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=99.96s)]
*  So this is such an honorable figurehead for me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  So I think it's important that we have someone to learn from. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=110.32s)]
*  And it's important that that spirit could be a momentum force for a lot of younger generations [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=114.32s)]
*  who stood that fight for justice. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBKg7-cJ_4&t=120.63999999999999s)]
