*  And we turn now to another woman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=0.0s)]
*  who wears a lot of hats, so to speak. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=2.0s)]
*  Former U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=4.8s)]
*  has been an activist, a journalist, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=6.8s)]
*  an author, and a policymaker. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=8.5s)]
*  Her first book on genocide, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=10.5s)]

*  The Education of an Idealist. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=29.0s)]
*  Samantha, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=33.5s)]
*  Thank you, Walter. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=35.8s)]
*  This is an extraordinarily personal, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=36.8s)]
*  intimate memoir. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=39.5s)]
*  And it really begins with your relationship [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=41.5s)]
*  with your father and sort of growing up [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=43.5s)]
*  reading mystery stories in a pub in Ireland [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=45.5s)]
*  when you were a kid. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=48.5s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=50.0s)]
*  So the pub in Dublin was called Hardigan's. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=51.0s)]
*  It still exists. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=53.5s)]
*  It's a bit grimy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=55.0s)]
*  It's probably not the place I would want [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=57.0s)]
*  my children to be hanging out reading mysteries. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=59.5s)]
*  But there's something at least in my memory [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=63.0s)]
*  that's quite magical about my father [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=66.0s)]
*  who died subsequently when I was 14 years old, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=69.0s)]
*  so who I don't have as many memories [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=72.0s)]
*  as I would like to have with. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=75.0s)]
*  But he would bring me to the pub. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=77.0s)]
*  He would park me next to him. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=79.0s)]
*  He was such a regular of this pub [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=81.0s)]
*  and unfortunately was such a big drinker [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=83.0s)]
*  that the seat at the bar was called [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=85.0s)]
*  the seat of power for Jim Power, my dad. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=87.0s)]
*  And I would sit next to him [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=90.0s)]
*  and then I would go down into the basement [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=91.0s)]
*  and I would just while the hours away [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=93.0s)]
*  reading my books and coming up [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=94.5s)]
*  when I was done with one looking for another, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=96.0s)]
*  he'd run out to the car, get me another one. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=98.0s)]
*  And again, no environment for a child. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=100.0s)]
*  But when you're a child, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=104.0s)]
*  the fact that you can capture your father's attention [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=106.0s)]
*  when you need it, you know, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=109.0s)]
*  can end up being the only measure of the man. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=111.0s)]
*  That's how I felt at the time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=114.0s)]
*  I certainly didn't feel at that time [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=116.0s)]
*  like I had a difficult childhood. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=118.0s)]
*  But my mother and my father separated [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=120.0s)]
*  and there was no divorce in Ireland back then. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=124.0s)]
*  So the options for her, she had met somebody else, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=126.0s)]
*  also an Irishman from Dublin, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=129.0s)]
*  and they wanted to build a life together. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=131.0s)]
*  So they decided to make their move to this country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=134.0s)]
*  But it ended up in tragedy [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=137.0s)]
*  because after we came to America [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=139.0s)]
*  really before I got to spend more meaningful time with my dad, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=142.0s)]
*  my father died to me very suddenly. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=145.0s)]
*  And you talk so much about the anxieties [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=148.0s)]
*  that came out of that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=151.0s)]
*  That seems very useful to readers to know too [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=152.0s)]
*  that people like yourself can be deeply anxious [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=155.0s)]
*  because you had to in some ways choose [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=159.0s)]
*  to move when you were in America [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=161.0s)]
*  between your mother and your father [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=163.0s)]
*  and then his drinking happened. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=165.0s)]
*  And then you deal with it the rest of your life. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=167.0s)]
*  You deal with it and you don't even know what you're carrying. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=170.0s)]
*  I think for me it was years later [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=172.0s)]
*  before it really started to unpack [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=175.0s)]
*  just the sense of responsibility I felt [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=177.0s)]
*  as often is the case with children [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=180.0s)]
*  who grow up to be adults and look back. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=183.0s)]
*  They exaggerate, they impose their adult selves [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=185.0s)]
*  on their child selves [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=188.0s)]
*  and think that when they were children [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=190.0s)]
*  they had the power and the agency [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=192.0s)]
*  that they have when they're looking back. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=194.0s)]
*  So unpacking all of that was really important. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=196.0s)]
*  But yes, I was, again, whether because of these events [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=198.0s)]
*  or for other reasons, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=202.0s)]
*  but I found myself at different times in my life [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=203.0s)]
*  actually usually when I was in unstressful environments [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=206.0s)]
*  with just horrific kind of constricted breathing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=210.0s)]
*  And it was often the case that I was, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=215.0s)]
*  you know, could free myself of these feelings [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=219.0s)]
*  only when I was, for example, a war correspondent [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=222.0s)]
*  or when I was operating under a deadline [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=225.0s)]
*  or even later in life [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=228.0s)]
*  when I was in a very high stakes negotiation [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=230.0s)]
*  whereas when things were still, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=232.0s)]
*  whatever lay within would sort of come bubbling up. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=235.0s)]
*  And so I write about trying with therapists [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=238.0s)]
*  to understand that a little bit. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=241.0s)]
*  And sometimes you feel very alone [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=243.0s)]
*  when you're going through episodes like that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=245.0s)]
*  or you're feeling, I mean, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=248.0s)]
*  and people have many more significant challenges [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=250.0s)]
*  than I have faced. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=253.0s)]
*  But whether it's that or writing about our efforts [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=254.0s)]
*  to conceive a child and infertility and IVF [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=257.0s)]
*  and all of that, it's just sort of like this is life. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=260.0s)]
*  This is what it looks like. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=263.0s)]
*  It doesn't look like the veneer, you know, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=264.0s)]
*  of all these polished people running around. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=267.0s)]
*  There's a great saying that I come back to in the book, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=269.0s)]
*  which is never compare your insides [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=271.0s)]
*  to somebody else's outsides. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=273.0s)]
*  And I feel like there's something deep in that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=275.0s)]
*  But part of the, you know, open up the insides [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=278.0s)]
*  and then let people know out there that, you know, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=280.0s)]
*  everybody has their struggles. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=283.0s)]
*  Tell me about getting to know Obama. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=285.0s)]
*  Well, it came about because he read [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=288.0s)]
*  a problem from the book on American responses to genocide. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=292.0s)]
*  And I was surprised. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=296.0s)]
*  He was the only senator who reached out to me, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=298.0s)]
*  had reached out to me at that point at least, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=300.0s)]
*  having read the book. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=302.0s)]
*  And I thought maybe he'd want to talk about the book [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=304.0s)]
*  in its narrow sense. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=306.0s)]
*  Focusing specifically on mass atrocities [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=308.0s)]
*  and what could be done on this or that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=310.0s)]
*  But in fact, he was really interested, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=312.0s)]
*  it was a very creative read or kind of broader read, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=314.0s)]
*  in sort of what that set of responses indicated [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=318.0s)]
*  about the tendency of the U.S. government [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=323.0s)]
*  not to think about human consequences more broadly [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=326.0s)]
*  on a whole set of issues. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=330.0s)]
*  And he was new to the Senate [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=331.0s)]
*  on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=333.0s)]
*  And wanting to put forth already what he called [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=335.0s)]
*  a tough, smart and humane approach to foreign policy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=339.0s)]
*  So you become a foreign policy advisor [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=343.0s)]
*  to his during the campaign. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=345.0s)]
*  And you get to know Cass Sunstein, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=347.0s)]
*  who becomes your husband. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=349.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=350.0s)]
*  So it's all rolled into one. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=351.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, that one, that was a bit of a miracle. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=352.0s)]
*  That's more serendipity because I was sitting [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=354.0s)]
*  at my desk one day and Cass, I received a letter, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=357.0s)]
*  excuse me, an email from the Senate [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=361.0s)]
*  and the email basically was an email lambasting [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=363.0s)]
*  the state of the campaign or at least one subset [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=370.0s)]
*  of the campaign that worked on Obama's rule of law ideas. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=372.0s)]
*  And it's a blast email. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=376.0s)]
*  He didn't mean to blast out, right? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=378.0s)]
*  He was trying to send it to one person. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=380.0s)]
*  And so he does that great email mistake. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=381.0s)]
*  Yeah, completely. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=383.0s)]
*  I'm thinking, did he just send to that one person [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=384.0s)]
*  because it was addressed to one person. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=386.0s)]
*  And he sent it to me. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=388.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm sorry, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=389.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=391.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=392.0s)]
*  And then because it was addressed to one person, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=393.0s)]
*  am I the only one? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=394.0s)]
*  And then very soon I realized it had gone [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=395.0s)]
*  to the entire Obama campaign. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=396.0s)]
*  And that made you decide you wanted to marry him. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=398.0s)]
*  I just thought, poor guy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=400.0s)]
*  I mean, what else is he going to do? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=402.0s)]
*  Nobody else is going to marry him. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=403.0s)]
*  No, I thought to myself, I've done that and it sucks. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=404.0s)]
*  My heart, I just went out to Cass Sunstein [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=409.0s)]
*  and so I wrote him, I said, just don't worry about it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=413.0s)]
*  And next time you're in Boston, let's get a coffee. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=416.0s)]
*  I promise you people will forget. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=419.0s)]
*  And next thing I knew, we were married. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=421.0s)]
*  Well, he had to walk you through your big mistake. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=423.0s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=427.0s)]
*  Which is on book tour, you make the mistake [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=428.0s)]
*  of offhandedly using the word monster [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=430.0s)]
*  when you're talking about Hillary Clinton. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=433.0s)]
*  Not my finest hour. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=435.0s)]
*  And so you have to step down from the campaign for a while. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=436.0s)]
*  You're in the penalty box. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=439.0s)]
*  The Sin Bin, as my Irish relatives called it, indeed. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=441.0s)]
*  It was my first campaign. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=444.0s)]
*  I was so emotionally invested. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=446.0s)]
*  I did not have a kind of distance [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=449.0s)]
*  or the experience of prior campaigns. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=451.0s)]
*  So what were probably in retrospect pretty traditional, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=453.0s)]
*  maybe not ideal campaign tactics, but a bit run of the mill, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=459.0s)]
*  for me were just these transgressions, these outrace. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=463.0s)]
*  And so basically I went off and was all upset about something [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=467.0s)]
*  that the Clinton campaign was doing. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=471.0s)]
*  And then a reporter published it, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=474.0s)]
*  and it included the denigrating comments about Senator Clinton. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=477.0s)]
*  And it was mortifying. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=481.0s)]
*  For the first time really since the community of reporters [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=483.0s)]
*  I've been with in Bosnia, I was on this amazing team. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=486.0s)]
*  And the next thing, poof, it was gone. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=489.0s)]
*  And I had just started dating Cass at the time. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=492.0s)]
*  And my impulse was to push him away [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=495.0s)]
*  and to go through this period of where I was very embarrassed [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=498.0s)]
*  and ashamed as to what had happened, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=503.0s)]
*  but to go through it on my own. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=505.0s)]
*  And he just wouldn't let me. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=507.0s)]
*  And he just was like, nope, I'm not going anywhere. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=509.0s)]
*  And your mentor, Richard Holbrooke, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=511.0s)]
*  decides to give you a wedding gift. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=513.0s)]
*  He decided, you know, he was one of the great negotiators [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=515.0s)]
*  in American foreign policy history, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=519.0s)]
*  and he decided to put those skills to use [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=521.0s)]
*  and went to Senator Clinton after Barack Obama had secured [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=523.0s)]
*  the Democratic nomination. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=528.0s)]
*  And he said, I would like to broker a meeting [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=530.0s)]
*  between Samantha, who stepped down from the campaign [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=534.0s)]
*  for the things she said about you, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=538.0s)]
*  and you, would you indulge that? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=540.0s)]
*  And she was great. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=543.0s)]
*  The real hitting of reality that happens to you is Syria. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=545.0s)]
*  Explain why you were so adamant that America needed to do something [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=550.0s)]
*  when Assad uses those chemical weapons. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=555.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, technically, everyone in the world was adamant [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=558.0s)]
*  that someone needed to do something. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=562.0s)]
*  I mean, it was the largest chemical weapons attack in 25 years. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=565.0s)]
*  The challenging question was, what was the thing that needed to be done? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=569.0s)]
*  And what was the tool that could be employed at manageable risk or cost [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=574.0s)]
*  that would bring about the benefits that you sought, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=582.0s)]
*  which is no more chemical weapons attacks [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=584.0s)]
*  of that monstrous nature? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=586.0s)]
*  And what I described in the book was what many remember, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=589.0s)]
*  which was global revulsion over what had occurred, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=592.0s)]
*  a very swift response on the part of President Obama, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=596.0s)]
*  and basically a resolve to punish the chemical weapons attack [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=601.0s)]
*  with limited military airstrikes, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=606.0s)]
*  followed by a tasking to me to go and get UN weapons inspectors out of Syria, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=609.0s)]
*  not to go physically to Syria, but to go to the secretary general [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=617.0s)]
*  and to get him to pull those inspectors out, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=620.0s)]
*  because they were there to answer a question that didn't need to be resolved, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=623.0s)]
*  which was not who did it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=627.0s)]
*  That would have been a very useful question to resolve, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=630.0s)]
*  because Russia and other countries were claiming it wasn't the Syrian regime. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=632.0s)]
*  But they were only there with a mandate to discover [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=635.0s)]
*  whether or not chemical weapons had been used, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=638.0s)]
*  and everybody knew they had been used, Russia, Iran, the Syrian government. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=640.0s)]
*  Nobody was denying it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=643.0s)]
*  The only relevant question was who had done it and what to do about it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=645.0s)]
*  And so the secretary general, for a set of reasons that I explained in the book, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=648.0s)]
*  said, they're there, we're going to fulfill the mandate. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=653.0s)]
*  And they stayed, and they gathered samples, and they talked to survivors, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=657.0s)]
*  and they established, of course, what everybody already knew, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=661.0s)]
*  which was that sarin had been used. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=663.0s)]
*  But over the course of that week where they didn't come home, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=665.0s)]
*  in the meantime, David Cameron went to his parliament [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=669.0s)]
*  and was afforded in his effort to get support to join the United States and France [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=672.0s)]
*  in this limited military action. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=677.0s)]
*  And President Obama himself began to hear from members of Congress who said, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=680.0s)]
*  come here, you shouldn't be going into a country like Syria. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=685.0s)]
*  This doesn't have anything to do with the military authorization [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=688.0s)]
*  that the president was given in the wake of 9-11. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=691.0s)]
*  You should seek a new authorization, or people criticizing him for other reasons. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=694.0s)]
*  But what ended up happening is in that week, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=701.0s)]
*  President Obama decided to change course not in his ultimate disposition. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=705.0s)]
*  He was still intent on using airstrikes again to try to disable dimensions of the program. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=710.0s)]
*  But he decided that in order to do so and in order to not take on the risk [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=716.0s)]
*  of this lasting a long time and Assad being able to, in effect, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=723.0s)]
*  wait the United States out, he decided to go to Congress. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=727.0s)]
*  But in your book, you say you ask him the very important question when he surprises you. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=730.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was actually surprised. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=736.0s)]
*  He says, OK, I drew the red line, but I'm not going to do the attack until I get congressional approval. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=738.0s)]
*  And you say... [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=742.0s)]
*  What happens if you don't get the votes? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=744.0s)]
*  And I had just gone through Senate confirmation. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=747.0s)]
*  And so as I write in the book, every fiber in my being was thinking, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=750.0s)]
*  it doesn't really feel like it's on the level up there. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=755.0s)]
*  It's not the case really that the very Republicans who've been calling on you to use force [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=758.0s)]
*  and denouncing what they call your fecklessness, that they're going to turn around and now embrace what you do. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=764.0s)]
*  They seem to want to do the opposite of whatever you want to do on a given day. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=771.0s)]
*  And there is also the great exhaustion and disillusionment and despair over how the war in Iraq went. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=775.0s)]
*  And Democrats especially and progressives are very disturbed by that [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=784.0s)]
*  and very concerned about something that might lead us to be entangled. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=789.0s)]
*  So I had the sense of, I'm not sure among Republicans or Democrats, is there a quorum here for this? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=793.0s)]
*  But again, his logic was one dimension, his logic was very sound, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=799.0s)]
*  which was you are stronger as America in the world when you have domestic backing. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=804.0s)]
*  And you are weaker when you're out there kind of alone without the ballast of a constituency behind you. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=811.0s)]
*  So what ends up happening, as I write, is we very quickly realize that there is no meaningful constituency [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=821.0s)]
*  for the approach that the president has already publicly committed himself to. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=830.0s)]
*  Republicans who had been for the use of force on a Monday, as soon as Obama was for it, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=835.0s)]
*  flipped and opposed it and Democrats were very sorry. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=841.0s)]
*  But surely he knew that that was a risk. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=847.0s)]
*  He must have known that Congress was not going to give him the authorization. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=850.0s)]
*  Even you said it at the meeting. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=854.0s)]
*  You know, there is a lot of revisionism because the president was elected to get the United States, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=857.0s)]
*  in part to get the United States out of wars and drew down our presence in Iraq [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=866.0s)]
*  and substantially reduced it to the levels really roughly that they're at now in Afghanistan [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=870.0s)]
*  and has a skepticism about, certainly about, war in the Middle East and all the ways it can go wrong. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=877.0s)]
*  I think people believe that this was like a ploy on his part, that he went to Congress in order to fail. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=886.0s)]
*  As I write in the book, he went to Congress thinking he was going to succeed. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=892.0s)]
*  It seems very naive in retrospect and it was clearly a mistake. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=897.0s)]
*  I mean, it was a mistake. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=900.0s)]
*  It was a mistake to go to Congress? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=902.0s)]
*  Well, it was a mistake in the sense that the votes weren't there and we were publicly committed to a course of action. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=904.0s)]
*  That then to take that course of action in defiance of congressional will was impossible. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=910.0s)]
*  So in a sense, the president's hands were tied by the procedural pathway that we took. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=918.0s)]
*  But in the end, and I credit President Obama for his improvisation here, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=924.0s)]
*  he went to President Putin and said, hey, what you know, and kind of, I think, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=929.0s)]
*  bluffed a bit about the prospects for being able to secure congressional authorization or perhaps the willingness to go ahead even in the, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=936.0s)]
*  because he always said that his commander in chief authority gave him license to go. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=944.0s)]
*  I mean, he reserved that. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=948.0s)]
*  Would he have gone ahead? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=949.0s)]
*  No. I don't think so, but. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=950.0s)]
*  And was that a mistake? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=952.0s)]
*  Again, I think to I think it was very reasonable when Putin said, yes, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=954.0s)]
*  I will work with you to take what Putin said at the time was all the chemical weapons away, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=961.0s)]
*  you know, to get them out of a madman's hands so that sarin strikes of that magnitude would not happen again. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=967.0s)]
*  That was hugely important. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=974.0s)]
*  But the cost of Congress's will being exposed or lack of will being exposed, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=976.0s)]
*  the cost of a kind of an impression globally that the president couldn't deliver domestically the support he needed for a foreign policy priority that he had said he had. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=983.0s)]
*  There was a cost to U.S. credibility that was profound. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=999.0s)]
*  And of course, the Syrian war itself rages on. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1002.0s)]
*  Wouldn't there have cost more to just our credibility, which is the entire refugee crisis that has now destabilized Europe? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1004.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that if you if you ask about what are the costs of the Syrian war, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1012.0s)]
*  I mean, five hundred thousand people killed this issue of America saying that it's going to do something and then not following through. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1017.0s)]
*  You can debate that. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1025.0s)]
*  And then the spillover into the neighboring countries, which ultimately in 2014, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1027.0s)]
*  fifteen led to this huge migration across the continent, which without which I'm not sure we'd have Brexit. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1033.0s)]
*  And I'm not sure even that immigration would have been so salient to allow someone like Trump to be elected in this country and all of the consequences of that. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1041.0s)]
*  But having said that, Walter, in fairness, because hindsight is twenty twenty, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1050.0s)]
*  I can't also say to you that had we taken limited military strikes in August, September of 2013, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1056.0s)]
*  that those limited actions would have averted all of those consequences. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1064.0s)]
*  Samantha, thank you so much. Thank you, Walter. Great to see you. Great to be with you. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1069.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwAdjLn2_M&t=1085.0s)]
