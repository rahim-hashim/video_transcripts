# Palestinian-Ukrainian Refugee Zoya Miari “Both Sides of Me Are Worth Living”  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ)
*  Now, as we know, the climate crisis isn't the only issue that drives migration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=0.0s)]
*  According to the UN, over 10 million refugees and asylum seekers were forced to flee their homes [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=4.64s)]
*  due to conflict in 2022. Being half Palestinian and half Ukrainian, our next guest has been [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=10.32s)]
*  displaced not once but twice, first leaving Lebanon in 2021 and then Ukraine when the war [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=16.96s)]
*  broke out two years ago. Now, Zoya El-Miyari is a peace ambassador for One Young World. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=23.2s)]
*  It's a charity that supports young leaders across the globe and she joins Hari Srinivasan to share [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=30.16s)]
*  her complex experience as a refugee. Christiane, thanks. Zoya El-Miyari, thanks so much for joining [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=35.44s)]
*  us. Zoya, thanks for being here. You are in an almost unique position of being a refugee twice [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  over. You are both Palestinian and Ukrainian. I guess for the audience, tell me a little bit [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=50.48s)]
*  about your backstory. Where did you grow up? Thank you for the introduction. My name is Zoya. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  I'm half Palestinian, half Ukrainian. My dad is Palestinian from Lebanon. My mom is Ukrainian. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=63.12s)]
*  I grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp, which is the largest refugee camp in Lebanon. These [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=70.16s)]
*  Palestinian camps were built after the Palestinians were forced to flee their homes [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=75.68s)]
*  back in Palestine in 1948. After that, the communities there kept on growing and growing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  I lived in this refugee camp, which was a community filled with child abuse, mental illnesses, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=89.04s)]
*  ongoing clashes until the age of 15. Later in 2021, when the situation in Lebanon was getting [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  worse and worse, we decided to move to Ukraine for a fresh start. Later in 2022, the war starts in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=101.36s)]
*  Ukraine and we had to escape the war for a second time in our lives and becoming refugees for a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=107.76s)]
*  second time. When you were growing up as a kid, I wonder, did you tell your friends in school that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=113.68s)]
*  you lived in a refugee camp, that that was part of your identity? I went into a very good school. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=119.36s)]
*  Unlike my siblings, they were going to honor schools, which were facing some kind of challenges. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=125.28s)]
*  With the good quality education that I got, the children there were coming from richer [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=134.32s)]
*  communities. In that situation, I was really scared because of the associated stereotypes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=141.76s)]
*  I remember when other students were worried about their grades, I was really scared that they would [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=148.24s)]
*  ask me, where do you come from? That they would discover my reality living in a refugee camp. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=152.8s)]
*  I was really scared to tell them that I live in a refugee camp or I was really ashamed about this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  reality. You had the option to go to a private school or a better school and there you weren't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=163.52s)]
*  that proud of your refugee status or identity. What happened when you were leaving Ukraine? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=169.28s)]
*  At that point, did that change? When the war started in Ukraine and we were escaping the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=176.24s)]
*  war for the second time, because back in 2006, the war between Lebanon and Israel, we were also [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=182.72s)]
*  forced to flee Lebanon to Ukraine because Ukraine always represented a safe space for us, a safe [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=189.2s)]
*  haven. Whenever something bad was happening in Lebanon, we would always go to Ukraine. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=195.04s)]
*  This time that the war was happening in Ukraine, we had to escape the war for the second time. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  I remember when we were in the train heading to Poland, my mom told me, Zoya, we should sing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=206.4s)]
*  We started singing Ukrainian folk songs and with each song, our resilience was growing stronger. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=212.16s)]
*  This time, I promised myself that if I make it out alive, I refuse to become the victim I once was, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=217.84s)]
*  but rather I would become a warrior and a fighter. I would fight for those in Ukraine and I would [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  fight for my Palestinian side, the side that as a kid I was afraid to fight for. I'm struggling to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=230.64s)]
*  figure out how these two identities that you're living influence your life. Ever since I was a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=237.6s)]
*  child, I always had this internal conflict because when the war happened in Lebanon and we escaped [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=244.64s)]
*  to Ukraine, my dad was only Palestinian and in Lebanon, we are considered stateless refugees. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=249.68s)]
*  My dad stayed in Lebanon and was not allowed to go with us to Ukraine. It created an internal [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=255.92s)]
*  conflict in me. Why would I be able to escape to a safer space when my dad stayed behind? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=264.48s)]
*  Now that the war happened in Ukraine and we escaped the war, suddenly I felt that the whole [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  world was welcoming the Ukrainians and we truly appreciate that, but that is something that really [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=276.8s)]
*  conflicts the other side of me. Here I felt these double standards of one half of me being [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=282.48s)]
*  completely humanized when the other side is completely dehumanized. It's really as if one [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=288.56s)]
*  paper, one document defines the way I would live, defines my life. Explain that to me. The Ukrainian [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=294.32s)]
*  side of you, you feel is humanized and the Palestinian side is dehumanized. Am I hearing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=301.44s)]
*  that correct? Yes, that's correct. I can talk about the language that is being associated with [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=305.28s)]
*  Ukrainian refugees, for example, and my other half being Palestinian. For example, growing up, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=311.52s)]
*  we always got used to Palestinians being portrayed as barbarians or terrorists. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=317.52s)]
*  On the other hand, now as Ukrainians, we were refugees, European refugees, who the world saw as [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=323.68s)]
*  part of them, part of those people. Often the language that is being used in Western media, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=332.64s)]
*  European media, always portrays the Palestinians as terrorists. In a way, that is how the genocide [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=340.4s)]
*  that's happening in Gaza right now, in a way people are not able to see that what's happening [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=347.92s)]
*  is terrible because of the media that has been portraying the Palestinians over and over again [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=353.36s)]
*  as barbarians or terrorists. That's the conflicting double standards that's happening when the media [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=358.96s)]
*  portrays the Palestinians one side of me in one way and the other side of me in another way. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=367.84s)]
*  It's very important to point out that both sides of me are worth living, whether I'm Palestinian [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  or Ukrainian or wherever I come from, I am worth of living. I deserve to live. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  We are not terrorists. We are actual human beings. Even as refugees, we are not just [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=386.23999999999995s)]
*  numbers or statistics to be portrayed on a screen or mainstreamed on the media. We are actual human [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=391.68s)]
*  beings. We are children who are full of dreams and aspirations. We are mothers and fathers [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=399.2s)]
*  who really love their children unconditionally. So no, we are not terrorists. We are human beings [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=404.8s)]
*  just like everyone else. You live in Switzerland now. How do you stay a family when parts of your [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=410.64s)]
*  family are here, parts of your family are there, and you know that they're both in lands where [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=418.96s)]
*  there is danger? This is a very sad reality and this is what refugees have to go through when [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=426.32s)]
*  the families are scattered all around the world because of the lack of safety and security. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  So there is some type of survival guilt, of course, because in a way we were saved, but also in Lebanon [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  the situation is very bad, in Ukraine as well. So it's always continuous worrying about what could [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=444.64s)]
*  happen here, what could happen there, also in West Bank, also in Gaza. So it's continuously really [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=450.24s)]
*  being in a survival mode, of course, and in a way that really also makes me question, like, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=456.64s)]
*  what is home to me? I grew up questioning myself, what is home to me? Because so many people, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=464.8s)]
*  if you ask them, ask them, like, what is home to you? They can really specify, like, that's my home, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=470.0s)]
*  that's my home. And to me, like, how can I say that Palestine is my home if I'm not even allowed to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=475.04s)]
*  visit my home country? Or how can I say Lebanon is my home if I grew up as a Palestinian refugee there? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=481.36s)]
*  Or in Ukraine now there is a war. So this also reminds me of the conversations I used to have [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=488.72s)]
*  with my grandfather who was forced to flee Palestine back in 1948, and he was sharing [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=494.0s)]
*  with me that at the time they thought that they were leaving their homes just for three days and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=499.6s)]
*  that they were going back home. And they left Palestine with their keys that they kept on [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=505.12s)]
*  holding for so long, wishing that they can only use them back home. And my grandfather died in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=509.84s)]
*  Lebanon, Palestinian refugee died in Lebanon with his only one dream, to use those keys and go back [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=515.92s)]
*  home buried with him. And this really makes me question, like, why some people from Brooklyn or [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=522.4s)]
*  Europe can come to Palestine and take the Israeli citizenship and enjoy their human rights when us [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=529.52s)]
*  as Palestinians who grew up outside of Palestine, around six million Palestinians outside of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=537.12s)]
*  Palestine, and we are not even allowed to go and visit our country, not only not go back to our home, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=543.28s)]
*  but not even visit. So my dad, who grew up in Lebanon, he has never visited his home country [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  in Palestine because he's not even allowed to go there and visit. What do you find are parallel [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=558.4s)]
*  between the conflicts in Ukraine and what's happening in Gaza right now? So there is occupation [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=564.32s)]
*  on both sides, and it's very important to notice that, and this is something I've been mentioning, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=571.28s)]
*  that we cannot fight for one part of me and not fight for the other because really there's no one [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=575.76s)]
*  is free until everyone on this earth is free, whether in Palestine and Ukraine, Sudan, Congo, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=581.84s)]
*  Yemen, everywhere. That is how true liberation, collective liberation is achieved. Also in Ukraine, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=588.16s)]
*  everyone knows the narrative. The whole world knows the narrative, knows the Russian propaganda, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=594.24s)]
*  knows the occupation now happening in Ukraine. And when it comes to the narrative, when we want [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=599.36s)]
*  to talk about Palestine and Israel, suddenly the language becomes very complicated and the whole [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=605.5200000000001s)]
*  situation becomes complicated when it's really clear that there is the oppressor and there are [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  the oppressed, there is the occupier, and there are those who are being occupied for decades long. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=616.96s)]
*  You're working as a peace ambassador now. What does that mean? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=623.6s)]
*  Yes, for so long I was questioning what peace means to me because as a child growing up in a [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=627.2s)]
*  refugee camp, honestly all what I wanted was peace. I did not understand in my community where [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=632.56s)]
*  I hated that community growing up, honestly. For so long I couldn't understand or comprehend [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=640.4799999999999s)]
*  why people there were so angry all the time or resort to violence as a way of expressing [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  themselves or their pain. Until I grew older and understood that those people, my people, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=651.52s)]
*  are actually oppressed. They were never taught ways to express themselves in a more healthier [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=656.64s)]
*  way. And that's where I felt that that need to become a peace ambassador, to teach people how [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=662.24s)]
*  they can express themselves in a way that their pain could actually be used as a peaceful weapon. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=668.72s)]
*  I became a peace ambassador after participating in One Young World Summit back in Manchester. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=674.8s)]
*  I was questioning myself what does peace mean to me after this situation, the genocide in Gaza [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=681.52s)]
*  started. And I came to realize that peace is something I value. That's one of my top values [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=687.2s)]
*  in life. But I also understood that with peace comes justice. If I'm fighting for peace, that [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=695.12s)]
*  means that I'm fighting for justice as well. Because when there is no justice, there is no peace. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=701.12s)]
*  So today that is what peace means to me. Peace means fighting against the occupation, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  ending the occupation. Only then we can achieve peace. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=712.56s)]
*  How do you deal with people who have a totally different point of view of the world and reality? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=716.8s)]
*  Right? Like there are Israelis wanting to ensure their safety and security. They feel like they're [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  living next to a government that has sponsored acts of violence and terror against them. So when [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  you as an ambassador of peace bump into people who have these worldviews that are so diametrically [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=735.28s)]
*  opposed to how you see things, how do you approach them? How do you communicate and how do you [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=741.76s)]
*  see them and hear them? That's a very good question. And maybe here I can share a little [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=747.6s)]
*  story that I had experienced. When we escaped the war in Ukraine, the first thing that I wanted to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  do was to go to Auschwitz camp because my grandfather used to tell me stories of Jews who were killed [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=760.4s)]
*  during the Holocaust. And I went to the Auschwitz camp just six days after the war in Ukraine [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=765.84s)]
*  started. And what I saw there really terrified me. I saw pictures of children hanging on the wall. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=771.52s)]
*  And I really wondered how did the world allow this to happen back then? What type of propaganda [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=779.36s)]
*  justified the killing of those children? And now I'm also asking myself what type of propaganda [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  is allowing people to be blind to an extent that the killing, the slaughtering, the murder [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=793.68s)]
*  of children today is somehow justified or the killing of over 30,000 souls is also somehow [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=799.3599999999999s)]
*  justified. And I remember reading there in Auschwitz a quote that says something like, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=805.92s)]
*  we need to know our history for it not to be repeated. And what's happening today in the world? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=812.2399999999999s)]
*  Where is humanity? Why is the history keeps on repeating itself? So I feel like today in our [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=816.96s)]
*  position as youth fighting against the occupation, against injustices in the world, what we want is [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=824.96s)]
*  the end of this cycle of violence once and for all and for everyone. So I remember talking to a Jewish [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=831.12s)]
*  person who also became my friend and she was sharing about those Jews who are fighting for [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  free Palestine to whom I have a huge respect. But we were also talking together because she [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=844.4s)]
*  has a different view of seeing things from maybe from the Israeli perspective, the Israeli propaganda. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=850.8s)]
*  And we were talking, it's important to talk, I was talking to her and I told her please send me [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=857.68s)]
*  everything that you are seeing. I need to understand the way that they are thinking. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=863.92s)]
*  And I was sending to her how I am seeing things and the reality I'm sharing with her the truth [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=870.0s)]
*  because we need to know the truth. It's time to acknowledge the truth for to stop it from being [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=874.9599999999999s)]
*  repeated once and for all. So that is one way to start the conversation by sharing that yes, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=881.12s)]
*  I was in Auschwitz. I respect those Jews who are fighting for free Palestine. But what I don't [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=888.24s)]
*  understand are the Zionists who are using the pain of the Jews as an explanation or justification [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=894.0s)]
*  for what they are doing today in Palestine, in Gaza, in West Bank, not only now but for the past [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=901.52s)]
*  75 years. So yes, everyone deserves to, everyone can live freely on that land and every land, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=907.76s)]
*  but not when it comes on an expense of other people, not at the expense of displacing thousands of [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=915.68s)]
*  Palestinians for so long. You've said before that I did not choose my struggles, but I get to choose [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=922.24s)]
*  how I perceive my own story. Explain that if you will. What I realized when I came to Switzerland, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=928.96s)]
*  I started sharing my story and in Lebanon, I did in a way, victimize myself by being ashamed for [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=936.4s)]
*  things I did not choose, for lying to my friends that I come from a refugee camp, for lying to my [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=944.24s)]
*  friends that I lived in a single room with my whole family for the first 15 years of my life. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=949.84s)]
*  So I was really ashamed. But when I started sharing my story, I realized that the way I tell [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=957.6s)]
*  my story to myself will have a direct impact on the way I will lead a life for myself. So today, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  I could see myself as a victim, but I choose to see myself as a warrior and a fighter. And this is [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=971.36s)]
*  what I want other refugees, displaced people, migrants to see that we should not hide behind [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=976.96s)]
*  our realities, but rather celebrate our resilience. We should no longer feel ashamed for things that [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=982.96s)]
*  we did not choose, but rather celebrate the power and the strength and the love that we still have [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=988.72s)]
*  within despite all the traumas, all the struggles. Zoya El-Mihary, a peace ambassador from One Young [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=994.32s)]
*  World, a Palestinian and Ukrainian refugee. Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=1001.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUzMARx1RQ&t=1005.2s)]
