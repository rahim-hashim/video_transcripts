Video Description: The reality of a second term for President-elect Donald Trump is sinking in across the globe. World leaders are flooding Trump with congratulations and trying to get his ear on issues from the Middle East to Ukraine, wide-ranging tariffs, and the climate. Trump's re-election is seen as a major blow to the effort to overcome the climate crisis. These topics will be on the docket at the G20 Summit in Brazil later this month, where host Brazilian President Lula da Silva will likely see parallels between Trump's return and his own country's history with far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro -- known as "the Trump of the tropics" -- whose supporters stormed government buildings after Bolsonaro lost out on a second term. Christiane spoke about the issues with President Lula da Silva.

# President of Brazil Offers his Thoughts on Donald Trump's Victory | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY)
*  What do you want to tell the American people and the world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=0.0s)]
*  since you've congratulated Donald Trump [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=2.7s)]
*  on his return to the White House? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  You said the world needs dialogue. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=7.84s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=9.94s)]
*  Well, what I mean with that is that the world cannot continue [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  to spend $2 trillion and $400 billion in arms race, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=16.04s)]
*  and we're having conflicts. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=22.28s)]
*  And we should spend this money to build illiteracy programs [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=23.88s)]
*  and to fuel millions and millions of people [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=27.96s)]
*  that are still starving, that are in hunger in the world. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=29.84s)]
*  So what we need is to learn how to take care of the poorest [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=33.08s)]
*  people so that they won't be poor anymore [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=36.16s)]
*  and that we can manage and build an economy for mass consumption [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=38.76s)]
*  because we don't have these mass consumers today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=43.72s)]
*  Less money with war and more money for peace, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=46.12s)]
*  this is the solution for the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=49.2s)]
*  That's why the G20 has as main motto [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=50.84s)]
*  on a global alliance against hunger and poverty. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=53.64s)]
*  This will be an important issue that will be discussed there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=57.86000000000001s)]
*  And then we have the energy transition [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=60.96s)]
*  and to confront climate changes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=64.64s)]
*  And then we have another issue that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=67.2s)]
*  is the UN reform and of the Bretton Woods institutions. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  And then we have something that is extremely important, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=71.78s)]
*  that is taxation of the super rich. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=73.98s)]
*  We have 3,000 people in the world [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=76.08000000000001s)]
*  that have a wealth that are cured of almost $3 trillion. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=77.54s)]
*  And while you have 733 million people that are still [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=82.72s)]
*  in hunger in the world, and at the same time, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=86.12s)]
*  we have already held 130 meetings, 22 working groups. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=89.48s)]
*  And for the very first time, we're [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  going to have a social G20 with the participation of civil [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=96.4s)]
*  society around the world. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=99.9s)]
*  And we also have an empowerment group for women at the G20. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=100.92s)]
*  So these are the novities that I wanted to convey to you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=104.4s)]
*  And I'm sure that we'll have a beautiful G20 summit meeting [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=107.0s)]
*  and we'll make important decisions [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=110.92s)]
*  to see if we can make the world better and more humanistic [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=112.86s)]
*  once again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=117.34s)]
*  OK, so you are having this meeting, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=118.02s)]
*  hosting it in Brazil later this month. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=119.94s)]
*  But I want to ask you then, do you [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=122.18s)]
*  think that Donald Trump as the next US president [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=124.02s)]
*  will do what you say to talk about taxation, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=126.98s)]
*  to make it more fair for people, to make it more fair for women? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=131.06s)]
*  I just want to note that the world's 10 richest people [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=134.54s)]
*  became $64 billion richer from Trump's re-election. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=139.7s)]
*  That's what Bloomberg is saying. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  What would you tell Donald Trump about your views [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=147.82s)]
*  on how to make a more equal world? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=150.78s)]
*  Well, first of all, I'm of the view [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=154.5s)]
*  that we have to say to President Trump is the following. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=156.06s)]
*  First, I think that we too, as head of states and government [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=159.22s)]
*  of two important countries in the Americas, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=163.26s)]
*  we have to have a very civilized relationship, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=165.66s)]
*  a democratic relationship, because Brazil [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=168.62s)]
*  has a privileged relationship with the US. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=170.5s)]
*  We are trade partners for many decades and many years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  And I believe that the stock of investment of the US in Brazil [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=176.42s)]
*  is tremendous. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  And so I believe the two heads of state, when they meet, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=182.5s)]
*  we have to talk about the interests of the US [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=185.18s)]
*  and the Brazil interests and what [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=187.7s)]
*  is important for the relationship of two heads [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  of state. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=193.18s)]
*  And I have a past track, because I [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=193.7s)]
*  had a very good, excellent relationship with George [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=195.42s)]
*  Bush when I took over in 2003. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=198.62s)]
*  They said to me, it's going to be difficult with Bush. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=200.78s)]
*  But it was an extraordinary relationship with Bush. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=203.1s)]
*  Also, I had a very good relationship with Obama. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=205.22s)]
*  And I have a very good relationship [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=207.58s)]
*  with President Biden. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=209.38s)]
*  And this relationship should continue, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=210.58s)]
*  because two heads of state, although they [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  could have divergence, political ideological divergence, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=214.54s)]
*  when they meet, what prevails is the interest of the state, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=217.18s)]
*  not personal interests. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=220.86s)]
*  And so what I want to discuss with the US [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=222.46s)]
*  is the interest, the 200-year-old relationship [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=224.42s)]
*  of Brazil and the US, what both countries have to do so [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=228.82s)]
*  that we can improve the quality of life of the people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=231.46s)]
*  that we represent. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzVRMqt4rY&t=234.78s)]
