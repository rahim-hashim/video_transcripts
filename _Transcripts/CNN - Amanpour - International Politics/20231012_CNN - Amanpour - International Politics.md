*  and implement change. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=18.96s)]
*  Christiane, thanks, Dr. Rajiv Shah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=21.22s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=22.62s)]
*  I know you're the head of the Rockefeller Foundation now, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=23.96s)]
*  and you have worked at the Gates Foundation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=26.96s)]
*  USAID and, you know, some of those experiences. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=29.779999999999998s)]
*  Before we get into this new book that you have called Big Bets, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=32.68s)]
*  I want to ask a couple of questions about the crisis [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=36.92s)]
*  that's unfolding in front of our eyes right now in Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=39.62s)]
*  And you have some experience dealing with the aftermath [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=42.96s)]
*  of disasters like Haiti and working in war-torn areas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=46.72s)]
*  And I wonder right now, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=51.22s)]
*  what would you be advising the U.S. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=53.5s)]
*  government when it comes to figuring out [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=55.9s)]
*  how we can help solve what is likely to be a humanitarian crisis? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=58.46s)]
*  Yeah, well, Hari, great to see you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=64.48s)]
*  And thank you for asking that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=66.0s)]
*  I think, you know, decades of experience [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=67.44s)]
*  working in conflict zones during conflicts [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=70.28s)]
*  teaches us that there's a very simple set of principles [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=73.42s)]
*  the U.S. government and the Israeli government [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=76.14s)]
*  should take into consideration. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=78.42s)]
*  I think first, we have to fully appreciate [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=79.72s)]
*  1,200 Israelis killed in an absolutely horrific terrorist attack [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=83.36s)]
*  should be condemned, called for what it is and warrants [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=87.82s)]
*  a strong, aggressive response to protect Israel [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=90.72s)]
*  and to allow Israel to protect itself, period. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=94.96s)]
*  Second, you know, as Israel and its allies, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  including the United States, approach this, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  we have to approach this with a 3-D approach, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  defense, diplomacy, and development in humanitarian affairs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  And on the defense side, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=111.34s)]
*  we're seeing already an aggressive response. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=112.5s)]
*  On the diplomatic side, intense diplomacy throughout the region [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=115.04s)]
*  is actually going to be critical to creating an environment [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=119.28s)]
*  where the region doesn't destabilize further, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=122.92s)]
*  as it has been prone to do in prior situations [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=126.22s)]
*  that are akin to this and inclusive of development. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=129.66s)]
*  You know, 63 percent of the Gaza population [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=133.08s)]
*  was food insecure prior to this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=136.52s)]
*  Almost a quarter of that population [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=138.8s)]
*  was getting humanitarian assistance from the United States and others. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=140.7s)]
*  And condoned by and supported by Israel prior to this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=144.94s)]
*  And, you know, if there's a massive humanitarian catastrophe, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=148.0s)]
*  as it looks like we will have, that will destabilize the region [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=151.48s)]
*  in a way that acts against Israeli national interest. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=155.78s)]
*  And frankly, losing the hearts and minds [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=159.58s)]
*  and the value proposition that Israel firmly has right now [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=162.28s)]
*  will further undermine Israeli national security [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=166.7s)]
*  in the medium and long term. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=169.5s)]
*  And what we've seen in so many different examples [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=171.2s)]
*  is a few specific considerations on the front end [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=173.78s)]
*  can help make sure that long term [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=176.88s)]
*  and middle term national security is more robust. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=179.86s)]
*  You know, one of the things that you say in your book [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=184.66s)]
*  to try to get people to open up kind of possibilities [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=186.82s)]
*  and creative ways of thinking is a question. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=190.26000000000002s)]
*  What would you do if you had a magic wand? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  And I wonder in conflict situations like this, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=195.16s)]
*  how do you even approach sides that really are just seeing red? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=199.06s)]
*  Yeah. Well, look, we've seen this in Afghanistan. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  We've seen this in Syria and Aleppo. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=207.14s)]
*  We've seen this in so many different settings. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=209.5s)]
*  And the truth is, there are tactics and approaches one can take [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=211.84s)]
*  to protect humanitarian priorities even during conflict. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=216.78s)]
*  And they can be baked into defense strategies [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=222.38s)]
*  and most importantly, baked into diplomatic strategies. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=224.88s)]
*  Israel has rightly suggested for the purpose of saving civilian lives [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=228.02s)]
*  that people in Gaza evacuate. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=234.22000000000003s)]
*  Now, evacuation, obviously, in that region is very, very, very difficult. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=236.96s)]
*  There's, you know, it requires active collaboration [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=241.82000000000002s)]
*  with other like minded nations to take people in. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=245.72000000000003s)]
*  And you could imagine all kinds of different efforts [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=249.3s)]
*  that are already being discussed to help people and civilians [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=251.86s)]
*  in particular not be present when there are impending [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=255.86s)]
*  and significant violent attacks that are coming and already present. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=259.56s)]
*  So those are the types of things that we've seen work in some other settings [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=263.8s)]
*  because I just keep coming back to this basic point. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=268.24s)]
*  It is in our national security interest and Israel's national security interest [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=271.0s)]
*  to be on the right side. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=275.88s)]
*  And right now, Israel is 100 percent on the right side morally [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=278.38s)]
*  and from a defense perspective to protect itself and to protect its people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=283.44s)]
*  and to respond to a horrific, condoned terrorist attack. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=287.68s)]
*  If you're trying to help Israel, you want Israel to maintain that position [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=291.98s)]
*  in the region and the world for many, many weeks, months and years to come. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  As you mentioned, there are already so many people that were food insecure. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=301.06s)]
*  And since this sort of siege has happened, Israel has, in essence, cut off [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=306.86s)]
*  food, water, electricity that is inevitably going to force [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=313.66s)]
*  an enormous outflow of human beings. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=317.90000000000003s)]
*  And again, kind of drawing back on your experiences, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=320.54s)]
*  how do you prepare the neighborhood, the countries nearby [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  to try to accept human beings that are fleeing for their lives? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=326.98s)]
*  Well, this is where America has to help the neighbors. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=331.92s)]
*  You know, during during the crisis in Syria, we we provided [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=334.72s)]
*  debt relief and access to capital markets for Jordan. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=339.32s)]
*  We put resources into Jordan to build out Zotri, a large scale refugee camp. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=343.26s)]
*  We even built out water infrastructure to support [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=348.64s)]
*  the provision of public services to both refugees and Jordanians. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=351.48s)]
*  I think you need a full, engaged dialogue, taking into account [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  all three D's, defense, diplomacy and development to help neighboring countries [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  have the resources, have the support, have the external financing quickly [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=363.12s)]
*  to be able to take in as many people as they can [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  and protect civilian lives and frankly, protect Israel's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=371.22s)]
*  right to defend itself, which is sacrosanct. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=376.04s)]
*  You know, you've looked back on history at times and said, really, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=379.14s)]
*  it's in the shadow of World War Two that we have some of the greatest [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=382.74s)]
*  international institutions that we've created as humanity. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=385.7s)]
*  I mean, I know this is still the early days of this particular conflict, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=389.34000000000003s)]
*  but considering that it's such a has been such a long and intractable one. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  What are, you know, potential positive outcomes that we can work toward [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=398.74s)]
*  to prevent this from happening again? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, Hari, it is hard to be an optimist in this in this moment right now. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=406.42s)]
*  But I am an optimist and I wrote the book Big Bets because I've seen [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=410.72s)]
*  extraordinary progress be made in the heart of immense pain and suffering. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=414.86s)]
*  And you're right, after World War Two, America rebuilt Western Europe [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=420.76s)]
*  and created the diplomatic infrastructure through the UN [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=424.86s)]
*  and the development infrastructure through the World Bank and the IMF [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=428.36s)]
*  that helped lift up hundreds of millions of people and maintain [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=431.76s)]
*  some degree of peace and stability through that Western alliance. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=435.06s)]
*  I think coming out of this, we're going to have that same moment again. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=439.64s)]
*  We've already been in a moment where lower income countries [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=443.3s)]
*  have been diverging from upper income countries in their recovery from covid. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=447.2s)]
*  It's been one of the first times since World War Two, you saw divergence there. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=451.7s)]
*  And that has accelerated food crises, fuel crises [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=455.7s)]
*  and political instability around the world. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=459.74s)]
*  This is a moment where we should be thinking aggressively about how to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=462.32s)]
*  reengage the diplomatic effort in the region. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=465.86s)]
*  And frankly, it's an opportunity to create the institutions [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=469.02s)]
*  and mobilize the resources for the long term peace [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=472.82s)]
*  that I hope will come after this, you know, tragic war. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=477.02s)]
*  Well, one of the ideas you write about in the book and you gathered this [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=480.82s)]
*  from the head of the Gates Foundation at the time was kind of starting [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=484.76s)]
*  with the blank page. And how do you get leaders to sit down [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=488.76s)]
*  at a table and start thinking about a blank page? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  When usually there's so much subtext, there's so much in the background, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=498.53999999999996s)]
*  there's so much sort of sometimes history, sometimes painful history [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=502.18s)]
*  that people want to bring up. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  And that can be between adversaries on a battlefield [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=507.5s)]
*  or a boardroom or anywhere else. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=511.24s)]
*  Well, you know, I write about it in the book in the context of the very early [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=514.74s)]
*  days of Bill and Melinda Gates's extraordinary philanthropic efforts. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=518.48s)]
*  And they wanted to immunize every child on the planet because they had read [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=522.1800000000001s)]
*  an article about 600000 kids dying of a disease that was killing kids [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=525.38s)]
*  in poor countries. This was rotavirus. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=529.82s)]
*  But vaccines were available only in rich countries where kids weren't dying. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=532.02s)]
*  And they just said, that's wrong. Why? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=535.32s)]
*  And by asking simple questions and starting with a blank page, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=537.42s)]
*  you have the ability to reimagine what the future could look like. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=541.66s)]
*  And the book Big Bets is really about reimagining those futures, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=546.06s)]
*  sitting down with the right people and saying, look, right now [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=549.72s)]
*  I would start sort of second and third track planning efforts [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=552.9399999999999s)]
*  with the partners that will be involved in the post-conflict environment [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=556.34s)]
*  to create more stability and more peace and more growth [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=561.3s)]
*  and infrastructure and development opportunities. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=564.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, the United States already provides significant [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=567.3s)]
*  infrastructure support for the West Bank, for example, via Israel, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=570.04s)]
*  via Israeli financial institutions and with the with the explicit support [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  of the Israeli government, because they know that human opportunity [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=579.9399999999999s)]
*  and human dignity is ultimately the baseline for stability and peace. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=583.88s)]
*  And right now we're in a global food crisis where food prices [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=589.78s)]
*  have been elevated because of Ukraine war. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=593.76s)]
*  But they're also elevated because climate change is causing a 30 percent [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=595.72s)]
*  reduction in food production in many agrarian economies around the world. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=599.0600000000001s)]
*  And we're systematically seeing hunger go up by tens [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=603.72s)]
*  or hundreds of millions of people over the next several years. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=607.7s)]
*  And we know that's going to lead to conflict and instability, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=611.34s)]
*  as it did after the crisis of food, fuel and financial crisis of 2008. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=613.96s)]
*  I write in the book about a big global effort President Obama made [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=618.1800000000001s)]
*  to have a big bet to address that food security crisis [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=621.48s)]
*  and succeeded by moving almost 100 million people out of hunger [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=625.14s)]
*  and poverty over a decade. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=629.4s)]
*  Those big efforts can be successful. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=631.48s)]
*  It's just too often because of what you mentioned, we just don't aspire [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=634.34s)]
*  to do the right thing with with the right level of resources [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=639.08s)]
*  and the right level of commitment. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=641.92s)]
*  One of the big bets you talk about is an assist that you provided [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=643.88s)]
*  to Mitch Landrieu and in New Orleans and his challenge [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  at the time to you was to help him basically get rid of some [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=654.22s)]
*  of the Confederate monuments or move them out of the city center, so to speak. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=658.9200000000001s)]
*  You write that a big bet can feel small in scope [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=663.78s)]
*  and still lead to large scale change. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=666.78s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=669.02s)]
*  Well, all big bets start with small initial steps. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=670.48s)]
*  And Mitch is an extraordinary leader. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=673.62s)]
*  You know, as mayor, he got to know every member of his community [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=675.72s)]
*  and worked with community members over years to build a real dialogue [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=679.76s)]
*  about racial understanding and came to understand [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  that these four Confederate statues, one of which was literally a monument [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=688.38s)]
*  to a white terrorist attack on the integrated police force [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=693.08s)]
*  of New Orleans in the post-Reconstruction era, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  that these monuments were seen as lifting up [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=701.62s)]
*  and elevating racial hatred to certain communities in New Orleans. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=706.52s)]
*  And so he worked with everybody to get everyone to agree to take them down. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=711.42s)]
*  And he got some resources. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  He started on that path. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=717.56s)]
*  And then the contractor who was doing that work had their car fire [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=719.06s)]
*  bombed by an outside, you know, white supremacist group. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=723.22s)]
*  And all of a sudden, the project looked like it would fail. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=728.78s)]
*  So Mitch asked me for help. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=730.92s)]
*  It was I was early on the job at the Rockefeller Foundation, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=732.22s)]
*  and I took the risk to invest in Mitch's big bet [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=735.12s)]
*  because he had had so much community engagement [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=738.32s)]
*  and had aligned stars the right way. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=741.32s)]
*  We took those statues down and, you know, we didn't know this, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=743.68s)]
*  but that then led to a dialogue across the country. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=746.96s)]
*  It went on to Charlottesville and and beyond, as many of your viewers will know, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=750.26s)]
*  and created a real movement around this effort. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=754.38s)]
*  And you never know when your community activism, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=757.52s)]
*  which might feel like it's linked only to your community, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=761.08s)]
*  will will change the way people think and imagine their futures. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=763.78s)]
*  I myself remember driving by so many of these monuments, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=767.5799999999999s)]
*  not thinking enough about what do they really mean? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=771.24s)]
*  Where did they really come from? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=773.54s)]
*  When were they really built and why? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=774.78s)]
*  And I'm proud of Mitch. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=777.72s)]
*  I'm proud of the community he represented for doing that. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=779.18s)]
*  And I'm proud of my own team for taking some risks and supporting him. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=781.68s)]
*  Another big bet that you're still engaged in now [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=785.52s)]
*  through the Rockefeller Foundation is climate change. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=788.78s)]
*  How do you even figure out kind of what that simple question should be, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  how you attack such a massive problem with so many different causes, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=796.7399999999999s)]
*  so many different effects? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=800.9399999999999s)]
*  Lead me through like you're thinking about it. Sure. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=803.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, we've had for 110 years a mission of lifting up humanity [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  and in particular, vulnerable communities using science and innovation. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=811.5799999999999s)]
*  That's that's the founding principle of the Rockefeller Foundation. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=815.5799999999999s)]
*  And when we look at climate change, we see we're blowing past [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=818.94s)]
*  all the ecosystem tipping points, whether it's ice melt or El Nino effects [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=822.64s)]
*  or heat in particular. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=828.44s)]
*  And we are doing that in a way that is nowhere near [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  the trajectory of the Paris agreement of one and a half degrees centigrade, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=835.2800000000001s)]
*  which came to represent a target the whole world could adopt and abide by and live with. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  And so we said, well, what's the most effective thing we can do? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=844.72s)]
*  And as we did analysis, we found that by 2050, 80, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=847.42s)]
*  81 countries around the world that are today relatively lower income [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=851.38s)]
*  will account for nearly all 75 plus percent of carbon emissions. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=855.8199999999999s)]
*  And even as we're taking down coal and moving to renewable energy [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=860.2199999999999s)]
*  in the United States and Europe and China in developing nations around the world, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=864.56s)]
*  we're actually building more coal every year, more heavy fuel oil every year, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=868.86s)]
*  more diesel generation every year. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=872.52s)]
*  And it's both a huge constraint to growth and economic job creation, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=874.8399999999999s)]
*  and it's going to be the one thing that kills our chance of achieving [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=879.24s)]
*  anything close to one and a half or two degrees warming on a global basis. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=884.24s)]
*  So we got a bunch of companies together. We got scientists together. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=888.52s)]
*  We invented some new technologies that can provide distributed [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=891.62s)]
*  renewable electrification to very poor communities and built an alliance [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=895.38s)]
*  of unlikely partners raised about eleven and a half billion dollars. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=899.48s)]
*  Today, we're active in about 22 countries, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=903.28s)]
*  reaching millions of people with renewable energy that would otherwise [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=905.98s)]
*  not have had access to power outside of some diesel generators. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=909.48s)]
*  And it's changing their lives for the better. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=914.12s)]
*  And it's offsetting and displacing coal, heavy fuel oil and diesel [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=916.54s)]
*  and hopefully protecting our planet for the future. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=921.02s)]
*  Our big bet is we can accelerate the momentum [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=923.08s)]
*  and actually bring a billion people power and energy [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=926.54s)]
*  that don't have access to electricity at all today. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=929.64s)]
*  And in the future, they will through new renewable technology. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=932.6999999999999s)]
*  At the end of each of your chapters, you essentially have kind of a checklist [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=936.5999999999999s)]
*  of things that people should do if they're trying to make big bets. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=939.9399999999999s)]
*  And you write in the book that this is you're you're optimistic [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=944.0s)]
*  to say that this is for everyone, that you don't have to be a billionaire [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=949.4399999999999s)]
*  to start making big bets and changing the world. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=952.5999999999999s)]
*  But having that access to capital, having the access [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=955.64s)]
*  to institutions of knowledge, whether it's higher education or think tanks, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=960.7s)]
*  et cetera, how does, you know, the average person [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=965.96s)]
*  that might be picking the book up at an airport [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=969.36s)]
*  have the ability within themselves to make these big bets to change the world? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=971.86s)]
*  Well, I think the first is truly the mindset. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=977.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, we are bombarded by news out there that is tough, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=979.76s)]
*  that is negative, that tells us we're facing a climate emergency [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=984.84s)]
*  that highlights conflicts and disasters without putting as much energy [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=988.0s)]
*  into highlighting the tremendous progress that's been made over years [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=992.9s)]
*  that I write about in the book to really bring dignity to people [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=996.74s)]
*  who haven't had it for decades. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=999.9s)]
*  And so the first step is to I'm asking readers to pick up the book [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1003.04s)]
*  in the hopes that they will be more optimistic, more ambitious [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1007.5s)]
*  on behalf of what's possible and to kind of crowd out the social media [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1010.7s)]
*  and the noise that breeds a sort of cynicism in us. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1014.74s)]
*  I think the second is no matter what you do, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1018.0s)]
*  if you're really committed to these types of efforts, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1020.6s)]
*  you can find a way to participate. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1023.24s)]
*  Like I've worked with big companies like Unilever on soap distribution campaigns [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1025.04s)]
*  and slums in urban communities all around the world. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1030.9s)]
*  And I've seen employees from those companies find a sense of meaning [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1034.3s)]
*  and purpose in what is otherwise a great job, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1038.14s)]
*  but a great job at a consumer products company. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1041.8s)]
*  And all of a sudden they kind of come alive because they say, hey, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1044.2s)]
*  I'm doing my job, but my job is saving lives. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1047.5s)]
*  And I want more CEOs, more corporate partners to get in the habit [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1050.14s)]
*  of seeing the meaning and purpose in their mission and their work [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1055.4s)]
*  and allowing their teams to participate in that. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1059.24s)]
*  The book is called Big Bets, How Large Scale Change Really Happens, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1061.9s)]
*  author and president of the Rockefeller Foundation, Dr. Rajiv Shah. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1065.8400000000001s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1069.1000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much, Hari. Great to be with you. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_ZM2U6teU&t=1070.54s)]
