# Dems are ‘burning their party to the ground,’ argues Gutfeld
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc)
*  It's a legitimate social action on the left. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=0.0s)]
*  And number two, climate change activism was always theater. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  The concern for the planet went out the window [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=7.32s)]
*  when their largesse was threatened by Doge, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  and now they can torch their holy grail, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=12.48s)]
*  which is the electric car. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=14.48s)]
*  So they aren't actually burning Tesla to the ground. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=15.82s)]
*  They're burning their party to the ground, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  and I brought marshmallows. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=21.42s)]
*  Okay, Jessica, the Dems have railed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=23.82s)]
*  against domestic terrorism for years, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=25.84s)]
*  and in fact, the 13 who had proposed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=28.24s)]
*  a federal domestic terrorism law [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=30.4s)]
*  apparently refused to respond to Fox News [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=32.56s)]
*  as to whether or not they felt that they agreed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=37.68s)]
*  with this being domestic terrorism. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=41.68s)]
*  I don't know who they were. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=45.32s)]
*  I would advise anyone who can go on the record [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  and is in any position of power [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=50.2s)]
*  to come on and denounce any violent action. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=52.2s)]
*  I think it's pretty simple. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=54.72s)]
*  How come we've only heard of Ro Khanna, though? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=55.56s)]
*  Well, there have been more people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=57.84s)]
*  who have said stuff about that for sure. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  I think Bernie has talked about it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett has spoken about it, and she's been... [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=63.6s)]
*  She's behind March 29th. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=66.12s)]
*  But she said, don't be violent. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=68.48s)]
*  She said that while saying, it's my birthday. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=70.16s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=72.5s)]
*  Elon's gonna go down. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=73.48s)]
*  Come on. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=75.2s)]
*  Okay, do you want to then take responsibility [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  for everyone who sent a pipe bomb [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  that was influenced by Donald Trump? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=81.94s)]
*  Anyone who... What pipe bomb? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=83.92s)]
*  What? What pipe bomb? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=85.16s)]
*  The guy from Florida who was sending pipe bombs [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=86.32s)]
*  to prominent Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=88.8s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, George Soros. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Is that now a... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=93.63999999999999s)]
*  So you got one example. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  No, I don't have one. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=95.32s)]
*  What I say, well, people who show up [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=96.16s)]
*  and shoot up Walmarts looking for brown people, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=97.52s)]
*  you want to take... [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  People who've been influenced by Donald Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=100.88s)]
*  But that's not Donald Trump calling for that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  The Democrats are calling for the destruction. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  No one is calling. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=107.8s)]
*  Tim Walz is calling for the destruction of the company. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=108.63999999999999s)]
*  He's saying he wants the stock to go down, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=111.56s)]
*  and I said yesterday, I thought that it was really stupid, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  and Ro Khanna is right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=115.22s)]
*  He has 20,000 people who work at Tesla. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=116.5s)]
*  There are hundreds of millions of dollars in Tesla stock [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=118.7s)]
*  that fuel these pensions or fund these pensions, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=121.3s)]
*  I should say. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=123.66s)]
*  That part of it absolutely has to stop. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=126.02s)]
*  If you don't want to buy the car, don't buy the car. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=127.94s)]
*  If you want to sell the car, sell the car. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=129.46s)]
*  But Donald Trump's saying on Truth Social [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=131.7s)]
*  that maybe you'll go to El Salvador. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=134.54s)]
*  At this moment, when the ACLU attorneys are reporting [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=139.1s)]
*  that people have been falsely sent to El Salvador, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=142.1s)]
*  which is what we said was going to happen, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=144.5s)]
*  they're being sent back because guess what? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=146.46s)]
*  They're not Venezuelan, and also they sent some women, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=148.22s)]
*  and El Salvador doesn't want to take women. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=150.78s)]
*  Are you going to finally admit that the way [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=153.9s)]
*  that they are vetting these people is inaccurate? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=155.9s)]
*  Oh, you're into vetting now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=160.14s)]
*  Vetting is good now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=161.46s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=162.78s)]
*  You guys are so cool. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=163.62s)]
*  What about the Venezuelan soccer player [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=164.46s)]
*  who was tortured by the Maduro regime [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=166.24s)]
*  and was sent to El Salvador? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=168.1s)]
*  He had a legitimate asylum claim, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=169.34s)]
*  went through a legal port of entry. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=170.66s)]
*  What about the Americans who've been murdered by illegals? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=171.5s)]
*  Let's not do all this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=174.02s)]
*  Why not? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=175.3s)]
*  Because it doesn't suit you right now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  Democrats and whether or not they're voicing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  any kind of negative, it's not ridiculous. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=180.78s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=183.5s)]
*  The question was a simple one, and you can't answer it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=184.34s)]
*  I did answer it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=186.38s)]
*  I answered it explicitly because I'm a grownup. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=187.26000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=189.74s)]
*  And I can say, oh, Janine asked me a question. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=190.58s)]
*  Here's my answer. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=192.10000000000002s)]
*  Also, Janine, then could you answer my question? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=192.94s)]
*  Do you think it's okay that innocent people [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=195.34s)]
*  are being sent to a foreign gulag? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=196.9s)]
*  I think that what's important is that we get rid of, okay. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=199.18s)]
*  I think what's important is that we get rid [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=202.78s)]
*  of the criminals in this country, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=204.66s)]
*  that your favorite president allowed to come [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=206.26s)]
*  into this country and create- [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=208.26s)]
*  But these aren't criminals. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=209.1s)]
*  To create all kinds of havoc in this country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=210.98s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=213.54s)]
*  If you want to talk about vetting, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=214.38s)]
*  then we have to talk about Joe. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=215.36s)]
*  But Jesse, let me ask you this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=217.0s)]
*  Is it time to invest in Tesla? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=218.3s)]
*  I'm invested. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=222.02s)]
*  I've been invested, so go for it if you want. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=222.9s)]
*  Am I in trouble now, Jessica? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=226.6s)]
*  I probably am invested too. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=228.06s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=231.9s)]
*  So tell your people to stop firebombing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=232.82s)]
*  I have. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=234.82s)]
*  80% of the country is not happy with the services [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=235.66s)]
*  that they get from the federal government. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  So Donald Trump's response is, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  let's make things more efficient. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=242.1s)]
*  And their response is, let's throw Molotov cocktails. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=243.8s)]
*  So we're either dealing with the mob [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=247.02s)]
*  or we're dealing with children. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  And you have to deal with these people the same way. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=250.1s)]
*  Discipline, not sexually, behind bars, Jessica. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=251.9s)]
*  And notice all the suspects are trans. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=256.5s)]
*  Have you seen these mugshots? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=258.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=260.26s)]
*  What is going on with the connection [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=261.1s)]
*  between militancy, transgenderism, and mental illness? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  I'm just raising questions here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=267.64000000000004s)]
*  Maybe some PhD can look into it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=269.58000000000004s)]
*  But every time I see eco-terrorism, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=271.58000000000004s)]
*  every time I see Tesla terrorism, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  any time I see Antifa terrorism, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=277.18s)]
*  or bathroom terrorism, if that's even a thing, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=280.3s)]
*  it's a big person with purple hair [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=283.42s)]
*  and you can't really tell what gender they are. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=285.1s)]
*  Terry Nadler is guilty of that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=286.82000000000005s)]
*  Bathroom terrorism. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  Musk, Greg is right, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=290.34s)]
*  they're giving him the Trump treatment. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=292.06s)]
*  And we saw what happened, they tried to kill him twice. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=293.5s)]
*  If they kill Musk, we're not gonna go to Mars, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=296.17999999999995s)]
*  we're not gonna have cars, and we're not having robots. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=298.73999999999995s)]
*  I have always wanted a robot, Jessica. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  It's basically- [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=304.26s)]
*  You do, it's Johnny. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=305.09999999999997s)]
*  But we have to pay and feed him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  Johnny complains too much for testing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=308.97999999999996s)]
*  I want a genius butler to follow me around [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=309.82s)]
*  and do whatever I want. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=312.5s)]
*  Don't deny that to me, Jessica, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  because that's where we're going here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=315.58s)]
*  The media always thought they had this clever question. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=317.29999999999995s)]
*  I remember, do you believe the 2020 election was stolen [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=319.42s)]
*  and thought it was this big gotcha? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=323.5s)]
*  Well, let's go ask the Democrats. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=325.22s)]
*  Do you believe these people should be torching cars? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=327.54s)]
*  Do you believe that an American company [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=333.18s)]
*  should lose 100,000 workers because of fire bombings? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=336.22s)]
*  I'm gonna send Johnny, my robot, to DC on Monday [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=340.70000000000005s)]
*  when they're back from recess to ask these questions [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=344.1s)]
*  because they should have to answer it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=346.3s)]
*  You think they will? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=349.3s)]
*  I'd like to see them try. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like to see them try too. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=351.54s)]
*  You just want Johnny out of the state. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=352.38s)]
*  I mean, I would love to have seen the outrage [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=353.22s)]
*  when people were crossing over the border [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=355.5s)]
*  and it was just completely out of control. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=357.5s)]
*  Where were the activist judges saying, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=360.3s)]
*  wait a minute, we have a border there, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=362.66s)]
*  you're not really allowed to let people [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=364.1s)]
*  across these borders, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=365.7s)]
*  and then they were taking the lives [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=366.54s)]
*  of people like Lake and Raleigh. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  So I think there's a lot more sympathy [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  on that side of the equation than there is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=370.3s)]
*  for someone who may have been mistakenly, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=372.54s)]
*  who crossed the border mistakenly taken somewhere else, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=374.42s)]
*  and now they have to iron that process out. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=378.06s)]
*  I do think that this domestic terrorism issue is real. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=380.14000000000004s)]
*  This is scary. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=384.58000000000004s)]
*  Someone's gonna get hurt in all of this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=386.1s)]
*  People are burning cars. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=388.06s)]
*  This is not a nothing. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=389.38s)]
*  It is domestic terrorism, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=390.86s)]
*  and the sentence for that is five to 20 years. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=392.38s)]
*  So yes, they will go to some prison or institution [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=395.38s)]
*  if they're convicted of all of this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=399.3s)]
*  And I think that's why I feel for Elon Musk [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  in this situation, he had to go talk [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=404.14000000000004s)]
*  to the people that worked for him. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=405.5s)]
*  I'm sure they're also worried about what's going on. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=406.98s)]
*  They're probably worried for their own safety. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=409.82s)]
*  I think that's why President Trump last week [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=411.86s)]
*  did the row of Teslas outside the White House. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  He's trying to support the person [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=415.74s)]
*  that he's working so closely with [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=417.42s)]
*  in a time that is scary for them and for the company. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  And I'm trying to figure out what people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=422.22s)]
*  are so deeply outraged about. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  We have a $9.7 trillion budget, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=427.98s)]
*  and he cut $115 billion. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=432.22s)]
*  Is this what people are so upset about? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=435.94s)]
*  Minus dual cuts? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=441.22s)]
*  What are they so angry at him about? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=443.1s)]
*  I'm glad that you admit that he's so ineffectual, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=444.94s)]
*  but what they are upset about is that someone [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=446.02000000000004s)]
*  who is unelected is coming in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=448.1s)]
*  and haphazardly firing tens of thousands of people, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=449.66s)]
*  cutting programs, having to reinstate it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=452.78000000000003s)]
*  65,000 people, many of whom weren't showing up for work. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=454.62s)]
*  Anyway, when these kind of cuts happen [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=457.94s)]
*  in corporate America, do these people freak out [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=459.86s)]
*  and say, oh, a board member suggested these cuts, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=462.06s)]
*  and I'm outraged? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=464.3s)]
*  He didn't just suggest it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=465.14s)]
*  He's marching in everywhere, and he's executing them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=465.98s)]
*  He's executing them. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=469.7s)]
*  He's not killing anyone. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=470.54s)]
*  I love the active verb there. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=472.38s)]
*  Up next, the progressive Bonnie and Clyde [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=475.1s)]
*  are hitting the road. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=477.66s)]
*  AOC and Bernie Sanders are bringing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=479.22s)]
*  their wonderful radical message to a town hall near you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=481.54s)]
*  Where else? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QASTjEOWFIc&t=494.3s)]
