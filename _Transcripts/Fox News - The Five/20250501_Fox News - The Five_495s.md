# 'The Five': Why Elon doesn't want to leave DOGE
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY)
*  He's saying Namaste after cleaning up the Beltway. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon has given his exit interview as he gets ready to depart the Department of Government [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=3.56s)]
*  Efficiency. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=7.72s)]
*  But the billionaire bad boy insisted his transition doesn't mean the Doge mission is over. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=8.9s)]
*  He said, quote, Doge is a way of life like Buddhism. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  Buddha isn't alive anymore. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=17.48s)]
*  You wouldn't ask the question who would lead Buddhism. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=19.28s)]
*  Some guy named Jesse got an exclusive with Musk and big balls. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Is Doge just getting started? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=27.54s)]
*  This is a long term enterprise. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=30.04s)]
*  It's a long term enterprise because if we take our eye off the ball, the waste and fraud [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=33.0s)]
*  will come roaring back. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=37.16s)]
*  They can doge doge when Democrats get back in power. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=38.96s)]
*  We're trying to have it be such that the funding is removed, so the grants are gone. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=43.12s)]
*  So there's a lot of work required to restart the waste and fraud. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=48.94s)]
*  Do these people not respect taxpayer money? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=54.84s)]
*  I mean, there's no incentive to if you work in the government. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=58.2s)]
*  I think the incentives will always decide the outcomes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=61.92s)]
*  And you know, the way that the payment system is set up is if you ask for money, you're [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=65.12s)]
*  just going to get it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  Big balls has big hair. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=72.8s)]
*  But Doge's greatest legacy could be making it fashionable to cut government waste. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  Check out Greasy trying to take credit. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=78.6s)]
*  I could have easily come in here with sunglasses and, you know, chainsaws. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=81.92s)]
*  You know where I'm going. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=91.0s)]
*  We're doge, but better. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=92.56s)]
*  And we've been doge, but better for literally six years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=94.52s)]
*  Literally, literally better. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=98.72s)]
*  Jesse, it is a good question. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=101.4s)]
*  Will Doge continue with the same momentum and excitement without Musk helming? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=103.44s)]
*  He doesn't want to leave. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=110.2s)]
*  He's having a lot of fun. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=112.48s)]
*  He might dial it back a little bit, but he's having the time of his life. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=114.10000000000001s)]
*  He likes these guys that work for him a lot. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=119.08s)]
*  They had a pizza party before I got there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=122.12s)]
*  They're listening to music. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=124.48s)]
*  He was dancing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  And there's like a military camaraderie with this team. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=128.12s)]
*  And I kept on asking him, you know, like, is this like the end for you? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=135.68s)]
*  And he's like, where'd you hear that? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=139.84s)]
*  And I said, well, I heard it in the media. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=141.56s)]
*  He said, where? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=142.56s)]
*  Where'd you hear it from? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=143.56s)]
*  In the media. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=144.56s)]
*  He said, well, who? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=145.56s)]
*  I don't think he's accepted that he's leaving. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=146.56s)]
*  And even if he does take a step back, he'll still be there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=151.36s)]
*  He's so involved in this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's a good thing because they're doing a lot of work. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=156.52s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Judge, the Dems are offering no solution for this impending financial collapse [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=158.4s)]
*  if we don't cut the cut the debt. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=165.2s)]
*  But they'd rather just lie that he's cutting actual benefits. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=167.92s)]
*  Why don't they just admit that they should get on board? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=171.8s)]
*  Look, only the Dems would act like saving one hundred and sixty billion dollars doesn't [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=175.48s)]
*  mean a damn thing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=181.0s)]
*  Only the Dems would rather hate on Musk than benefit the American people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=182.44s)]
*  And only the Dems would predict that there would be all of this trauma and tragedy, that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  this one's going to lose their Social Security and this one's going to lose their Medicaid. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=192.76s)]
*  None of that happened. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=196.96s)]
*  It's all fear mongering. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=198.32s)]
*  And, you know, I believe that Musk doesn't want to go. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=199.8s)]
*  He's also a special government employee after 130 days. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=202.6s)]
*  But I still I'm still not clear if those 130 days have to be consecutive, you know, and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=205.68s)]
*  whether or not he gets more days. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=210.96s)]
*  But that's really not the point. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=212.4s)]
*  But greasy Gavin getting up there and saying, you know, I can do Doge better. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  And when he honestly started with the sunglasses, I thought he was talking about Biden. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=219.44s)]
*  But, you know, he says he's going to balance the budget in California. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=223.52s)]
*  They're bleeding cash in California. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=228.48s)]
*  In 2023, there was a forty six billion dollar, thirty two billion dollar deficit. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=230.96s)]
*  A year later, there's a double forty six billion dollar deficit. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=237.88s)]
*  Newsom needed to borrow six billion dollars to keep Medicaid afloat. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=242.36s)]
*  Medicaid, as we know, we got an additional two million illegals on Medicaid. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=247.92s)]
*  And everybody says, oh, you know, we don't we don't want to take it away. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=252.72s)]
*  Well, I actually believe if you come to this country, you should be able to provide for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=255.96s)]
*  yourself if you don't want to work otherwise, go home. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=260.24s)]
*  But that's just me. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=262.84s)]
*  Jessica, that is another achievement of Doge. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  When you have Democrats getting on board by saying we can do it better, that's a win. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=266.76s)]
*  I mean, we're not, you know, Republicans aren't saying, hey, we're doing this and you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=272.68s)]
*  aren't we're saying we're doing this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=276.72s)]
*  Why don't you do it, too? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=278.36s)]
*  And having Gavin say that is kind of a victory for everybody. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  Sure. But Gavin is just returning to the legacy of Doge, which is Bill Clinton and Al Gore [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  is from the 90s when they did it the right way and they actually consulted with Congress. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=289.32000000000005s)]
*  And who cares who's first, Jess? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  You just you want the win. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=294.68s)]
*  I'm happy that everybody's joining. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=296.16s)]
*  Kumbaya. Exactly. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=298.56s)]
*  Namaste. Yes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=300.44000000000005s)]
*  Namaste, my friends. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  Why don't Democrats care about the debt? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=304.48s)]
*  Go back through history and look at who adds more to the debt. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=307.64s)]
*  And it is the Republicans. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=311.64s)]
*  Look at the reconciliation bill that they want to push through. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=312.8s)]
*  Four point five trillion. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=314.96s)]
*  Don't. Donald Trump added more than everyone. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=316.24s)]
*  We can wait for that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=319.4s)]
*  Yeah, let's wait for it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=320.2s)]
*  Let's also talk about the clear failure of Doge based on their own set goals. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=321.72s)]
*  We started at two trillion and we moved to one trillion. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=326.2s)]
*  Now we're at one hundred and sixty billion. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=328.96s)]
*  But yeah, right now, it keeps adding up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=330.92s)]
*  It is a problem. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=334.0s)]
*  You want to always compare things. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=335.24s)]
*  I didn't see Congress doing that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=336.6s)]
*  If you want to, which you always do, to compare this to private sector standards, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=339.76s)]
*  if you hired McKinsey to come in and to cut two trillion, then they said, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=343.48s)]
*  oh, we'll get you one billion. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=347.36s)]
*  They say we'll get you one hundred and sixty billion. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=348.32s)]
*  You'd say you're not doing a very good job. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=350.4s)]
*  And also, maybe you were spreading lies about what's actually going on in the federal government. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=352.28s)]
*  One point six billion a day so far. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=356.44s)]
*  But the real story of Doge is that Elon Musk has thirty eight billion dollars [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=357.96s)]
*  in government contracts, has not had a penny of his money touched while he's going around [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=362.32s)]
*  cutting other people's contracts. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=366.64s)]
*  And there was a new congressional report out this week that found that he was up for two point [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  three seven billion in potential fines across eleven agencies. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=372.56s)]
*  And what has he been doing? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  He has been cutting the people who are investigating him. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=377.68s)]
*  If that doesn't smell like corruption, I don't know what is up for a fine. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=381.0s)]
*  Let's make sure that he gets a fine before you start saying he's up for it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=385.2s)]
*  If you get rid of the investigator. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=389.52s)]
*  You were an investigator. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=391.08s)]
*  I certainly was. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=392.12s)]
*  And if there's a potential crime and then you have the evidence to prove it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=393.28s)]
*  It's all laid out, by the way, in the pages of First of all, he had all those government [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iy9xHziBY&t=397.88s)]
