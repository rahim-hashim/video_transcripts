# Even the liberal media is ‘shying away’ from this 'staged photo-op' gone wrong: Gutfeld #shorts #usa
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ)
*  Look, you spent two years saying no one is above the law, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and now you say if they could do this to a senator, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=3.36s)]
*  they could do it to anyone. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  You can't have both. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=6.9s)]
*  They're both contradictory, you know? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=8.34s)]
*  It's like the agents did their jobs. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=11.0s)]
*  They should be commended [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=13.84s)]
*  for treating every potential threat equally. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=15.24s)]
*  And that was a potential threat. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=19.04s)]
*  Nobody knew who this guy was. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=20.22s)]
*  He was an aggressive protester walking in. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=21.68s)]
*  She's unarmed. She's vulnerable. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=24.82s)]
*  He's lucky he didn't get pummeled. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=27.98s)]
*  The great thing about this, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=30.38s)]
*  this was a staged photo op meant to go viral. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=32.26s)]
*  But even the legacy media is kind of shying away from it [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=37.02s)]
*  because the hoax apparatus, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  the one we've had to deal with for, I don't know, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=42.0s)]
*  four days, six years, has completely been destroyed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZP3sFXccQ&t=43.76s)]
