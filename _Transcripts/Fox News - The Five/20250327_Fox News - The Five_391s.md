# 'The Five' roasts the Left trying to 'seem tough'
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo)
*  The last strategy of trying to seem tough is a swing and a miss after weeks of potty mouth tie-raids a damn big gun [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's telling his party to stop shooting from the hip [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=6.48s)]
*  This party is scrambling trying to seem tough and and I'm seeing I'm seeing this party traffic and a lot of curse words [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=9.68s)]
*  That's supposed to like the new cool thing to do. I don't think that that's going to be as useful [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=17.72s)]
*  I even heard Pete Buttigieg [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=22.92s)]
*  With a whole bunch of curse words. I don't know who gave that memo. I don't think that's very useful [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=25.28s)]
*  Democrats are getting press on the effectiveness of using four-letter words [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=30.04s)]
*  I'm not a big swearer. I know my children are watching and other kids are watching [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=34.4s)]
*  Profanity is often used to express anger and I think it comes from an authentic place for democratic members [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=39.64s)]
*  across the country channeling those feelings in a variety of different ways [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=47.24s)]
*  Personally, I disagree with it [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=53.84s)]
*  I think what they're what they're channeling is the very strong anger that's out there in the public [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=55.64s)]
*  And while Tim Walz is still trying to load that shotgun JD van showing off his shot while hanging out with his fellow Marines that you [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=61.28s)]
*  Can see there Greg this reminds me of what you were talking about in the previous block, which is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  the Democrats tend to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=72.88s)]
*  Kind of get a bat signal. Yeah and say oh we have to do that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=75.16s)]
*  So when did the say a four-letter word to try to be persuasive memo go out to them? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=78.32s)]
*  Yeah, I don't recall saying that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=83.12s)]
*  You did and I'm just foreshadowing the next block on the NPR person sale clever that was yeah, you're right [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=85.64s)]
*  It's a sweat swearing for the sake of swearing and it never works the opposite of authenticity isn't fake [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=90.28s)]
*  It's you know being pretending to be authentic when somebody pretends to be authentic. It is painful [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=97.28s)]
*  The Democrats have become a theater troupe with every manufactured [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=103.24s)]
*  Hysteria their new amateur production. So instead of bye-bye birdie or fiddler on the roof, it's they're destroying democracy [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  with Adam Schiff or [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=115.72s)]
*  There's so he's saluting Hitler with Jasmine Crockett [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=117.52s)]
*  It's just like any play it has actors and props and scripts and after you watch it you want to throw up [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=121.36s)]
*  the question is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  If you take away identity politics, which I think is what's caused a lot of this what's left who are you? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=131.44s)]
*  You know if this is the lasting damage of this of this stuff if you have invested in a construct of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  Identity that is not a real version of you, you know, if you know if your definition is I'm a gay black male [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  What happens when society says we don't care? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  Then you got to figure out who you are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=153.6s)]
*  You have to re-examine who you are as a member of the human race [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=155.44s)]
*  And I think that's the problem you're seeing with Democrats and their fault. They don't know what they are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=159.32s)]
*  Yeah, Jesse, you don't know what you are. I know what I'm not [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=168.36s)]
*  Harold some of them almost seem like theater kids like [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  Older theater kids like they have to they're even writing in curse words and their written communication [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=173.44000000000003s)]
*  Look, I'm not a fan of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=179.52s)]
*  Cursed words in politics. I I'm no quarrel board when it comes to how I talk at times [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=181.16000000000003s)]
*  But I think in politics it goes on both sides Republicans and Democrats do it a lot [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=185.8s)]
*  President Trump had a few curse words the same campaigns [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  But I do think what Van Jones is talking about is right when you are cursing when you're when you are in the minority [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=193.42s)]
*  It almost appears like you've run out of ideas and you've run out of ways in which to present to the public [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=200.62s)]
*  Can you imagine if we were saying as Democrats? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  Again, we want every agency to cut 5% of their budget [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  We want to raise we want to cut taxes on tips and overtime for people earning up to $100,000 tips [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=214.14s)]
*  Matter of fact no taxes work with the president to do it [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=220.7s)]
*  Can you imagine if we said we want an education act that lifts every kid and we're willing to? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=223.38s)]
*  Be for vouchers and be for charter schools and be for school choice as long as the schools work [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  I know there's that we have a difference around the table probably four against one [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=232.64s)]
*  But I want the Department of Education involved in efforts like this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=236.16s)]
*  Can you imagine we said we're gonna raise the carried interest tax and raise taxes on those? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=239.3s)]
*  Earning over 25 million dollars a year to be able to pay for the tax cuts that we want for those working working Americans [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=242.78s)]
*  That's what Democrats ought to be offering get away from the cuss words [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=248.78s)]
*  Get away get away from the cuss words and get back to the substance. That was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  That was the platform. Yeah, Harold Ford Harold go get [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=257.26s)]
*  What do you think of this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=263.74s)]
*  Right, I mean that cursing does sound like you've run out of ideas and the Democrats don't have any ideas or leaderless [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=266.1s)]
*  They're rudderless. They don't have a policy [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=272.26s)]
*  They don't know what they stand for and it's almost like you've got a high school play and people like [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett are auditioning and they've tried everything they've tried [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=280.18s)]
*  protesting and then they tried singing and then they tried choose your fighter jumping up and down and punching and now they're they're [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=284.7s)]
*  Cursing and you know vanilla Pete Buttigieg is tweeting f-bombs to seem tough [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=292.18s)]
*  I mean like where are these people from who does that? I mean people curse all the time [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  Would you tell them Jesse to get it together? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  They have to look in their hearts [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not out there. You don't pay a consultant a million dollars to tell you to say the f-word [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=310.1s)]
*  You have to find out what you care about. We know what Trump cares about [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=314.26s)]
*  He cares about the Golden Age the border law and order making America great again [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  the American dream I [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=326.3s)]
*  Mean [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=328.3s)]
*  Everybody knows what he stands for but no one knows what the Democrats stand for Greg said it all last year all you heard [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=329.5s)]
*  democracy all this year is fu [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  They're not really angry. They're angry that their base is angry at them [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=340.1s)]
*  Yeah, if they were really angry, they'd be mad about the $5 gasoline [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=344.18s)]
*  They'd be mad that their kids were getting raped in a bathroom by a guy with a dress [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=348.42s)]
*  I saw real anger on the south side of Chicago [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=352.2s)]
*  When those people were mad that the migrants were coming in and taking up all their space that's real anger [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  This is just shock-chock. They're trying to get attention because their legacy media allies have no punching power anymore [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=360.97999999999996s)]
*  So they have to break through the news [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=367.62s)]
*  Noise on social media, but just because they're getting clicks doesn't mean it's good. Not all clicks are good clicks. Trust me [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvmU5riKpo&t=369.94s)]
