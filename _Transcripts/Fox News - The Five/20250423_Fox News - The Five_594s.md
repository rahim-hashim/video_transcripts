# ELON OUT?: ‘The Five’ on Musk's future at DOGE
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw)
*  They tangoed, they torched, and Tampon Tim even rooted for the stock to crash. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=0.0s)]
*  The left did everything they could to destroy Tesla as a way to stick it to Elon and Doge. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  But now they won't have ol' Elon to kick around anymore. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=12.68s)]
*  Musk says he's ready to ride off into the sunset after Doge claims it saved American [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=15.24s)]
*  taxpayers $160 billion and counting. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=19.92s)]
*  And probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=24.2s)]
*  I'll have to continue doing it for, I think, probably the remainder of the President's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=35.28s)]
*  term, just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stopped does not come roaring [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=41.6s)]
*  back. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=47.08s)]
*  I'm allocating far more of my time to Tesla. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=48.08s)]
*  And now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=53.12s)]
*  done. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=59.0s)]
*  But whose dealerships will the left graffiti now that Boogeyman Musk is going away? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=60.96s)]
*  And what electric cars will Walt Staffers vandalize and get away with it? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=66.4s)]
*  And who will arouse Joe Scarborough? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=71.14s)]
*  The last thing this guy needs to do right now when he's getting pounded is, what, has [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=74.36s)]
*  he lost $100, $150 billion? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=79.24s)]
*  It is time to go back to your day job. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=83.66s)]
*  Elon went with the chainsaw and the drama and I think ultimately it's reflected in these [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=86.76s)]
*  polling numbers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=91.38s)]
*  We're seeing this is just not a popular move. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=92.48s)]
*  He is not only like very sinister and has no idea what he's doing and people are like, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=95.52s)]
*  He absolutely knows because he's the richest man in the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=101.96s)]
*  Like, yes, he knows how to hire smart people, but don't conflate that and believe that he [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=104.84s)]
*  is the genius because he ain't. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=109.32s)]
*  You know, Harold, it seems like the Dems don't achieve anything. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=112.28s)]
*  And when somebody tries to do something like Elon did, they root against him. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=118.08s)]
*  You can't be for that, can you? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=123.98s)]
*  When you see that, like, we're dealing with a problem, which is economic collapse, which [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=125.9s)]
*  is the reason for Doge. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=130.4s)]
*  Why would you root against that? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  Why would you, Harold, root against that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  So it's good to be back with you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=135.16s)]
*  And you haven't lost your fastball. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=136.36s)]
*  I can see the, I'm not rooting, I never root against any great American company or great [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=138.0s)]
*  American business guy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=143.26s)]
*  I can disagree with them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=144.44s)]
*  And I think those in Congress, Democrat and Republican alike have disagreed with Mr. Must. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=145.52s)]
*  Let's get to the positive. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  Doge has been a great effort on the part of the White House to try to help highlight redundancies [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=152.16s)]
*  and highlight inefficiencies in our government, even to highlight ways in which we can think [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=158.42s)]
*  about reimagining agencies to do better things with less money. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=163.14s)]
*  I've always thought that the real opportunity for anyone to look at government efficiencies [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  was to say we scale what's working, be it tax cuts or spending, we reform what can be [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  fixed and we scrap what's not working. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  And they have not done all of that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=179.5s)]
*  It appears, at least according to our notes, that according to what Mr. Musk has been able [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  to do with Doge, they've estimated they're going to save some $150 to $160 billion. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=185.34s)]
*  We'll see if that's the case, which works out to be about $1,000 per taxpayer. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=188.94s)]
*  We'll take the savings. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  Now, I wouldn't blame it all on Dems. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, there are reports in newspapers today showing that Mr. Musk had disagreements with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=196.02s)]
*  one of our old colleagues, Mr. Duffy, the Secretary of Transportation, and even the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=200.3s)]
*  Secretary of Treasury, he and Mr. Beslin, apparently, according to press reports. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=203.34s)]
*  And you can't always believe those things, but according to press reports, they had their [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  differences. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=211.34s)]
*  I think the real legacy of this, Greg, is that Mr. Trump will now ask all of his agency [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=212.38s)]
*  heads to bring to him budgets that cut 2% to 4% of spending from what they spent last [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=216.9s)]
*  year and explain why and then go before the Congress and do that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=223.06s)]
*  That's the process by which this works. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=226.38s)]
*  So I congratulate him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=228.38s)]
*  I think he's leaving for a variety of reasons, not just because Jasmine Crockett said those [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=229.46s)]
*  things and maybe even because he wants to get back to his company and get his company [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=232.86s)]
*  roaring again like it was over the many, many years before he joined government. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=236.82s)]
*  You know, Jesse, this is shocking to politicians because they never know when to leave. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=240.62s)]
*  You know, Musk understays. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't overstay. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=247.38s)]
*  You know, you could just ask his baby mamas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=248.38s)]
*  How many? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  14. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  14 and counting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  Probably more. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=256.42s)]
*  The contribution that he made is not how much he saved the taxpayers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=258.02s)]
*  It's exposing how much Democrats stole from the taxpayers. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=261.86s)]
*  It's so easy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=265.86s)]
*  It's only three steps, Greg. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=266.9s)]
*  You are a Democrat. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=268.68s)]
*  You know a Democrat in D.C. and you get them to send you money. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=270.3s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=274.62s)]
*  And someone got a million dollars to clean up a beach. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=276.42s)]
*  Now if you get a DEI or DUI or DWI, they will make you clean up the beach for free as part [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=280.62s)]
*  of your community service or the beaches that I go to. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  The local government does it already. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=293.74s)]
*  The clothing optional ones. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=295.92s)]
*  You've been there? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=298.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=299.1s)]
*  I thought I saw something. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  I just needed to wear my glasses. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  And then they also have a million dollars that goes to Ocean Justice. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  Now if there was an auditor that came and asked you what you do with the money, what [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  would you say you spent a million dollars on Ocean Justice for? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  Did Al Sharpton come out to the beach and yell something in a bullhorn to the whale? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=316.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  But they stole the money. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=324.72s)]
*  And that's why Bondi has to get the prosecution referral and put some of these thieves in [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=326.38s)]
*  jail so they don't do it again. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=331.26s)]
*  He knew it wasn't going to be popular when he did this job. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=332.82s)]
*  It's like you come in and you're basically telling the whole government to strip naked [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=335.74s)]
*  and have all of these doctors look at every single imperfection. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  And then interview your lawyer and your ex-wife and your assistant. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=347.02s)]
*  It's like a full body cavity search and then you put it all on X. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=351.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=355.14s)]
*  No one wants that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=356.18s)]
*  No one. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=357.18s)]
*  But it had to have happened, Greg. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=358.18s)]
*  And thank God it did. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  And for this woman, what do they say? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=360.86s)]
*  God bless her heart. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=362.94s)]
*  Bless her heart. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=363.94s)]
*  God bless her heart. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=364.94s)]
*  When she says... [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=365.94s)]
*  She's saying that about you too, by the way. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=366.94s)]
*  He ain't a genius. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=368.58s)]
*  I think that says more about her than it does about him. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=371.58s)]
*  The only thing she's ever invented is a personality. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=373.78s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=376.53999999999996s)]
*  I've seen clips of her from a couple years ago. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  Something changed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=379.86s)]
*  Something changed. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=380.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=381.9s)]
*  Piggybacking on what Jesse said, that he knew it wouldn't be popular. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=383.85999999999996s)]
*  He did all this stuff knowing that it would negatively affect his wealth and his status [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=387.38s)]
*  and his public persona. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  That's a foreign concept to Democrats and the media. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=395.65999999999997s)]
*  Why would you do that to yourself? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=398.7s)]
*  Well you would only do it if you have a negative, intense corruption, something in the back [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=401.02s)]
*  of your head. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=406.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, why be a patriot? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=407.73999999999995s)]
*  Why give up your own business? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=409.94s)]
*  To go and find out where the waste, fraud and abuse is in the federal government. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=412.82000000000005s)]
*  Here's a shock. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=418.38000000000005s)]
*  Musk said that he would go as a special government employee within 130 days. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=420.66s)]
*  And he is. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=425.26000000000005s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=426.26000000000005s)]
*  Musk is doing what CEOs do. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=427.26000000000005s)]
*  They set up a company, they get people in place, and then they end up leaving. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  While the haters like Tampon Tim is saying, he's going to take a break from destroying [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=433.38s)]
*  your retirement plan to try to save his own. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=438.14000000000004s)]
*  Someone like Tampon Tim cheers that his own constituents are losing money because their [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=441.94s)]
*  pension plans are invested in Tesla. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=446.74s)]
*  And then you've got Crockett. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=449.7s)]
*  She thinks she's smarter than Donald Trump. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=451.21999999999997s)]
*  She thinks that the richest man in the world just hired the right people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=453.46s)]
*  Oh, if that were only the equation. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=456.9s)]
*  But what I love about this administration is that they just did what people said they [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=459.98s)]
*  couldn't do. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=465.1s)]
*  They said they can't get rid of the swamp and drain the swamp. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=466.5s)]
*  They said they can't get rid of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=469.74s)]
*  They said they can't root out corruption or close the border or make food healthier. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=472.42s)]
*  Well, they dared and they did it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=477.42s)]
*  And so now the question is going to be who's on deck next? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=479.66s)]
*  Who's going to be the boogeyman? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=483.02s)]
*  It's Trump, it's Musk, who's next? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=484.26s)]
*  But none of this is real. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=486.58s)]
*  It's all fake. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=488.02s)]
*  Dana, last word to you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=489.02s)]
*  I find it, it's kind of disturbing watching how the Dems choose the bad guys and fight [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=490.58s)]
*  the good guys. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=496.94s)]
*  It's weird to like they're on the bleachers heckling people who are actually doing something. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=498.3s)]
*  This isn't virtue signaling. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=503.58s)]
*  This is actual action. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=505.06s)]
*  Like if Elon Musk volunteered to spend 130 days in an El Salvador prison as an MS-13 [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=506.68s)]
*  gang member, they might come and visit him. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=512.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=514.0600000000001s)]
*  Be nice to him. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  I also wonder, I was thinking about Tim Walls. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  It was almost as if Elon Musk gave Tim Walls a reason to live. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=519.3s)]
*  And he was out and he did all those interviews. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=524.22s)]
*  And look at the damage that he did. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=526.26s)]
*  I think to his party, but also to a company, an American company, recommending the vandalism, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=528.1400000000001s)]
*  dismissing it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=536.3800000000001s)]
*  Now he has one of the people that works in his government, an alleged suspect who is [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=537.3800000000001s)]
*  going to be able to basically walk away without having to pay for that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=542.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think another thing we haven't mentioned is that, I'm so skeptical, and I'll look at [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=546.2600000000001s)]
*  the numbers on the money that's saved. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=551.1800000000001s)]
*  I think on some of the things that you were mentioning, for example, the trans opera in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=553.38s)]
*  Colombia. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=558.26s)]
*  Obviously nobody needs to be paying for that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=559.26s)]
*  But the fact that the government employees were saddled with these old computers and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=561.1s)]
*  terrible software, that's the kind of efficiency that could pay off in the long run if they [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=567.3000000000001s)]
*  were able to fix that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=571.26s)]
*  Mmm. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=572.38s)]
*  A trans opera. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=573.38s)]
*  Is it over when the fat man sings? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=575.58s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=577.58s)]
*  What next? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=580.78s)]
*  Democrat groupies gathering for their next deported star. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4cPdO90Nw&t=581.98s)]
