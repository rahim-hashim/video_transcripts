# ‘The Five’: Is this who Democrats want to be seen aligning with?
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg)
*  Okay, there is a lot to unpack here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=0.0s)]
*  Rosanna, I want to start with you. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=1.8s)]
*  She said you threaten them. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  She may want to clarify that, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=4.32s)]
*  but that is what she's caught on tape saying. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=5.66s)]
*  She's saying basically call and make themselves known. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=7.36s)]
*  But threaten is a different word when you say threaten. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=11.4s)]
*  And we've seen Maxine Waters say that too. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=14.48s)]
*  And people listen to them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, as we know, there are people in this society [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=18.28s)]
*  who take literally what you say. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=22.36s)]
*  And I don't know, I don't think it was a great idea. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=24.92s)]
*  Can we get back to the courtroom? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=27.68s)]
*  Because I think everybody is just trying to figure out [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=29.64s)]
*  what happened in that courtroom [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=32.72s)]
*  with the judge being arrested. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=34.24s)]
*  And yes, it's concerning, it's disappointing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=36.72s)]
*  But I was also thinking about the victims [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=40.84s)]
*  who were in that courtroom. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=43.44s)]
*  I've covered many cases as a reporter of domestic abuse. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=45.58s)]
*  A lot of these victims don't like to go against the people [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=49.8s)]
*  who have attacked them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=54.56s)]
*  They're scared, they're afraid of retribution. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  So that woman is sitting in that courtroom [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=59.4s)]
*  where all of a sudden the man that she believes attacked her [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=61.72s)]
*  is at a side door, disappeared. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=66.4s)]
*  And the next thing you know, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=68.88s)]
*  who knows what happened in that courtroom? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=70.32s)]
*  All hell breaks out, they're looking for him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=72.44s)]
*  I was looking over the criminal complaint. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=74.7s)]
*  And Jessica and I were talking earlier [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  and she was very, very concerned about the standard. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=80.44s)]
*  What we were starting with something like this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=83.52s)]
*  But when you look over this and you see that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=86.28s)]
*  a courtroom deputy in this complaint [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=88.92s)]
*  basically said that this was very unusual in that courtroom, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=92.36s)]
*  in the judge's courtroom. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  They said first, the courtroom deputy [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=98.72s)]
*  had previously heard Judge Dugan direct people [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=101.04s)]
*  not to sit in the jury box [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=103.68s)]
*  because it was exclusively for the jury use. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=105.06s)]
*  However, the defendant was allowed to sit in the jury box. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=108.16s)]
*  Secondly, the judge is then overheard [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  basically telling the defendant and his attorney [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  to go out the side door. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=121.36s)]
*  And the next thing you know, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=123.16s)]
*  ICE agents are being told what's going on. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=124.48s)]
*  They're running after this guy on foot. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=127.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=129.92s)]
*  Something is very fishy here and smelly. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=130.96s)]
*  They chased him down the street. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=134.36s)]
*  They chased him down the street and they got him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=135.44s)]
*  And there's a debate about how he got out [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=137.56s)]
*  and what the judge directed him to do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=139.32s)]
*  I know everybody's worried about the judge, but you know. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=140.16s)]
*  Right, and so what DHS is telling us, it says, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=142.6s)]
*  he has a laundry list of violent criminal charges, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=145.52s)]
*  including strangulation and suffocation, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=147.72s)]
*  battery and domestic abuse. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=149.68s)]
*  We couldn't verify all of that, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  but we could verify three domestic abuse charges, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  infliction of physical pain or injury is what we're told. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=155.84s)]
*  But Greg, the allegation is the judge felt like [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=158.84s)]
*  that's the guy who needed protecting. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I would like to quote Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=162.82000000000002s)]
*  and every self-righteous Democrat. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=165.8s)]
*  No one is above the law. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=167.96s)]
*  And that includes left-wing judges [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  who subvert the law themselves. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=172.36s)]
*  This isn't even about political ideology [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=174.48s)]
*  or even immigration. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=176.44s)]
*  We're seeing judges who clearly lean [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  towards a specific side. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=179.2s)]
*  They're called activist judges, but that's a contradiction. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=181.0s)]
*  Judges are not activists. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=184.44s)]
*  They are judges. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=186.44s)]
*  Maybe this judge has a backstory with this illegal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=187.72s)]
*  Could it be? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=190.83999999999997s)]
*  It's not just the gavel that she's banging Shannon. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  I wanna talk about Frederica Wilson. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=194.56s)]
*  It's hard to take her seriously when she dresses [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=197.56s)]
*  like she's auditioning for the real housewives [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=201.44s)]
*  of the Kentucky Derby. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=204.16s)]
*  They define their, what you're seeing is a lot [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=206.84s)]
*  of these people in power define their positions [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=209.88s)]
*  by their hatred for Trump. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=213.14s)]
*  If he came out against self-harm, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=215.28s)]
*  she would probably punch herself in the face. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=216.96s)]
*  I understand loyal opposition. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=219.12s)]
*  That's your role when you aren't in power. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  But you should have some duty to your constituents [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=223.84s)]
*  to offer them a better path in what you're seeing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=226.48s)]
*  What would you do differently? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=228.96s)]
*  The whole point of this was getting rid of the worst first. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=230.72s)]
*  We have an illegal immigration problem. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  We have a border problem. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=235.68s)]
*  Now we're actually doing something that people voted for. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  This is the adult solution, the worst first. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=240.56s)]
*  What is your solution other than, I don't know, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  trying to stop the process altogether? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=246.36s)]
*  That's my question. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  Is this gonna happen with every single deportation? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Are they just gonna try to hinder what Americans voted for, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=252.68s)]
*  bogging it down and exhausting us with maybe [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=256.24s)]
*  like one case a week, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=258.76000000000005s)]
*  something that they never did with Obama [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  when he deported 2.4 million illegals. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=262.56s)]
*  They're turning an administrative process [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=266.04s)]
*  into a legal one. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=268.88000000000005s)]
*  Imagine a game where a corrupt umpire [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  throws a flag on every play. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=273.32000000000005s)]
*  So the game can't go forward for one reason or another. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=275.66s)]
*  This is what they were doing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, this is what they did [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=279.32000000000005s)]
*  to the first Trump administration. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  They constantly waged lawfare on him. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=282.20000000000005s)]
*  And this is lawfare now specifically pointed [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=285.0s)]
*  at the process that Americans voted for, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  which is to get the illegal aliens out of this country. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=291.96s)]
*  Well, and Greg, to your point about the polls, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  we have Brand New Fox News polling this week [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=297.24s)]
*  that showed that a majority of people do agree [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  and support the president approved, Jessica, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=301.32s)]
*  of what he's doing when it comes to border security. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=303.52s)]
*  I mean, the numbers have gone to a trickle [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=305.4s)]
*  by any objective standard. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=307.67999999999995s)]
*  And they say they do want people out of this country [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=309.17999999999995s)]
*  if they're here illegally. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=311.88s)]
*  A guy who's accused of these things [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=313.28s)]
*  is that who Democrats want to be seen [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=314.68s)]
*  aligning with or defending? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=317.44s)]
*  I think that Democrats and people who have respect [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=319.44s)]
*  for the separation of powers are aligning with the judge, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=323.8s)]
*  not with this guy who was let out the side door [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=328.62s)]
*  and got picked up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=330.88s)]
*  Maybe he deserves to be deported out of here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=331.72s)]
*  He deserves to stay in court. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=333.4s)]
*  And then he deserves to go if he's not supposed to be here. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=334.56s)]
*  And those things are true. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=336.56s)]
*  But yes, in our Fox News polling, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=337.58s)]
*  you see an approval, positive approval for the president [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=339.56s)]
*  on border security, but he's underwater [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=342.68s)]
*  in terms of handling immigration. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=344.52s)]
*  And now that's true across the board on all the major polls. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  We've seen it in Reuters. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=349.0s)]
*  You see it in Quinnipiac. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=349.84s)]
*  You see it in the YouGov poll. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=350.84s)]
*  Americans have only seen three months [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=352.5s)]
*  of what this administration is doing in terms of immigration. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=354.68s)]
*  And they went from approving it 10 plus points [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=358.08s)]
*  to a strong disapproval. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=362.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's because it feels completely lawless. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  And Greg says these are activist judges. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=368.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court, a conservative court [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=370.32s)]
*  that Donald Trump himself was able to pack [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=372.24s)]
*  is not an activist. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=374.0s)]
*  I'm talking about a murder. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=375.12s)]
*  No, I'm talking, but it's about all of them. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=376.08s)]
*  He's gone against the Supreme Court. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=377.68s)]
*  But that, I didn't say that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=379.4s)]
*  He's gone against the Fourth Circuit. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=380.24s)]
*  Fourth Circuit, a Reagan appointee who wrote that decision [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=382.04s)]
*  saying you can't send this latest shipment to Venezuela. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=385.06s)]
*  Now you're talking about this one, a county judge. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=388.4s)]
*  And when Pam Bondi comes out there and says, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=390.52s)]
*  we will come after you and we will prosecute you, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=393.64s)]
*  we will find you, that is meant to have a chilling effect. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=396.08s)]
*  They didn't need to. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=399.44s)]
*  They didn't need to bring in the law. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=400.28s)]
*  What's your solution? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=401.12s)]
*  Again, you cite polls. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=401.96s)]
*  But I apologize. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=403.28s)]
*  Adults have to do the adult job [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=405.4s)]
*  and it's not gonna be popular. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=407.21999999999997s)]
*  You know what the adult job is? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=408.05999999999995s)]
*  First of all, not announcing this on social media, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  having to take it down and then putting it back up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=411.32s)]
*  The adult thing to do would be to have called her in [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=412.88s)]
*  and have her come in and have a conversation about it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=415.28s)]
*  They didn't need to publicly arrest this woman. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=417.84s)]
*  They wanted to make a show. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=420.11999999999995s)]
*  But Juliet, I have the feeling [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=420.96s)]
*  you have something to say about it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=421.79999999999995s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=422.61999999999995s)]
*  They didn't need to make a show of it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=423.46s)]
*  But everything is for the cameras. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=424.29999999999995s)]
*  Somebody whose actual purpose in this world [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=425.67999999999995s)]
*  is to enact justice and sometimes be the sole deciding factor [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=428.64s)]
*  on what justice is, who sits in front of people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=432.22s)]
*  and has their entire lives in her hands [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=435.78000000000003s)]
*  and she can't do something as simple [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=437.98s)]
*  as obey the law herself [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=439.5s)]
*  and we should just hide it under the rug, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=440.82000000000005s)]
*  bring her into a room and pat her on the hand [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  for putting a guy back out on the street [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=445.02000000000004s)]
*  or trying to hide a guy from the proper authorities [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  who punched someone 30 times [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=449.98s)]
*  and then struck a woman trying to break it up. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=451.78000000000003s)]
*  With all due respect, this whole argument [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=453.98s)]
*  about these Venezuelan gang members [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=455.86s)]
*  or people who say they aren't in a gang [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=458.26000000000005s)]
*  but they've got MS-13 and code on their knuckles. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=459.66s)]
*  To say that, well, whatever it is, okay. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=462.42s)]
*  Well, not everybody. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=464.94s)]
*  We've also sat here and argued against using tattoos [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=465.78000000000003s)]
*  to say if someone's a member of MS-13. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=469.44s)]
*  So anyone who has a tie to MS-13 [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=471.66s)]
*  or the government suspects of it, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=474.14000000000004s)]
*  if you tell me that they deserve due process, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=475.74s)]
*  I'll tell you that I know Lake and Riley's dad [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=478.32000000000005s)]
*  and I would go out and kick every one of them [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=480.62s)]
*  out of this country just because of Lake and Riley. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=482.42s)]
*  So when Frederica Wilson said something like [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=485.38s)]
*  more people are getting rolled up [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=488.26s)]
*  because of Lake and Riley, you're damn right they are [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=489.62s)]
*  because this whole country saw what happened [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=491.9s)]
*  to Lake and Riley and we said, hell no. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=493.58s)]
*  And then that act was passed by Congress that we voted in [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=496.58s)]
*  and signed into law by president that we voted in. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=499.62s)]
*  And if not being for due process for illegal immigrants [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=503.1s)]
*  to come here and commit crime makes me a bad American, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=505.94s)]
*  okay, well, at least I'm still American [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=509.1s)]
*  and that's a hell of a lot more than they are. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=510.66s)]
*  But conservative juggernauts like Antonin Scalia [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=512.46s)]
*  have spoken about the fact that people who are here [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=517.06s)]
*  undocumented deserve due process. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=519.46s)]
*  They can have their intellectual arguments. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=521.78s)]
*  I live in the real world where people get hurt, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=523.3s)]
*  where my sister gets a head-on collision [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=525.22s)]
*  from a drunk illegal who was brought here by a coyote [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=526.78s)]
*  that the Biden administration was happy letting operate. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=530.9399999999999s)]
*  I live in the real world. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=534.62s)]
*  I don't live in New York, I don't live in D.C., [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=535.46s)]
*  I don't live by the Supreme Court. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=536.8199999999999s)]
*  I live in Northwest Georgia. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=538.16s)]
*  I live in a town that 78% of Spanish. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=539.6999999999999s)]
*  So we're not a nation of laws anymore? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=541.54s)]
*  Abraygo. Absolutely we're not a nation of laws. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=542.62s)]
*  Abraygo had due process. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=543.9399999999999s)]
*  That's why all those people are here. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=545.18s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=546.74s)]
*  Yes, see, the problem here is that you say due process [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=547.58s)]
*  and we're all supposed to go, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=551.34s)]
*  ooh, that must mean some kind of court. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=552.1800000000001s)]
*  No, it's not a court, it's an administrative action. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=554.58s)]
*  The guy was told what two judges said he was an illegal. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=557.34s)]
*  Well, somebody tells me he's gonna get- [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=560.7800000000001s)]
*  He was not allowed to be deported to El Salvador. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=561.9000000000001s)]
*  And somebody tells me he's gonna have [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=564.38s)]
*  some version of due process and it's also gonna involve him [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=565.98s)]
*  not residing in this country. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadasR8deIg&t=568.5s)]
