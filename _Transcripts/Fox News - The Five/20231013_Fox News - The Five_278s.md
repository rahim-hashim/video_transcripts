# Martha MacCallum: Why such reluctance to refreeze $6B Iran funds?
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q)
*  brand new fears. Iran backed Hezbollah will open a new front from the north in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's war on terrorism. Israeli forces clashing with Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=6.72s)]
*  today as the radical mullahs of Iran refused to back down following this [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=11.16s)]
*  warning from Joe Biden. We moved the U. S carrier fleet to the eastern [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=16.04s)]
*  Mediterranean or sending more fighter jets there in that region and made it [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=21.1s)]
*  clear, made it clear to the Iranians. Be careful. So Martha, even if the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=25.62s)]
*  administration won't talk much about it, Iran is key to this whole thing. It's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=33.78s)]
*  interesting. Bob Gates was on America's reports this morning or America's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  newsroom this morning and he said every president who has extended their hand to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=41.82s)]
*  Iran has had it slapped. And that's exactly what we're watching play out [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=45.540000000000006s)]
*  here because there was an effort with the JCPOA. There was an effort deal [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=50.5s)]
*  five for five hostages plus $6 billion. I I don't understand. I don't think we [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=55.5s)]
*  know the answer yet to why they will not say that Iran is obviously behind [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=60.3s)]
*  this attack. Well, we can't like Jack King. General Jack King said, What are [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=67.3s)]
*  they looking for? Like a signed piece of paper that said, Yes, please go in on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=70.42s)]
*  October 7th. They're not gonna find that. But you know, the general says it's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=73.56s)]
*  obvious that they would never have pulled this off this orchestration [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=77.06s)]
*  without the Iranians. So I think this is a story that we're gonna keep digging [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=81.02s)]
*  into and find out why there is such reluctance to refreeze the money and say [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=84.3s)]
*  that's what you're doing. I said to John Kirby today, if you if they requested [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=89.46s)]
*  he said, Oh, they haven't touched a dime of it over and over and over again. He [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  said that we have. But what if they asked for it? If they asked for tomorrow, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=95.46s)]
*  would you would you deny it and he wouldn't answer it? John Kirby was [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=98.72s)]
*  dancing today on your show. Jesse, why? Why on the Iran question? She just [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  asked. Well, they're dealing with China and Russia who back the Iranians, and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=106.06s)]
*  so they're trying to put together this deal with the Saudis and the Israelis [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=111.5s)]
*  to normalize relations and the other Arab partners. And if Hezbollah comes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=114.98s)]
*  in with rockets from the north, it opens up a two front war and the United [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=119.8s)]
*  States is screwed because the United States is gonna really have to go in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=123.92s)]
*  hard. And Joe Biden doesn't want to touch it. Joe Biden should just bring [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  in Turkey. He should bring in the Egyptians because we pay those [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=131.3s)]
*  countries a lot of money and he should work this out in a deal and he can't do [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=134.2s)]
*  it because he's not smart enough. So he's gonna probably just watch it all [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=138.22s)]
*  happen as the rest of this country watches it all happen. And I don't think [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=142.42s)]
*  it's gonna end well. Yeah, Harold and Judge, you were having a big debate in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=147.14s)]
*  the break. It was a very lovely conversation. It was spirited, recreated [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=150.46s)]
*  in 90 seconds. No, I mean, if we do stand back and watch her, what happens? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=154.94s)]
*  I don't think we should stand back and watch. I just think we need to be [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=159.22s)]
*  mindful of what happens if something else happens. If this happens in the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=161.42s)]
*  north, it's very likely we will find the Israelis. The Israelis have never asked [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=164.82s)]
*  the Americans to be involved militarily, actively involved militarily with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=168.7s)]
*  troops. As you well know, Pete, you're the only one who served at this table. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=172.2s)]
*  I think they might, the likelihood of them asking if that happens on the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=175.14s)]
*  north front increases dramatically. That's the only point I make is we [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=178.98s)]
*  think about what comes next. I agree with the first part of what you said, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=182.26s)]
*  and I agree totally. They should, John Kermit, everybody should say we're [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=185.82s)]
*  freezing the funds. Say that. I understand the dancing on some of the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=188.42s)]
*  other things, but you gotta say you're freezing those funds. Okay, you know, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=192.42s)]
*  when John Kirby danced today, I watched it. We're watching it like a hawk. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  What does that mean, John Kirby? Jonathan, I mean, it's just, it's stupid [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  watching it like a hawk. Look, here, the problem obviously is that if they [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=203.76s)]
*  say Iran was at it behind it, everybody knows they were. Everybody knows Iran [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  backs Hamas and Hezbollah. Then we put ourselves in a footing where we're [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=214.66s)]
*  possibly in a world war. Everybody understands that. So they're being [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=219.3s)]
*  delicate about the language. You know, but the truth is, you know, when Joe [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=222.94s)]
*  Biden comes out and when Austin comes out and says, don't, it reminds me of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=226.58s)]
*  Nancy Reagan when she when she said, just say no to drugs. You know, it just [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=231.66000000000003s)]
*  it doesn't work. All right, and it doesn't show how firm we are. I mean, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  what about this Hamas guy living in Qatar? Why aren't we? Why aren't we [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=241.06s)]
*  sanctioning cutter for that guy over there who's behind Hamas and all of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=244.5s)]
*  this other stuff? I mean, you know, we're like a we're like pushovers and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=248.7s)]
*  we haven't shown any. In a neighborhood where only strength is respected. And [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=253.1s)]
*  that's the problem. Yeah, exactly. For the record, when Nancy Reagan told me [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  to just say no, I did just say yeah, boy, it works on some. Hey, Sean [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq_37wS_e3Q&t=260.98s)]
