# There used to be areas of society not tarnished by politics: Lara Trump
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU)
*  Laura Trump is an animal rescue advocate and strongly pro dog. She joins us. Laura, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=0.0s)]
*  I can't think of a story that is something so grotesque about this and just absolutely awful, but I'll stop and let you [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=6.48s)]
*  assess what you think of it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=12.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's it's so tragic on every front really Tucker this entire situation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  It used to be that we had a few spaces left in our society that were not tarnished by politics and obviously animals [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=20.72s)]
*  Was one of those spaces and unfortunately as you just heard there [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=27.92s)]
*  Thanks to a shelter in no surprise, California [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  That apparently is gone as well and and here are the numbers because it's roughly six million animals a year that find themselves [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=35.68s)]
*  sadly in shelters, um, they all are looking for homes and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Unfortunately, just shy of about a million of those animals are euthanized every year because they can't find homes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=48.94s)]
*  And obviously we know the shelters are overrun [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=55.12s)]
*  So what you have here is a situation where a a group that claims to care about animals is telling us [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=58.32s)]
*  Very happily that they care more about discriminating against people for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=65.12s)]
*  Constitutional rights for their second amendment freedoms than they do about finding good homes [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=70.7s)]
*  For animals and the two are not mutually exclusive. It's not that you can be a responsible legal gun owner or [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=76.16s)]
*  Be a a loving pet parent because you're looking at a great example of that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=83.28s)]
*  I happen to be a strong supporter of the second amendment along with my husband eric [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=87.92s)]
*  We have two dogs that believe me take up more space in our bed at night than even the two of us [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=91.92s)]
*  They're living a great life [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=96.24s)]
*  Um, but the saddest part of this is all of those animals that of course are not going to find a home now [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=97.92s)]
*  because of of people's just complete ignorance and total [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=104.0s)]
*  Intolerance it is so sad to see and quite frankly a really awful commentary on our society as a whole at this point [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  I think well, it's just so unbelievably cruel. And by the way the people I know [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  Who love and understand their dogs best hunt with their dogs. I mean [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  That's right. And I I appreciate you're coming on tonight laura trump and for all you do on behalf of dogs. Thank you [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uppOMEMElU&t=123.84s)]
