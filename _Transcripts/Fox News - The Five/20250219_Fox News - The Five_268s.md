**Fox News - The Five:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ)
*  There's another good reason why liberal late-night is crying one man is pulverizing them in the ratings [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Just snag one of their beloved supermarket checkout line covers [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=7.82s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld's the gracing the latest cover of variety [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=13.44s)]
*  It says quote Gutfeld may be a novel phenomenon to some but to a sizable and growing portion of the Fox News audience [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=17.12s)]
*  He is the man of the moment [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=25.16s)]
*  Like it or not the nasal voice bleep stir [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=27.84s)]
*  Sees no topic is off-limits is leading the pack and expanding his audience [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=31.96s)]
*  I just it just really hurt. I had to read that I know you're the man of the moment [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  All right, you're the man of the moment Greg. What'd you think of this variety cover? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=44.16s)]
*  Uh, I thought I thought it captures me. I thought the story was great [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=48.0s)]
*  Tatiana Siegel wrote it and I thought she she didn't fall into the trap that you see with a lot of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  People who write about Fox which is they concede that it's successful [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=58.84s)]
*  But at the same time they're condescending about it. Yeah, and in this case she just wrote it by the numbers [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  Here's how great Fox is doing. Here's how great the show was doing. She talked about the five talked about my show and she did it [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=69.88s)]
*  Without acting like oh, let's look at these rubes over here [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=77.54s)]
*  She acknowledged the fact that the club the world has changed and Hollywood is behind [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  What does it say about variety to do a nice? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=87.5s)]
*  Cover story on Greg like that is the media landscape changing? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=90.98s)]
*  Well, yes, because again like what I was just saying about Claudia Scheinbaum [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=95.62s)]
*  like you should be for what's going to happen and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=99.7s)]
*  This is happening [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=102.76s)]
*  But one of the things that she says in there is that more women watch than men [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and she said I had to actually do a double take and say is that real and she had to double check and it [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=107.74s)]
*  Is true. Yeah, we get the chicks, you know what it is. It's my sultry. It's so kind of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=111.54s)]
*  Steamy sex appeal. Yeah, I think that is probably cannot deny it America. I thought it was Tyrus sex appeal, but that's okay [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  What do you think about this is pretty nice cover? It's a great cover. I was glad to be part of the story. Congratulations [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=123.9s)]

*  I think the story is a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=133.86s)]
*  Is a larger kind of purpose as well that a different kind of comedy and comedy that I grew up with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=136.22s)]
*  Is back and and can be done [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=142.02s)]
*  So I you do it every night and I said the piece you you make me think you sometimes make me mad [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=144.86s)]
*  You make me laugh and the piece made me proud to call you a friend. So congrats. Mm-hmm [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=150.34s)]

*  We did I sit next to you an hour a day for the last couple years the woman never even asked me what I think [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=170.54s)]
*  Of you. I would have told you you're a jerk, but who cares channeled your thoughts and you channeled my very nice [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=175.86s)]
*  You know what? I think is interesting [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=182.78s)]
*  I think that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  It's not just the fact that you know, you're winning a young audience and that you're winning with women [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=187.06s)]
*  It's kind of like Joe Rogan. It's about authenticity [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=193.58s)]

*  Thank you Harold. I think that the the other part of this is that you have real people on your show [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=204.74s)]
*  Yeah, whereas these other hosts have to get celebrities [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=211.54s)]
*  I mean they kill themselves trying to get celebrities you just get real people and have real conversations and you know [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=214.78s)]
*  You're not afraid to say things that they would never say like talk about, you know trans and DEI [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=222.1s)]
*  I mean for four years you're one of the first people to talk about this stuff [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=228.26s)]
*  So you're authentic and you know, I'm very proud of you. I think it's great and you talked about excrement [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  No one talks about it except somebody's got to cover this this mug got had very many many prominent features [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_WnSDsiKQ&t=237.82s)]
