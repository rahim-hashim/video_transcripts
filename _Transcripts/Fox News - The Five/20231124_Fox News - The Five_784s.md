# 'The Five': Dramatic new footage shows 24 hostages being driven to safety
**Fox News - The Five:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4)
*  Fox News alert dramatic new video showing 24 hostages and Red Cross vans being driven [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=0.0s)]
*  to safety after spending nearly 50 days in captivity by the terrorists known as Hamas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=6.2s)]
*  Among them are 13 Israeli women and children, but no Americans were freed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=12.32s)]
*  Fighting in Gaza, pausing for the first time since the war started way back on October [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=17.12s)]
*  7th. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  And this is for a four-day truce. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  President Biden is reacting for the first time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=24.92s)]
*  From the moment Hamas kidnapped these people, I along with my team have worked around the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=27.96s)]
*  clock to secure the release. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=32.28s)]
*  Teddy bears waiting to greet those children at the hospital are a stark reminder of the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=33.8s)]
*  trauma these children have been through at such a very young age. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=39.48s)]
*  We expect more hostages to be released tomorrow and more the day after and more the day after [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=43.8s)]
*  that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=48.28s)]
*  What are the chances of these troops to be extended by a few days or more? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=49.28s)]
*  I think the chances are real. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  I don't trust Hamas to do anything right. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=56.0s)]
*  I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=59.44s)]
*  We're hearing that more hostages could be released tomorrow. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=62.72s)]
*  Jeff Paul is live in southern Israel with more on this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=65.44s)]
*  Jeff? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=69.2s)]
*  Yeah, Joey. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=70.2s)]
*  And on top of the 13 who were released, as you mentioned, we are learning another 13 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=72.88s)]
*  likely to be released tomorrow. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=78.0s)]
*  The Israeli government confirming they do have a list of names and they're in the process [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=79.4s)]
*  of calling all the families of the hostages to let them know exactly who is on that list [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  and who is not. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=88.32s)]
*  It's a bit of a bittersweet though development when you realize there are still more than [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=89.32s)]
*  200 people, according to the Israeli government, who are being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=93.36s)]
*  But today nonetheless was a huge and significant first step. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Now here's what we know about who was released. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  24 people so far being released by Hamas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  13 Israelis, 11 foreign nationals. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  Among the Israelis freed, we know four were kids ages ranging from two years old to nine [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  years old. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=117.48s)]
*  One of those kids, Ohad Munder, actually turned nine years old by being held by Hamas. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=118.48s)]
*  Now three were also mothers and six are elderly women. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=123.56s)]
*  So far the truce between Israel and Hamas appears to be holding, but IDF spokesperson [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  Daniel Helgari says even with the pause in fighting, Israeli forces remain focused on [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  one of their core objectives and that's rooting out Hamas. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=137.6s)]
*  During the days of the pause, the IDF will continue the preparations for the next phases [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=143.12s)]
*  of the war. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=148.52s)]
*  IDF troops are ready and prepared on all the fronts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=149.52s)]
*  Now this was the moment when a convoy of rescue hostages passed by a group of Israelis. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=155.72s)]
*  They were cheering and clapping just knowing some of those people were finally getting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=160.72s)]
*  home. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=164.8s)]
*  It is critical though this ceasefire keeps up to continue that flow. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=165.8s)]
*  With the pause in fighting though, several different aid trucks made their way into Gaza [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=170.44s)]
*  delivering things like fuel and cooking gas. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  We also know that 33 Palestinian prisoners, both women and teenagers, were released from [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=178.92s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=185.48s)]
*  So the next couple days are going to be critical. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=186.6s)]
*  We know again another 13 will be released tomorrow. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=189.0s)]
*  If this truce holds, it looks like more aid will be getting in and the next day after [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=192.2s)]
*  that we'll see the same thing happening. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  We're also learning tonight that the hospital where the kids were taken, Schneider Hospital [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=198.44s)]
*  here in Israel, they're reporting that the kids appear to be in good condition. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=202.96s)]
*  Joey? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  Thanks Jeff. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=211.16s)]
*  And as we pray for the safe return of all the hostages, the liberal media is once again [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=212.16s)]
*  making an absolute fool out of themselves over this very topic. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=217.48s)]
*  Take a look at this Israeli spokesman's stunned reaction over a bizarre question about the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=221.32s)]
*  hostage deal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=226.0s)]
*  I was speaking to a hostage negotiator this morning. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=227.92s)]
*  He made the comparison between the 50 hostages that Hamas has promised to release as opposed [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=230.4s)]
*  to the 150 prisoners that are Palestinians that Israel has said that it will release. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=238.76s)]
*  And he made the comparison between the numbers and the fact that does Israel not think that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=244.72s)]
*  Palestinian lives are valued as highly as Israeli lives? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=249.84s)]
*  That is an astonishing accusation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=255.82s)]
*  If we could release one prisoner for every one hostage, we would obviously do that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=258.58s)]
*  We are operating in horrific circumstances. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=263.54s)]
*  Yeah, that look really says it all. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=266.18s)]
*  And if that wasn't crazy enough, anti-Israel protesters were going to glue their hands [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=268.46s)]
*  to the ground today and trying to disrupt the Macy's Thanksgiving parade yesterday. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=272.53999999999996s)]
*  There were more protests happening today, including these folks who shouted at President [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=277.9s)]
*  Biden while he was in Nantucket. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  Free Palestine! [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=284.58s)]
*  Free Palestine! [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=288.02s)]
*  Free Palestine! [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=292.02s)]
*  Free Palestine! [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=296.02s)]
*  Katie, I'm going to, with this idea of them chanting free Palestine, I was on 7th Street [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=300.02s)]
*  yesterday and a big group came down behind me. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=305.18s)]
*  But let's take it back to the tactical side of this because we have two wars happening [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=307.29999999999995s)]
*  at once. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=310.41999999999996s)]
*  We have a war and we have a propaganda or information war. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=312.26s)]
*  And, you know, I've gone back and forth a lot of conversations on this, but what do [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=314.26s)]
*  you think this release that Hamas was willing to come to the table, I mean, their most valuable [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=317.42s)]
*  asset are these hostages? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=321.82s)]
*  What does this mean tactically and with the information war that they're willing to release [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=325.18s)]
*  hostages? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=329.42s)]
*  Well, first I would say to those who are still screaming free Palestine, you've had a ceasefire [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=330.42s)]
*  now so that was supposed to be something that was a negotiation piece and they're still [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=334.3s)]
*  which proves that they don't want Israel to exist at all. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=338.36s)]
*  But clearly the reason we're here with the ceasefire and the release of hostages is not [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  because of just diplomatic negotiations that are happening in Qatar where the Iranian Prime [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  Minister was visiting either yesterday or the day before. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=350.02000000000004s)]
*  It's because of Israel's military action in the Gaza Strip to pressure them to come to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=353.18s)]
*  the table. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=357.68s)]
*  Now, we don't know where all these hostages are. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=358.68s)]
*  Hamas says that they are trying to locate them within the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=360.8s)]
*  We know that some Palestinian Gaza residents took some of them hostage to keep them for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=364.28s)]
*  payment. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=369.79999999999995s)]
*  Other groups like Islamic Jihad also had some of these hostages so locating where they are [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=371.11999999999995s)]
*  is very difficult. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=375.64s)]
*  But it really does contrast in terms of the numbers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=377.11999999999995s)]
*  50 Israeli hostages for 150 Palestinian terrorists. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  These are not people who were taken from their homes and slaughtered or taken hostage from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=385.02s)]
*  a music festival. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  These are people who attempted to kill Israeli soldiers, who attempted to kill Israeli citizens [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=391.0s)]
*  and they are now being equated as the same thing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=395.94s)]
*  They are not. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=399.24s)]
*  Finally, I would say Hamas is still continuing the psychological warfare. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=400.24s)]
*  They returned a woman today who they claimed was dead so her family believed for many, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=404.66s)]
*  many weeks that she was not around. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=409.84s)]
*  Thank God she was returned. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=412.08s)]
*  But they know what they're doing in terms of psychological warfare. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=413.36s)]
*  Again, this is a group that is holding babies hostages and we hear a lot about war crimes [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=416.2s)]
*  and international law. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=421.96s)]
*  That is one of the violations and maybe people should focus on that a little more than what [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=423.58s)]
*  Israel is doing. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=427.5s)]
*  Jimmy, back to that very odd interview on Sky News where somehow they tried to say that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=428.5s)]
*  I guess an Israeli life is worth more. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=434.28s)]
*  I didn't really understand even what she was trying to say but ultimately you got basically [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  one hostage for every three prisoners. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=439.56s)]
*  These are completely innocent life versus three people who have committed crimes and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  been convicted. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=445.0s)]
*  Plus, they stopped aerial surveillance. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=446.0s)]
*  They had to stop their assault. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=448.16s)]
*  Hamas is going to rebuild or at least try to regain some footing about themselves. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=449.8s)]
*  They're so scattered that Israel get a good deal. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=454.6s)]
*  Do you think they were pressured to do it? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=456.84s)]
*  I think there was a lot of pressure to do this but I think what's so frustrating is [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=458.6s)]
*  they tried to frame them as moral equals in that Israel chooses to do business in this [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=462.24s)]
*  fashion. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=467.32s)]
*  Israel is in an impossible situation right now. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=468.32s)]
*  They're not trading, as Katie said, good people for good people. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=470.8s)]
*  One side are civilians that were taken hostage against their will. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=475.08s)]
*  One side is a bunch of thugs and murderers. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=478.32s)]
*  But they've gotten used to getting their way when it comes to these hostage exchanges. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=480.64s)]
*  We did a hostage exchange with Iran where we sent over billions of dollars and we sent [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=484.16s)]
*  over more people than we got back. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=487.64s)]
*  That's always been the status quo because we value life more than they do. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=489.8s)]
*  That's what makes it so frustrating is when they try to establish a moral equivalency, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=495.08000000000004s)]
*  you realize there is none. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=499.1s)]
*  One side is willing to kill babies. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  One side is willing to paraglide into a rave and kill innocent civilians. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  The other side is going out of its way to avoid those casualties. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=505.44s)]
*  Tulsi, if there is any pressure coming to Israel, you have to believe some of it might [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=507.90000000000003s)]
*  be from the Biden administration, which I will go on a limb and say the Biden administration [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=512.7s)]
*  should be trying to get Americans home. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=516.58s)]
*  That should be a priority. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=518.46s)]
*  I want to play a quick clip here from President Biden on what he thinks is the catalyst for [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=519.46s)]
*  all of this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=523.78s)]
*  I cannot prove what I'm about to say. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=525.94s)]
*  But I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when they did was they knew that I [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=528.5s)]
*  was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region to bring peace to the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=533.18s)]
*  region by having recognition of Israel and Israel's right to exist. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=539.22s)]
*  There's overwhelming interest and I think most Arab nations know it and coordinating [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=543.8199999999999s)]
*  with one another to change the dynamic in their region for a longer term peace. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=548.86s)]
*  And that is what I'm going to continue to work on. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=554.34s)]
*  I want to note an Israeli spokesperson basically backed that up and did give him some credit. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=557.3s)]
*  But if I look at the previous administration, you've got Abraham Accords moving the embassy [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=561.22s)]
*  to Jerusalem, killing a chief lieutenant in the Iranian terrorist army, in my opinion. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=564.46s)]
*  Is this an American posture that drove Hamas to do this or is this more regional? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=571.38s)]
*  Look, I think it's both. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=576.66s)]
*  We have to look at the bigger picture and I don't disagree with what he said. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=578.98s)]
*  And it's clear that what they wanted to accomplish is actually happening. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=582.52s)]
*  That's the terrible thing. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=586.98s)]
*  We talk about different types of warfare that are occurring, the information warfare, the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=589.3s)]
*  psychological operations. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=593.9s)]
*  They're pushing the Saudi Arabia away. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=594.9s)]
*  Completely. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=596.86s)]
*  Those talks have stopped completely and any progress that was being made in that direction [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=598.66s)]
*  has gone away. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=603.42s)]
*  But when you listen to that Sky News reporter and the question that she asked, she's emblematic [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=604.86s)]
*  of this broader issue we're seeing with many so-called reporters who aren't just reporting [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=610.74s)]
*  facts but instead essentially doing Hamas' work for them. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=615.3s)]
*  Hamas' goal is to turn the world against Israel in order to reach their objective goal and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=619.3s)]
*  the goal of other Islamist groups and countries, frankly, which is wipe Israel off the face [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  of the earth. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=628.5s)]
*  They're succeeding in doing that by using these reporters who have become their propagandists [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=629.5s)]
*  and those who are naturally compassionate by nature are hearing this and hearing things [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  that are not representative of the truth and falling for it and turning against Israel [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=640.98s)]
*  and not actually seeing the truth of how Islamist and terrorist groups like Hamas, as you know, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=646.34s)]
*  ISIS and Al-Qaeda and others, they have always used civilians as human shields. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=651.62s)]
*  They have always hidden behind them for this exact reason because they know that the news [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=656.82s)]
*  media, many of them, will throw this propaganda out there without telling the full story about [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=662.0s)]
*  their barbaric tactics and their willingness to sacrifice women and children, innocent [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=667.06s)]
*  civilians to achieve their objective. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=671.9s)]
*  People need to understand the whole truth on this whole war. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=675.6199999999999s)]
*  Part of this whole truth, Doctor, is the fact that these hostages come home and they are [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=679.4599999999999s)]
*  going to be treated well, but at some point Israel has to go in and they have to ask them [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=683.18s)]
*  questions. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=687.66s)]
*  They have to get some information from them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=688.66s)]
*  They have heard conversations and maybe how many people were in this room or that room. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=689.66s)]
*  How difficult is that going to be for those hostages? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=694.42s)]
*  Certainly, one of the biggest disappointments I had today when the president spoke was he [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=696.7s)]
*  still said he has no idea the conditions of the American hostages. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=700.1s)]
*  We don't even have an accurate number of how many Americans are still being held hostage [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=703.82s)]
*  there. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=707.42s)]
*  Yet, as Jimmy pointed out, Israel values life and that is why there is a ceasefire right [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=708.42s)]
*  now and they have decided to put pause on their ground operation knowing that they are [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=713.18s)]
*  prolonging how much longer innocent civilians are still going to be in these tunnels of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=717.14s)]
*  terror. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=722.5s)]
*  And so yes, we are so grateful that some were returned today, but there are still many down [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=723.5s)]
*  there. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=727.82s)]
*  We don't know how they are doing and the emotional and physical aspects and the consequences [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=728.82s)]
*  of being down in these tunnels, they are going to be very long lasting and yes, they are [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=732.38s)]
*  going to have to speak to authorities and they are going to have to recount these traumas. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=736.1s)]
*  As you know, Joey, once you have experienced trauma, that is something that will stick [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=740.58s)]
*  with you for your entire life and they are going to have to recount it over and over [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=744.94s)]
*  again. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=747.98s)]
*  I only hope that what they have learned in servicing veterans here the last 20 years, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=748.98s)]
*  I hope some of that is applied. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=752.6999999999999s)]
*  I hope that nothing else, our sacrifice and work can be helpful in that way. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=753.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, absolutely, but as you know, it is a tough road and there are still Americans [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=758.26s)]
*  and many innocent civilians being kept in these tunnels of terror. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=762.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, we know some of the families are still broken up, so some people that did get released [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=765.8199999999999s)]
*  today have families, members that are hostage. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcxSVECil4&t=769.5s)]
