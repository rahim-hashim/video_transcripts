# ‘The Five’: Dems are STILL on the wrong side of this
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98)
*  Democrats are once again blowing it on another 80-20 issue by sticking up for the rights of illegals to burn down the cities they invaded. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=0.0s)]
*  Prosecutors announcing federal charges against two agitators, one of them is an illegal immigrant for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers during the protests in LA. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=7.84s)]
*  CNN's Data Guy delivering the bad news for the Democrats on how legal migrants side with Trump and the GOP big league. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=18.6s)]
*  Look at that shift, a 40-point shift to the right among immigrant voters. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=27.8s)]
*  Republicans now lead on this issue by eight points over Democrats, more so than any other group that I could find. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=33.8s)]
*  The group of voters who became more hawkish on immigration were in fact immigrants themselves, immigrants who are registered to vote in this country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=41.6s)]
*  Right on cue, Senator John Fetterman, the lone voice of reason, telling his own party the basics. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=50.8s)]
*  Don't burn stuff, don't loot, don't attack cops. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=56.0s)]
*  But AOC's got her earmuffs on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=59.099999999999994s)]
*  You can't defend when people start setting things on fire or they start damaging buildings or going after members of law enforcement. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=62.5s)]
*  That's not free speech. That is not peaceful protests. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=71.16s)]
*  If Senator Fetterman or anybody else is concerned with law and order, we should be looking at one of the most law-breaking agencies and administrations that we've seen in the United States. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=78.0s)]
*  Mr. Brian, the Republican Party very united on the issue of mass deportations, but the Democrats fractured. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=89.5s)]
*  Right now, you have Senator Fetterman basically standing alone as probably the only Democrat who's in office who says, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=96.30000000000001s)]
*  I'm pretty sure we should be against looting and violence, and I don't think the National Guard is the problem. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  And AOC does what she always does. It's always ICE's issue. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=108.6s)]
*  ICE's goal is to get illegal immigrants, especially criminals, out of the country. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=112.0s)]
*  And when they do their job, they get rid of criticized as if they're doing a bad job. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  And for the last time at King Jefferies, they cover their face because they're getting docs. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  They're worried about their families. It's not that they're not proud about doing the job that they're doing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=124.1s)]
*  And you should be asking why the protesters cover their face. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=129.6s)]
*  Davy Nations comes in, Washington Post, good guy, but not known as a big-time Trumper. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=132.5s)]
*  These protesters are deliberately working to create visuals that will help Donald Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=137.6s)]
*  People over and over again, Ro Khanna, condemns the violence, but says that there's no business for the National Guard. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=142.5s)]
*  I just, to me, this is an opportunity for those people like Rahm Emanuel, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  who says he wants to run center-left and logical Democrats to stand up and say, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=153.2s)]
*  we got ourselves in a bad position here because we didn't control the riots early. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=157.9s)]
*  We have to learn from this. America wants law and order. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=161.4s)]
*  Rahm, I saw just recently, Sandra, kind of sided with Gavin. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=164.4s)]
*  That's not good for him. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=168.9s)]
*  Yeah. The Democrats have been on the wrong side of this issue, obviously, going back to the election. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=170.1s)]
*  I remember election night and the first emergence of a trend that we were seeing was the Hispanic voter block in this country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=175.0s)]
*  They spoke very loudly and very clearly about what they wanted to see happen with immigration in this country. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=182.5s)]
*  Those that are here legally now and are U.S. citizens don't like what they see on the streets here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=188.5s)]
*  This isn't what they came here for. They came over in proper channels. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=193.4s)]
*  They did what they had to do. They went through the process. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=197.0s)]
*  They became legal American citizens who can vote and they see this happening on the streets and they said no to it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=199.2s)]
*  We saw that in the election and now we see Democrats who didn't learn a lesson [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=206.4s)]
*  and now are still not listening to law abiding citizens in this country who say they don't want to see this happening. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=210.2s)]
*  I was digging up AOC's words on all of this, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Because she's kind of throwing it back. You just heard her there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=219.0s)]
*  She's just throwing it back. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=221.2s)]
*  Well, you should be looking at one of the most law breaking agencies and administration we've seen in the U.S. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=222.5s)]
*  Anybody who's looking at these videos doesn't think, oh, Trump did this, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  Nobody is looking at that and thinking that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=231.7s)]
*  And so it's just a matter of Democrats just not getting it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=234.0s)]
*  And I think that's what we continue to see and we'll put them in trouble again for the midterms. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=238.5s)]
*  How do you think your party's handling this, Jessica? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=242.9s)]
*  80 percent. Great. I think. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=247.8s)]
*  I think it's important that everyone, maybe not AOC, but Gavin Newsom, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=250.3s)]
*  Mayor Bass, who's in charge, is leading with you can't be violent and we're going to prosecute you if you are. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=255.9s)]
*  That that was the lesson of 2020 and it's an important one. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=262.0s)]
*  And I hope by tomorrow there'll be a clip of Harry Enton saying what he treated before we came on here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=265.6s)]
*  This is definitely one of Trump's worst polls. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=271.9s)]
*  Just horrible across the board. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=273.8s)]
*  Net approval minus 16 points. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=275.3s)]
*  Oof. Opposition to the big, beautiful bill. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=277.5s)]
*  Just bad stuff all around. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=280.1s)]
*  So this narrative that everything is going so well for Donald Trump is not backed up by the reality on the ground. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=282.4s)]
*  I understand the footage. It looks bad. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=288.0s)]
*  I'd be scared to be in the middle of it a hundred percent. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=290.1s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that the American people, including Latinos, who, by the way, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=293.0s)]
*  his approval has completely plummeted with, aren't seeing how mismanaged this immigration system is, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=297.0s)]
*  the way that Trump and co are doing it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=303.1s)]
*  Sixty three percent say that illegals should gather court hearing before being deported to Kilmer or Bayer Garcia. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=305.2s)]
*  Fifty seven percent say that he's not being careful in carrying out deportations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=311.3s)]
*  Fifty two percent that he's going too far. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=315.5s)]
*  And 58 percent oppose deporting people with no criminal records. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=317.5s)]
*  And Brian said, well, this is what they were sent there to do. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=321.0s)]
*  Get the people out with criminal records. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  Seventy percent of people who have been taken into custody have not been convicted of anything. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  That is directly flying in opposition of what they said that they were going to do. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=329.79999999999995s)]
*  How are you? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  113 around the criminal records. 113 over the last two days. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  But thousands have been deported. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=337.29999999999995s)]
*  People are in foreign gulags without criminal records. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=339.0s)]
*  Three days in Los Angeles. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=341.5s)]
*  All right. Well, Jessica, when you break into the country, you're going to get kicked out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=345.4s)]
*  The American public don't want it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=346.4s)]
*  Okay. Well, the American public. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=349.2s)]
*  Who's going to do your manicure, Chasie? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=350.7s)]
*  I don't get manicures. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=351.7s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=352.9s)]
*  I see your nails every day. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=353.9s)]
*  I cut them very well. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=354.9s)]
*  I mean, is that bad? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=356.4s)]
*  You want me to come in here with fangs? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=357.5s)]
*  You do that cuticle work? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=359.2s)]
*  What? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=360.2s)]
*  You do that cuticle work yourself? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=360.7s)]
*  Cuticle work? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=362.2s)]
*  I have beautiful cuticles and all I just use is one of these little scissors. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=362.9s)]
*  I'm very dexterous. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=366.7s)]
*  How do you know what a cuticle is, Brett? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=368.2s)]
*  Ask me. I ask you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  A cuticle is the part of the nail that meets the skin. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=370.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=374.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm not a moron, Jessica, despite what I sound like. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  If they want to change the immigration laws in this country, they can have Congress do that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=379.7s)]
*  Don't complain when they're just getting enforced. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=384.2s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=386.7s)]
*  I mean, look, these are the duly appointed laws that we have. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=387.4s)]
*  They haven't changed them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  ICE is there to enforce them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=391.2s)]
*  That's kind of it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=392.8s)]
*  And what people don't realize with this stuff here, what's happened to the Democrats, is that, look, I've been out on this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=394.2s)]
*  In 2020, a lot of the same characters were throwing bricks at my people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=399.3s)]
*  There is an ecosystem that has grown up over the last seven, eight years, let's call it, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=403.2s)]
*  Whereas in the past, maybe going back a little further, this sort of anarchist crew, they weren't that organized. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  They weren't that well-funded. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a7m9-r_a98&t=415.4s)]
