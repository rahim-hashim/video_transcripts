# Jesse Watters: Trump is not phased by this
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY)
*  He just loves this s***. That's a quote. Talking deals with the most powerful people in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=0.0s)]
*  world when he's got all the cards and leverage is like air for him. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=11.6s)]
*  President Trump's loving is terrified against the world. The apex negotiator giving himself [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=17.76s)]
*  90 days to cut highly tailored deals for America while choking out China. The commie is slapping [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=22.28s)]
*  us with 125% tariff but they won't go any higher. Xi also thinks Trump's gonna crack by slapping [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=28.22s)]
*  around liberal Hollywood. Beijing is threatening to moderately reduce the number of US films [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=35.74s)]
*  allowed into the country but Trump's not fazed by the Chinese not getting to see Snow White. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=40.739999999999995s)]
*  What's your reaction to them now targeting cultural exports from the United States? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=45.26s)]
*  I think I've heard of worse things. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=51.58s)]
*  How close are you to the first country coming to actually make a deal with the United States [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=54.18s)]
*  over tariffs? Is it days, months? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=58.58s)]
*  Well I think it's very close but you know we have to have a deal that we like. We don't [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=60.34s)]
*  want a deal that's gonna be a bad deal or I could make every deal in one day if I wanted [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=63.66s)]
*  to. I could do this in all in one day. I could just say here's what we'll do. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=68.62s)]
*  Mr. Wonderful thinks it's about time someone took the fight to China. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=73.5s)]
*  I don't care if it's a thousand percent tariffs. They have to come to the table now and not [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=78.5s)]
*  just settle this trade war. They need to settle all of this unbalanced situation. They cheat, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=83.34s)]
*  they steal, they don't play by the rules and I've had enough. So I would like this thing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=91.1s)]
*  worked out. I don't care about the volatility. I don't care if Trump ratchets it up 25 percent [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=95.62s)]
*  a day. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=100.22s)]
*  What do you mean you don't care about volatility if volatility has a direct impact on us as [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=100.62s)]
*  consumers? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=106.66s)]
*  Because we have to fix this problem once and for all. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=108.46s)]
*  We leave it to CNN to act like a bunch of elitist snobs mocking the working man for [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=110.98s)]
*  getting shafted by terrible trade deals. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  On behalf of the forgotten working class of this country. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=118.14s)]
*  Will we please stop this forgotten working class? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=121.98s)]
*  We will not sir. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  We will not sir. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you all nonsense. Everybody in some shape or form is part of a working class either [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  historically, today or whatever and every one of us in some shape or form lives in an [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=134.02s)]
*  economic environment where we are aware of what is happening in our own areas. But this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=139.9s)]
*  idea that somehow it's Wall Street versus Main Street and Main Street doesn't care about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=145.94000000000003s)]
*  Wall Street and Wall Street just wants. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  All right, Brian Kilmeade, who was that guy? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=153.22000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. He looks so familiar. One minute he's an expert walking in the park. The next [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=156.38000000000002s)]
*  minute he's an expert at air travel. I'm not sure what he's doing, but he's yelling at [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=161.38000000000002s)]
*  the wrong person. Batya wrote a book about working class America a year and a half ago. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=166.34s)]
*  So she said that she got to get ahead of this. And Scott Besson, who did my radio show when [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  he was just a thought about Treasury Secretary, said my biggest, I asked what his biggest [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  worry. And he said income disparity. I said, why? He goes, there's not enough money for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=179.58s)]
*  working class people. And that he goes, and I say there's a guy that has done very well [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=183.98000000000002s)]
*  for myself. You know, he came in, had very little, was able to work his way up, worked [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=188.3s)]
*  But George Soros and minutes to be Treasury Secretary to give Ø¨ack. So I'm fascinated by [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=192.7s)]
*  this match up. And right now, in so many ways, I feel like this is back to the pandemic in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=196.78s)]
*  that we had to go study China. They started this pandemic. What's going on here. And then [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=201.66s)]
*  we're trying to look at their economy. And so much of this has a house of cards, though [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=205.94s)]
*  young people are not working over there. They got huge problems with housing. They got empty [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  cities. Nobody. Nobody has any opportunity. They live to export. If they can export, they [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=213.66s)]
*  act as tough as they want. They'll begin to collapse. This guy's going to feel the pressure [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=219.3s)]
*  quickly and Trump knows it. Joe Biden probably could have done this when he was president. You [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=222.9s)]
*  had the whole world against China after they unleashed this virus and he just sat on his hands, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  Katie. Well, I think he did more than that or less than that you could say. Yeah, China has never [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=233.94s)]
*  been held responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, killing millions of people all around the world, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=240.5s)]
*  sending false and fake PPE all over the world, fake testing kits when they claimed that they [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=246.34s)]
*  were delivering humanitarian aid to countries in Europe. But this current trade war, the president [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=251.22s)]
*  has leverage here because he has isolated China. Now the world has a choice. We can either go with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=256.66s)]
*  cheap Chinese goods, which we know are broken and fake and that do not have longevity. And that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=262.98s)]
*  includes things sold at Walmart, but also things built in countries like Africa, where China has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=268.9s)]
*  gone through and promised we'll build you a bridge, we'll build you infrastructure. It all [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=274.18s)]
*  starts crumbling down after the imported Chinese workers to do those jobs. And then they walk away [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=278.98s)]
*  and say, we don't care if your bridge collapsed. We don't care if these things aren't working for [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=283.7s)]
*  you. You still owe us money and you're stuck in this debt trap. The president understands that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=288.1s)]
*  legacies are not built on snapshot polling. Yes, this tariff situation is new. People are not [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  comfortable with it. It's different. It is going to potentially cause some short-term pain, but [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=299.38s)]
*  it's part of a broader economic plan that the president has with tax cuts, deregulation, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=304.82s)]
*  spending cuts. And so they're in this for the long haul and so is China. They have a 100-year plan. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=310.1s)]
*  And if China wants to go with looking at the rest of the world and saying, take our exports versus [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=316.1s)]
*  the United States, I think the world is going to say your credibility in terms of the goods that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=322.34s)]
*  you provide after stealing intellectual property, which is the to tune of $600 billion from American [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=326.26s)]
*  corporations. I think most of the world is going to choose the better or credible country, which is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  the United States. Jessica, China going after Hollywood. Do you think that that was the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=336.74s)]
*  smartest point of leverage to take on Donald Trump? Isn't the art of the deal. That's just an opening [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=342.9s)]
*  gambit, right? We'll ease our way into that. Yeah. I think that China knows that there are [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=348.5s)]
*  tens of millions of Americans that own small businesses that rely on goods from China that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=354.98s)]
*  are going to be completely bankrupted by these tariffs. And that's really what this is about. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=360.26s)]
*  They could say what they want about Hollywood, but that's what it's going to come down to, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  that people need to be able to go to Walmart and get the things that they want. And that's what [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  the CEO of Walmart is saying. That's what people like Ken Langone is saying, calling what Trump's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=373.54s)]
*  doing BS. This is someone who's a strong supporter of his, Ken Griffin as well. I was struck by what [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=378.42s)]
*  Larry Fink said this morning on CNBC. This is the head of BlackRock. The U.S. post-World War II was [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=385.14000000000004s)]
*  a global stabilizer. We are now a global destabilizer. Yes, I do believe we're probably [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=391.70000000000005s)]
*  starting, if not already in a recession. This is not a pandemic. This is not a financial crisis. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=396.74s)]
*  This is something we've created. And that's the trend line here, that smart people who create jobs, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=401.94s)]
*  who are really rich, who have done well, who Donald Trump respects, know that what he's doing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=408.26s)]
*  is about his own fantasies and not about the realities of the economics here. The dollar [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=415.38s)]
*  is weakening. People are dumping U.S. assets. They don't think that we're a good bet. And the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=420.98s)]
*  American public, the lower classes that Scott Besson is so concerned with, are losing their minds. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=426.02s)]
*  Consumer sentiment dropped to its second lowest level since 1952 when they started recording this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=432.42s)]
*  Do you think that's a good thing, that the American public who need to be able to get up [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=439.22s)]
*  and go to the grocery store and get that flat-screen TV, if that's what they want? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=443.3s)]
*  Do you think the last 40 years of trade have been good? Yeah, they have been good. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=447.62s)]
*  For the middle class. Hadn't we? They've been good for the middle class, Jessica. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=452.42s)]
*  If you're talking specifically about protectionists, policies about auto manufacturers. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=455.54s)]
*  I'm talking about jobs and factories and honor in the Rust Belt and across the country. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=459.14s)]
*  What's more important than, Jesse, why are there tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs available [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=464.26s)]
*  because people don't want them? That's what folks who are smart about this are saying. We can't have [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  a manufacturing economy. We don't have the workers for it. We don't have the interest in it. She's [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=475.46s)]
*  talking about a different type of manufacturing. We're not talking about t-shirts. I'm not. We're [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=479.46s)]
*  talking about aerospace. We're talking about steel. We're talking about automobiles. We're talking [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=482.9s)]
*  about robotics and AI. Those are the types of high-tech jobs the president's looking to return. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=487.46s)]
*  I also think that the arguments over volatility or the arguments over the small business reliance [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=492.97999999999996s)]
*  on certain things, it's very short-term. It's very myopic. It reminds me of someone's breaking up with [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=498.34s)]
*  a violent, controlling partner. It's like, well, but all your friends are through me. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=505.38s)]
*  It's a dependence that's based on a total fallacy of trust. The reality is that in the last 40 [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  years, our deficit to China is not only at times in the trillions but up to the billions in terms [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=517.14s)]
*  of the trade goods deficit. But we also, when we had to bail out American workers, for example, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=523.22s)]
*  to the tune of $27 billion, $26 billion of that was tethered even to China. Us bailing out our [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=528.26s)]
*  farmers because of our dependence on China still required a dependence on China. Everything that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  we do has been absolutely tethered to this country that has such a lopsided power differential. Finally, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=541.86s)]
*  we are reclaiming. The extrication of a system that has had us under its heel for the last 40 [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=547.78s)]
*  years as we have created a system where we rely on cheap faulty goods that are destroyed, that we've [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=553.14s)]
*  fed into this consumerism, fast casual lifestyle, it's okay to put that on pause while the extrication [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=558.58s)]
*  has a bit of growing pains for the long-term self-independence so that we don't have to have [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=564.34s)]
*  such a lopsided existence. I don't buy that the status quo, because it was, is somehow the reason [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=571.38s)]
*  why it should remain. And I note too that despite the confidence in the stock market at this moment, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=577.38s)]
*  I think there's a greater appreciation for the short-term value of it because the number one [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=582.66s)]
*  cabinet member currently of the Trump administration that has consumer confidence, that has voters [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=586.82s)]
*  confidence, is Treasury Secretary Scott Besant. And so I think to that point, people know that [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=592.26s)]
*  they're making a good decision that might hurt for a short amount of time, but in the long run, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=597.86s)]
*  it will be so much more valuable to be untethered from China. And to see these deals get better and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=602.74s)]
*  better, you're going to have Israel, you're going to have South Korea, Japan is going to be first, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=607.3000000000001s)]
*  Italy's coming on Wednesday, El Salvador is something unrelated on Monday. But little by [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=611.0600000000001s)]
*  little, all these deals, you're going to be hearing the positive news about other reconfigurations of [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=616.5s)]
*  our trade deal. All these deals are going to be better, marginally better or much better. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=620.74s)]
*  The EU is going to be fascinated. I don't know why you think that's going to be the case. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=624.66s)]
*  He says now, Trump says that we have raw deals with Canada and Mexico. He negotiated the USMCA [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=628.1s)]
*  himself. He does not have a good track record. So you're talking about the USMCA. I'm not sure [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=633.4599999999999s)]
*  what Canada's doing. I just think- Well, Joe Biden did no trade deals. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=636.5799999999999s)]
*  That's not true. First of all, that's absolutely not true. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=639.14s)]
*  That is true. There were no trade deals under the Biden administration. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=641.86s)]
*  I don't even think trade deals have moved markets or goods. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=645.38s)]
*  Australia doesn't even take our beef. We lost four million jobs because of China. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=647.4599999999999s)]
*  Because of how much hormones we have pumped into the state. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  You ate the same beef. You don't go to a restaurant just to get and say, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=652.4200000000001s)]
*  I'll have the hormone free beef. If it was an option, I would pay up for it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=656.58s)]
*  You order it off the menu and you look great, by the way. See what I did? See what I did. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=659.14s)]
*  That's true. Two babies look like this. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=663.94s)]
*  I have hormone replacement beef. Does that taste better? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOUFOprAhY&t=666.02s)]
