# 'The Five': Alcatraz may be back in business
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU)
*  Welcome to the Rock. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=0.0s)]
*  Alcatraz won the stuff of Hollywood movies like The Rock maybe back in business. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=5.34s)]
*  President Trump is seriously floating the idea of reopening the notorious island prison [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=10.18s)]
*  to house America's most violent offenders and even illegal immigrants. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=14.64s)]
*  It's been shut down since the 1960s, but President Trump sees it as a way to combat what he calls [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  radicalized judges. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=23.16s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=24.92s)]
*  Our country needs law and order. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=26.82s)]
*  Alcatraz is, I would say, the ultimate, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=28.86s)]
*  Alcatraz, Sing Sing, and Alcatraz, the movies. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=32.22s)]
*  But it's right now a museum, believe it or not. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=36.22s)]
*  A lot of people go there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=39.5s)]
*  It housed the most violent criminals in the world, and nobody ever escaped. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=41.38s)]
*  One person almost got there, but they, as you know the story, they found his clothing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=47.44s)]
*  rather badly ripped up, and it was a lot of shark bites. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=52.5s)]
*  We'll see if we can bring it back in large form, add a lot. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=57.42s)]
*  It sort of represents something that's both horrible and beautiful. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=62.26s)]
*  Another game-changing idea, the Trump DHS offering to pay for illegal alien self-deportation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=68.7s)]
*  flights and offer an additional $1,000 stipend to leave. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  Here's the president on that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=77.5s)]
*  We're going to pay each one a certain amount of money, and we're going to get them a beautiful [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=79.5s)]
*  flight back to where they came from, and they have a period of time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=84.58s)]
*  And if they make it, we're going to work with them so that maybe someday, with a little [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=89.34s)]
*  work, they can come back in if they're good people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=93.62s)]
*  If they don't work, and if we take them out after the date, then they're never coming [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=95.98s)]
*  back. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=100.94s)]
*  So I want to go to our San Francisco correspondent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=101.94s)]
*  That would be Greg Guthrie. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=105.14s)]
*  You've been at Alcatraz twice. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=106.14s)]
*  You think you're going to see this? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=107.7s)]
*  Yes, I was there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=108.98s)]
*  You've been there a lifetime? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=109.98s)]
*  I was there by choice. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=110.98s)]
*  It was our grade school and high school field trip. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=113.02s)]
*  I think they wanted to scare us straight, but it was San Francisco. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=115.78s)]
*  Didn't work. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, that came out wrong. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  But you know what he's trying to do? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  I think what Trump's doing is he's trying to paint a grim picture for illegals who think [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  they're going to wait this out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=128.7s)]
*  Is your country really as bad as Alcatraz? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=130.22s)]
*  Maybe instead of seeking asylum here, you might think twice. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=133.54s)]
*  He's trying to undo the perception of the incentives that were put in place that caused [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=136.34s)]
*  this unprecedented invasion. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=140.94s)]
*  So sending them to Alcatraz is kind of a compromise between El Salvador and the Roosevelt Hotel, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=143.14s)]
*  where they're staying at now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=152.38s)]
*  If you pay them a grand, that's two or three days of room and board that they would already [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=153.94s)]
*  get. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=159.22s)]
*  So you're probably saving money by giving them a thousand bucks. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=160.22s)]
*  But what's interesting here is the number one concern that Trump ran on was illegal [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=163.66s)]
*  immigration, and he crushed it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=167.86s)]
*  So the Democrats replaced that with judges. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=170.06s)]
*  So imagine you cross the finish line of a marathon, you break through the tape, and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=172.58s)]
*  they say, sorry, that's not the real finish line. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=177.98s)]
*  It's another 20 miles up there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  That's what the Dems did. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=182.18s)]
*  He solved the actual problem. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=183.46s)]
*  The Dems, they didn't want to build a wall to keep illegals out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  Now they're building a wall to keep them in. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's through legal means, which we know is more administrative than legal. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=191.78s)]
*  I think that I thought that we had agreed on the worst first. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=197.5s)]
*  Didn't we all? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=202.22s)]
*  I know we all agreed on the worst first. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=203.38s)]
*  And then the Democrats decided that their worst is way worse than everybody else's. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=205.86s)]
*  So a Maryland dad, wife beating a human trafficker, didn't qualify as the worst. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=211.46s)]
*  It's like they changed the boarding system. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=216.52s)]
*  Group A was the worst first. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=219.06s)]
*  But no, the wife beating human trafficker, he's in group D. They're going to move him [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=220.9s)]
*  back. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=224.82s)]
*  So it makes no sense. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=225.82s)]
*  It is interesting how the Garcia case sort of went away after the 18th count of domestic [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=227.36s)]
*  violence. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=233.28s)]
*  Then they were like, well, maybe we shouldn't talk about this anymore. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=234.28s)]
*  Judge Jeanine, reopening Alcatraz, I mean, I don't think it's going to happen in my lifetime. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  But like, for example, you have to truck or you have to ship everything in. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  And then you also have to pull all of the sewage out because there's no way to do it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  When I was a judge, I used to send prisoners to sing sing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=253.24s)]
*  If I could have sent them to Alcatraz, it would have been great because I came across [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=256.68s)]
*  some that absolutely deserve to be there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=260.64s)]
*  Donald Trump made it very clear it wasn't just for illegals. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=263.08s)]
*  He talked about domestic terrorists, cartel bosses, serial killers, Americans. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=266.48s)]
*  Let me tell you, I think the island location, the cold water, the shark infested water, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=271.56s)]
*  the isolation it represents, the fact that this is something that you don't want to go [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  to as a defendant. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  You don't want to be sentenced there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=285.24s)]
*  I know it's going to cost money. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=286.88s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=288.36s)]
*  But it's a maximum security location. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=289.36s)]
*  You're not going to get visits by your family. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=292.52s)]
*  They're not going to fly out there, get on a boat and go to Alcatraz. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=295.0s)]
*  This is the worst thing you can do for a criminal defendant in the United States in terms of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=298.72s)]
*  sentencing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=303.92s)]
*  And I think it's great. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=304.92s)]
*  I think we need a super max like this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=305.92s)]
*  We don't have anything like El Salvador. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  And if the goal is to house the worst of the worst, he's got it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=310.92s)]
*  We've got jail overcrowding in California. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  We need more room. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  So that's one of the reasons, the historical continuity of this thing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=320.0s)]
*  And there's surveillance technology that we can now utilize with drone surveillance and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  anti-tunneling that we've got down because of what's going on in Gaza. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  We figure that out. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=333.24s)]
*  I think that this is a symbolic deterrent and it's legendary. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=335.0s)]
*  And in the end, I think that when it's only reachable by boat and helicopter, they're [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=340.16s)]
*  going to understand. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=345.48s)]
*  There's no conjugal visits here, boys. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=346.92s)]
*  Your girlfriend ain't showing up. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  I wish, Harold, that President Trump would try to keep Rikers open. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  Because when they close that, there's not going to be enough places to put all the criminals [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=356.44000000000005s)]
*  in New York. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=359.8s)]
*  Well, it's good to be back around and tell you, I hope everybody had a good week. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=360.8s)]
*  And I'd ask a couple things. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=363.48s)]
*  And I frame the way I think about all of this in the context of Doge and other government [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  efficiency. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=369.48s)]
*  One, do we have a need for more maximum security prisons? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=370.48s)]
*  I don't know the answer. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=374.72s)]
*  We may. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=375.72s)]
*  And based on some of the things that you've said, Judge, today and other instances, we [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=376.72s)]
*  probably do. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=379.8s)]
*  We certainly may have a need here in New York. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=380.8s)]
*  Two, what would be the most efficient location and the most efficient building costs for [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=382.6s)]
*  that? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=387.6s)]
*  I would hope that we would apply that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=388.6s)]
*  I think that's what Mr. Musk and his team would want. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=389.76s)]
*  In light of all of that, it just strikes me as hard to believe that Alcatraz, which for [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=392.48s)]
*  those who have seen it, it's a beautiful piece of real estate. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=397.56s)]
*  It has a weird history and a tortured history. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=399.88s)]
*  Al Capone was there. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=402.88s)]
*  It was closed in 1963 by, of all people, Robert F. Kennedy when he was the attorney general. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=403.88s)]
*  You look at it there, and if you've been to San Francisco and you've been there before, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  you know what you're dealing with here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=413.08000000000004s)]
*  There's no doubt it has some security apparatus to it that's interesting. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=414.56s)]
*  But the reason they closed it, they didn't touch on it at the outset because of cost. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=417.66s)]
*  So if costs are an issue, it would seem to me that one of the things you're doing with [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=421.36s)]
*  or people who commit these heinous crimes, be they citizens or not, is you don't want [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  to reward them by sending them to the prettiest piece, one of the prettiest pieces of real [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  estate in the country and where it's so expensive for taxpayers. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=432.9s)]
*  But that's just me. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=436.32s)]
*  When it comes to what the president's doing on self-deportation, I support him 100 percent. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=437.4s)]
*  I hope that a thousand is enough. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=440.84s)]
*  I think he's even wondering himself if a thousand dollars and a coach class ticket is going [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  to get people to self-deport. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=446.08s)]
*  You give them a thousand, they're probably sure with 960 because they got about $40 with [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=447.79999999999995s)]
*  the stuff on the plane. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=450.64s)]
*  It's like at the airport when they're like, we're looking for 15 volunteers. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=451.64s)]
*  That is $1,200. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=454.88s)]
*  I give him, I think what Greg said at best, I think we may not agree on all the details [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=455.88s)]
*  the way Greg described, but he's right in terms of this is a paradigm to undo the incentives [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=460.68s)]
*  to come to the country that were readily and abundantly apparent back before President [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=464.44s)]
*  Trump became president. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  Hopefully this works. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  If it doesn't, hopefully he tries something different. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=471.47999999999996s)]
*  I said I'm always for trying bold things to get bold outcomes and deportations of criminals [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=473.24s)]
*  and the worst first. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  It has to be foremost in the president's mind as it has been now for the first 112, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=480.04s)]
*  105, or 106 days. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=484.0s)]
*  I think one of the things Jesse on the self-deportation that is helpful and that he said it and he [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  made the stronger point and I think they need to emphasize this is that if you take us up [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=491.16s)]
*  on this and you do the right thing and you go back, then you could have a legal path [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=495.12s)]
*  to get back here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=499.44s)]
*  So that mightn't be the incentive. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  That's just a trick Dana. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=502.56s)]
*  We're just telling them that. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=503.56s)]
*  I'm like, hey, you're off message. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=504.56s)]
*  What is the message anyway? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  The message is Trump forces everybody into his frame. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=510.88s)]
*  The Democrats woke up on Monday. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=512.92s)]
*  They didn't want to talk about illegal immigration. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=514.88s)]
*  They had no plans to talk about Alcatraz, but they're talking about Alcatraz and they're [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=516.48s)]
*  defending criminal migrants. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=520.64s)]
*  Please don't send them to prison. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=522.4s)]
*  It's exactly what Trump's trying to do here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=524.4s)]
*  And he looks like a creative problem solver. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=526.68s)]
*  And then what Greg said, you have migrants now thinking, I don't want to come here and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=529.56s)]
*  other migrants who are here saying, now I think I should leave. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=533.6s)]
*  No one has ever escaped except Sean Connery. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=536.96s)]
*  I think though it's true. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=541.44s)]
*  And Sean Hannity. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=542.6s)]
*  Yeah, no, there's Frank Morris and the brothers. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=543.6s)]
*  Frank Morris and the brothers. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=547.1600000000001s)]
*  I thought it was Nick Cage. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  He has a mandate for mass deportations. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=550.0400000000001s)]
*  You cannot let the rule of law become a suicide pact. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  If you have 20 million illegals here, you cannot have 20 million hearings. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=556.64s)]
*  So he has to either invoke more wartime powers acts like he has, or the Supreme Court has [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=561.72s)]
*  to narrow due process because right now it's a disaster. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=566.84s)]
*  The pandemic. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=572.3000000000001s)]
*  What did the courts say? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=573.3000000000001s)]
*  We couldn't even go to church. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  Not that I was going to church, but if I had wanted to go to church, I wasn't allowed to [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=576.5s)]
*  go to church. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=580.24s)]
*  The courts can't step in and say, you guys have to leave the country. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=581.24s)]
*  These are emergency powers that need to be invoked because this is a national emergency. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=584.36s)]
*  We had a demented president who allowed an invasion and the courts never stepped in. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=589.2s)]
*  Now we have a president with a mandate who's trying to stop the invasion and the courts [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=593.48s)]
*  are stepping in to stop the president from stopping an invasion. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=597.48s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=601.96s)]
*  Judge, I've said it a hundred times. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=602.96s)]
*  We need to stop people from going to law school. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=605.7s)]
*  The president needs to sign an executive order. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=608.96s)]
*  People like you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=611.16s)]
*  Jesse, people like you. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=612.16s)]
*  To put a 10-year ban on people going to law school just so we can figure out what the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=613.16s)]
*  heck is going on. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  You know the other option for the president? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  Hire a lawyer. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=619.16s)]
*  Congress pass new laws. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=620.16s)]
*  That's the most effective way. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=621.16s)]
*  Good luck waiting for that, Harold. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=623.28s)]
*  But that's how our society works. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=625.0s)]
*  It's not wrong, but it's unlikely. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8jRvHCOiU&t=626.0s)]
