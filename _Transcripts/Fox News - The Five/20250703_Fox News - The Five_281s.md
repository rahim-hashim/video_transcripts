# ‘The Five’: Biden’s policies are ‘coming undone’
**Fox News - The Five:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY)
*  What if he said he was running, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=0.0s)]
*  Joey? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=2.0s)]
*  Number one, Democrats would [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=3.0s)]
*  probably elect him right now [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=5.0s)]
*  considering what they've been [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=7.0s)]
*  left with. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=8.0s)]
*  They went back to him the last [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=9.0s)]
*  time it worked. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=10.0s)]
*  Listen, I just want to know how [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=11.0s)]
*  much he made for that speech [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=13.0s)]
*  because we know the Obamas and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=14.0s)]
*  even Hillary were making six [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=15.0s)]
*  figures to go give dumb [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=17.0s)]
*  speeches after the fact. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=18.0s)]
*  I want to know, is he making [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=20.0s)]
*  like, what, 20 grand? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=21.0s)]
*  How much does he make? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=22.0s)]
*  He's probably making a ton. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=23.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=24.0s)]
*  I would say I'm a better [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=25.0s)]
*  speaker than he is, and that's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=26.0s)]
*  not even really complimenting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=27.0s)]
*  myself that much. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=28.0s)]
*  I do think that's true. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=29.0s)]
*  Katie, do you think that world [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=30.0s)]
*  leaders, he says they're [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=32.0s)]
*  reaching out to you for advice. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=33.0s)]
*  Do you think that that's true? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=34.0s)]
*  I read this and actually laughed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=35.0s)]
*  out loud. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=37.0s)]
*  I was at NATO following the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=38.0s)]
*  president in the press pool. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=40.0s)]
*  There is no way that anybody of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=42.0s)]
*  significance is calling Joe [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=43.0s)]
*  Biden the guy who Russia invaded [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=45.0s)]
*  Ukraine under. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=47.0s)]
*  Everybody at NATO was trying to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=48.0s)]
*  get meetings with President [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=50.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=51.0s)]
*  They came away with a 5% [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=52.0s)]
*  commitment after barely paying [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=53.0s)]
*  their dues during Trump's first [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=55.0s)]
*  term. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=56.0s)]
*  They were excited about the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=57.0s)]
*  president being back on the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=58.0s)]
*  world stage, not having to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=59.0s)]
*  follow the president around, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=60.0s)]
*  make sure he wasn't getting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=61.0s)]
*  lost. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=62.0s)]
*  Trump was in the middle, he was [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=63.0s)]
*  front and center, he was running [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=64.0s)]
*  the meetings, they were [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=65.0s)]
*  respecting him, they were happy [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=66.0s)]
*  that America was back, and they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=67.0s)]
*  were happy that the president [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=68.0s)]
*  saved the alliance, which is [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=69.0s)]
*  exactly what he did. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=70.0s)]
*  Nobody is calling Joe Biden for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=71.0s)]
*  advice about world affairs, which [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=72.0s)]
*  completely fell apart on every [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=73.0s)]
*  single level under his watch. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=75.0s)]
*  Paul, so he said he was very [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=76.0s)]
*  upset about his accomplishments [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=77.0s)]
*  being undone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=78.0s)]
*  He said he was very upset about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=79.0s)]
*  his accomplishments being [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=80.0s)]
*  undone. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=81.0s)]
*  He said he was very upset about [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=82.0s)]
*  his accomplishments being [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=83.0s)]
*  undone. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=84.0s)]
*  He said he was very upset about [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=85.0s)]
*  his accomplishments being [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=86.0s)]
*  undone. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=87.0s)]
*  My question is, do you think it's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=88.0s)]
*  fair, or how much of it do you [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=89.0s)]
*  think is fair to even call his [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=90.0s)]
*  accomplishments, given what we [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=91.0s)]
*  know now and what many of us [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=92.0s)]
*  suspected for quite some time, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=93.0s)]
*  about his lack of involvement in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=94.0s)]
*  his own administration? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=95.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if his legacy was [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=96.0s)]
*  really being undone, there would [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=97.0s)]
*  be 12 million fewer people in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=98.0s)]
*  this country right now, okay? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=99.0s)]
*  Because that's really his [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=100.0s)]
*  legacy, the fact that we [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=101.0s)]
*  evaporated the southern border [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=102.0s)]
*  and now we have all these [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=103.0s)]
*  problems trying to figure out [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=104.0s)]
*  how to get these people out, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=105.0s)]
*  including the worst, the worst [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=106.0s)]
*  ones, and we're not going to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=107.0s)]
*  get rid of them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=108.0s)]
*  We're going to get rid of them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=109.0s)]
*  We're going to get rid of them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=110.0s)]
*  We're going to get rid of them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=111.0s)]
*  The other thing is this, I think, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=112.0s)]
*  you know, you never know here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=113.0s)]
*  Joe Biden may actually think he's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=114.0s)]
*  talking to European leaders, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=115.0s)]
*  right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=116.0s)]
*  He probably thinks he just talked [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=117.0s)]
*  to Winston Churchill or Napoleon [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=118.0s)]
*  or somebody, but the bottom line [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=119.0s)]
*  is, if you are asking us to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=120.0s)]
*  believe that right now, with [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=121.0s)]
*  Russia at Europe's doorstep, to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=122.0s)]
*  the point that they cratered to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=123.0s)]
*  go 5% to Donald Trump, we could [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=124.0s)]
*  have done that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=125.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=126.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=127.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=128.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=129.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=130.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=131.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=132.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=133.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=134.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=135.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=136.0s)]
*  We could have done that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=137.0s)]
*  The point that they cratered to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=138.0s)]
*  go 5% to Donald Trump, we could [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=139.0s)]
*  even get them to 2%. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=142.0s)]
*  That crew went to 5%. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=144.0s)]
*  They're now calling Joe Biden [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=146.0s)]
*  to say, hey, help us out here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=148.0s)]
*  We've got a lot of people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=149.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=151.0s)]
*  Yeah, Leslie, to me, the biggest [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=152.0s)]
*  part of his legacy, sadly, for [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=154.0s)]
*  him, I think is the whole [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=156.0s)]
*  cover-up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=157.0s)]
*  I really do think of him not [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=158.0s)]
*  being as involved in his own [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=160.0s)]
*  administration as we were being [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=162.0s)]
*  gaslit over and over again to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=163.0s)]
*  being told we were wrong for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=165.0s)]
*  seeing what we were seeing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=166.0s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=167.0s)]
*  I make of it that Joe Biden is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=168.0s)]
*  living in all of your heads. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=170.0s)]
*  I mean, I've moved on. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=171.0s)]
*  I'm a progressive. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=173.0s)]
*  I progress. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=174.0s)]
*  He's not moving on. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=175.0s)]
*  No, what do you mean? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=176.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=177.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=178.0s)]
*  First of all, I'm going to help [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=179.0s)]
*  you with math. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=180.0s)]
*  We have 11 million undocumented [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=181.0s)]
*  people approximately in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=182.0s)]

*  So how do we have 12 million come [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=184.0s)]
*  in? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=185.0s)]
*  And the majority of the people [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=186.0s)]
*  that are here that have been [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=187.0s)]

*  Who believed that 11 million [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=189.0s)]

*  What's wrong with that? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=207.0s)]
*  Because we were lied to. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=208.0s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=209.0s)]
*  We were gaslit for years and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=210.0s)]

*  well. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=213.0s)]
*  Kat, there's no administration [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=214.0s)]

*  You don't need to talk to me [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=217.0s)]
*  about that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=218.0s)]
*  I've been quite consistent in my [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=219.0s)]
*  distrust of government. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=220.0s)]
*  But you look at people who [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=221.0s)]

*  But you look at people who are [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=226.0s)]
*  now gaining a distrust of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=227.0s)]
*  government who may not have had [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=228.0s)]
*  one before because the things [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=229.0s)]
*  they were seeing with their own [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=230.0s)]
*  eyes, they were being told [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=231.0s)]

*  Oh, he just had a stutter. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=234.0s)]
*  Like there will be no tax on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=235.0s)]
*  Social Security when there is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=236.0s)]
*  tax on Social Security? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=237.0s)]
*  We had a man who was not making [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=238.0s)]
*  decisions. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=239.0s)]
*  There were things being signed [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=240.0s)]
*  with an auto pen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=241.0s)]
*  You asked me, but you asked me [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=242.0s)]
*  and I said no. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSlpmKaDWGY&t=243.0s)]
