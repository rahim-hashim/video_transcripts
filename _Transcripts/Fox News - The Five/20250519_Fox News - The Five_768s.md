# ‘The Five’ on the timing of Biden’s cancer diagnosis
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ)
*  All right, well, questions are mounting over former President Joe Biden's shocking stage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  four prostate cancer diagnosis, which has aggressively spread to his bones. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=4.76s)]
*  While we wish the former president well, a key ally of the Obama administration is asking [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=9.56s)]
*  why it wasn't caught sooner. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=14.08s)]
*  He did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=17.04s)]
*  He had it while he was president. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=23.8s)]
*  Yes, that I don't think there's any disagreement about that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=29.52s)]
*  So the shocking cancer diagnosis follows a brutal week for President, former President [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=34.64s)]
*  Biden as a new book and the release of the long awaited her tapes exposed more troubling [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=39.02s)]
*  instances of a mental decline that was covered up and hidden from the public. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=44.18s)]
*  But some of the media are already suggesting the cancer diagnosis might earn the former [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=49.92s)]
*  president a little breathing room from all the scrutiny. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=54.14s)]
*  Those conversations are going to happen, but they should be more muted and set aside for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  now as he's struggling through this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=66.28s)]
*  It seems to me, Jessica, this debate doesn't end at all, but it is briefly put on pause [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=70.16s)]
*  as a result of today's news. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=74.8s)]
*  But the her audio release continues to reverberate as Democrats and the media try to learn lessons [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=76.88000000000001s)]
*  from the cover up. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=81.64s)]
*  And that is a crime against this republic. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  And I think the Democrats are going to pay for a long time for being a part of what is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=87.84s)]
*  now being revealed to be a massive cover up. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=91.56s)]
*  We apologize to the American people that we were part of something that wasn't on the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=94.0s)]
*  up and up. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=98.76s)]
*  But ultimately, in retrospect, you can't defend what the Democratic Party did because we are [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=99.76s)]
*  stuck with a madman, with a corrupt president in the Oval Office. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=103.9s)]
*  And we should have given ourselves a better chance to win. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=108.14s)]
*  Hindsight is 2020. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=110.66000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, if we could redo this tape and play it over again, we would do things differently. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  It's hard to convince somebody to give up their car keys. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=119.58000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Jesse, we all wish the former president well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=122.5s)]
*  I mean, it's just absolutely awful for any family to learn this about their loved one. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  But there's a lot it seems that we are learning in the last 24 hours. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=129.98s)]
*  A lot it seems that perhaps we didn't know along the way. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=134.14s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=137.38s)]
*  Well, first, my heart goes out to the Bidens and the Biden family. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=138.38s)]
*  Very unfortunate diagnosis and we hope he beats it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=141.66s)]
*  But a lot of people are speculating whether this was medical malpractice or whether this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=144.78s)]
*  was a medical cover up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=149.28s)]
*  And we have every right to speculate because they have been caught in so many lies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=151.56s)]
*  So the medical cover up is not being said by Jesse Waters. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  It's being said all over the media by Democrats and by physicians. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=160.82s)]
*  They're saying that this was caught possibly earlier and then nothing was released and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  then possibly exposed as a way to blunt the impact of the Her Report audio release and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=173.04s)]
*  the book. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=179.73999999999998s)]
*  Now, I don't think that's possible, but at this point, anything's possible. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  The other one is the medical malpractice. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  How are you not going to give a guy a PSA test? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=186.82s)]
*  How are you not going to give someone a test and then not release the results? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  Did they not give this test to Joe Biden because they gave it to the last three presidents [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=195.7s)]
*  and then they released the PSA numbers? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=200.38s)]
*  So who knows if he even got tested? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=202.82s)]
*  He was supposed to have had a full test a year ago and they said there was no cancer [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=204.92s)]
*  detected. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=209.22s)]
*  Well, we need to know exactly what tests they did. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=210.22s)]
*  Since 2000, Joe Biden has broken his foot. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=214.26s)]
*  He's had skin cancer. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=218.46s)]
*  He has had two horrible bouts with COVID-19 and then he was living as president with prostate [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=220.66s)]
*  cancer and the entire media said he was healthy as an ox and that they said he was running [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=227.06s)]
*  circles around binder. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=232.98s)]
*  And so this doctor, O'Connor, was his personal physician. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  There's a funny axiom that says, you know, having a personal physician 24-7 around the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=239.7s)]
*  clock is a leading indicator of death. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=245.78s)]
*  A lot of celebrities, a lot of wealthy individuals have these doctors on call and they kind of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=248.9s)]
*  give you anything and they're just there to protect the brand, there to protect the status [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=253.78s)]
*  and the job. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=257.58s)]
*  That happens with some people, but this guy, O'Connor, takes it to a next level. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=259.06s)]
*  This guy was brought in from Delaware and he was in business with the Biden family and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=263.62s)]
*  it was this oldest president in American history, probably the sickest sitting president of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=269.26s)]
*  this century, and he never gave a press conference. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=274.46s)]
*  In four years, O'Connor never came to the press and said, this is what the president [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=277.54s)]
*  is dealing with. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=282.66s)]
*  That is, he needs to be brought in, he needs to be subpoenaed, and he needs to answer some [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=284.58s)]
*  of these questions. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=289.54s)]
*  I can't believe if he had won, Joe Biden would have died in office and Kamala would have [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  been president and the doctors in the media would have been like, oops, sorry, we missed it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=296.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=301.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=303.5s)]
*  Well, Howard, there are multiple experts who have lined up in the wake of this news to say, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=304.22s)]
*  you know, it would be shocking that this kind of cancer wasn't noticed during recent checkups [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=309.5s)]
*  that it had to have been developing for quite some time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  Howard Foreman, Yale Law School, Yale Medical School, it's inconceivable that this was not [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  being followed before he left the presidency. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=321.82s)]
*  Urologist David Shusterman says it's insanely unlikely someone who gets annual checkups [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=324.62s)]
*  would not have noticed this developing cancer. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=329.9s)]
*  So my prayers, like yours, Jesse, go out to his family. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=333.34s)]
*  This is a tough diagnosis. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  I have friends and family who have this, who've had the diagnosis and I can only imagine a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=337.41999999999996s)]
*  tough struggle and a tough road ahead. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=344.14s)]
*  I aligned with Jesse on this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=346.62s)]
*  I think that the fact that the president of the United States is not getting as [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=349.42s)]
*  exhaustive of a review of a physical, the kind of medical examination one would expect, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=355.18s)]
*  and then to have all of that revealed to the public in 2025, 25 years into the 21st century, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=361.74s)]
*  you combine that with some of the things that we, people were saying about President Biden [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=370.21999999999997s)]
*  throughout his presidency, questioning the cognitive abilities, some of the mental health [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=374.86s)]
*  abilities, and then the physical things that happened when he fell down, fell up the stairs, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=380.06s)]
*  down the stairs, off his bike. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  We deserve better. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=387.74s)]
*  I hope, going, what we really learned from this, I'm not one to look backwards, although I pray [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=389.5s)]
*  for him, I hope that what we do going forward is to ask these doctors and physicians, Jesse, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=394.06s)]
*  we ought to have a different standard for all of this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=399.98s)]
*  When you think about the president's role of growing the economy, keeping the country safe, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=401.82s)]
*  we're in basically a new economic cold war with China and Russia is emerging again. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=405.58s)]
*  We need to know everything about our president and this shouldn't be by chance, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=411.74s)]
*  by any measure. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=417.5s)]
*  I don't, I listen to Dr. Emanuel, he's far brighter than I am and more experienced and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  more educated than I am on these matters. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=422.46s)]
*  I do have a dear friend whose wife got a stage four cancer diagnosis very late, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=423.98s)]
*  had not seen it before and she had had an injury and got the diagnosis and passed about a year later. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=428.7s)]
*  So these things, I imagine can happen, but when you are the president of the United States, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  what the kind of care the president should get, we should not be surprised by these things. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  But I'm like you, my thoughts and prayers are with he and his family. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=442.94s)]
*  I know this road ahead is going to be a difficult one. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=445.26s)]
*  And again, we wish him the absolute best. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  Greg, is it fair for some of the media, including David Axelrod now to be saying that we should set [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=449.74s)]
*  aside any talk about the cognitive cover up during his presidency as he battles this cancer? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=455.02s)]
*  When they say something like that, you have to believe that that's the reason why they're [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=461.41999999999996s)]
*  breaking the news now. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=466.14s)]
*  So you do mute and you do pause. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=467.82s)]
*  The timing is telling you that this cancer is being used as a tool to deflect from outrage [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=470.29999999999995s)]
*  to sympathy. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=475.97999999999996s)]
*  But get this, normal human beings, we can have both. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=477.26s)]
*  We can feel sad for somebody who has cancer. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=479.65999999999997s)]
*  Like Harold said, we all know people intimately who have cancer, who are dying from cancer, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=482.06s)]
*  and who will die of cancer. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=488.14s)]
*  So we can feel sad, but that's not going to infringe on the space in my brain that is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=489.82s)]
*  reserved and dedicated to this cover up of his incapacitation. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=494.7s)]
*  So you're not going to get a mute or a pause from me, but nice try. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=499.74s)]
*  We're talking about like, how could this happen? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=506.7s)]
*  We've always been saying about all of these problems in the last eight years, how did [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=509.42s)]
*  this happen? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=514.22s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=515.02s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  I say eight years because this has been going on before Biden was president. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=516.94s)]
*  The neglect is on purpose. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=520.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, we, for example, just focus on Joe Biden, the elder abuse line that we kept hearing. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=522.38s)]
*  Why did it continue? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=527.74s)]
*  Because Joe was docile and fragile and offering no resistance to any part of the progressive [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=529.5s)]
*  agenda. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=537.98s)]
*  Joe's dysfunction may have been caused not by disability, but by debility, meaning he [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=538.94s)]
*  was worn down on purpose, deliberately kept feeble and weak, which made him pliable like [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=545.5s)]
*  a POW, except the W stands for White House. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=552.54s)]
*  Joe's dysfunction was not prevented when it could have been because it kept him easily [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=555.98s)]
*  managed. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=562.46s)]
*  He was always tired. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=563.4200000000001s)]
*  He probably didn't want to answer questions or sign things. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=565.1s)]
*  So we've seen a series of colossal blunders and deliberate coverups. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=568.7s)]
*  All are ethically indefensible. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=574.62s)]
*  All you can do if you're doing this stuff is tell yourself, consider the alternative. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=577.34s)]
*  And the alternative to them was always Trump. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=582.86s)]
*  That was their narrative. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=586.22s)]
*  Like they can cover up this guy who is physically and mentally feeble because look at the other [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=587.34s)]
*  guy. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=594.3s)]
*  It's Trump. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=594.78s)]
*  So Trump is an existential threat. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=595.5s)]
*  That narrative became justification for every kind of immoral behavior, including allowing [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=598.2199999999999s)]
*  violence, the implosion of a border, coverups, blatant, blatant illegal activity, siding [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=604.4599999999999s)]
*  with gang bangers. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=611.8199999999999s)]
*  Up to now, Hamas sympathizers. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=613.0999999999999s)]
*  You can approve of anything. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=615.3399999999999s)]
*  If you sell people the belief, you assign the opinion that Trump is an existential risk, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=617.82s)]
*  they knew about all this stuff. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=624.7s)]
*  They covered it up. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=626.14s)]
*  Well, we did see the media having to deal with the release of the Her audio and the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=627.02s)]
*  Her tape today. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=631.66s)]
*  In what appears to be the many stages of coping, Katie, Van Jones said that Democrats will [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=633.26s)]
*  pay for covering up Biden's decline for a quote, long time. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=637.98s)]
*  Yeah, because this is a total betrayal of the American people. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=641.9s)]
*  This is about breaking of trust, and it's very difficult to get it back once it's been [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=646.6999999999999s)]
*  broken. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=651.18s)]
*  Now, in politics, trust can be a relative term because of the industry that you're dealing [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=651.5s)]
*  with, but they covered up thing after thing after thing. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=656.54s)]
*  And then when the American people who are part of this republic democratic process were [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=660.46s)]
*  allowed to ask questions about the president of the United States who was elected, they [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=664.6999999999999s)]
*  were told that they were crazy, that they were mean people for questioning the president's [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=669.02s)]
*  cognitive state, that they weren't empathetic. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=673.98s)]
*  And now you're seeing that happening again with David Axelrod saying, well, we can't [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=676.62s)]
*  really talk about it anymore. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=680.54s)]
*  And the implication there is that if you dare to ask questions about the betrayal from [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=682.14s)]
*  the Biden White House, from the Democrats as a whole, then you're just not an empathetic [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=687.9s)]
*  person. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=692.38s)]
*  You don't understand when people get diagnosed with cancer when it's really a bigger issue [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=692.7s)]
*  of what's been going on for the last couple of years. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=697.66s)]
*  I don't know how they get out of this because in order to regain the trust that they've [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=700.86s)]
*  lost, you have to be very transparent, overwhelmingly. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=704.38s)]
*  And yet they're still doubling down on covering up and not talking about it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=708.38s)]
*  So politically for them, it's very difficult for them to go out and say, you can trust [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=712.3s)]
*  us and believe us when we're talking about things that we'll do for you. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=716.78s)]
*  And they can't even come to terms with the fact that this was obvious for years. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=719.42s)]
*  The White House doctor not coming out to give press conferences, not answering any questions. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=723.8199999999999s)]
*  I went back through all of the letters that the White House doctor put out, not a single [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=728.3s)]
*  mention of this. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  And also it's kind of a betrayal to the president. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=733.66s)]
*  How did you not, if this is what they weren't doing, give someone of that age, the president [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=736.54s)]
*  of the United States, that kind of physical test? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=741.5799999999999s)]
*  How could you not give the test? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=744.54s)]
*  Those questions will be asked for a long time. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=745.9s)]
*  Many people watching right now go out and get those tests on a regular basis. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=748.4599999999999s)]
*  Katie, thank you for that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=752.06s)]
*  Up next, Hillary Clinton and Tim Walz taking aim at President Trump with some [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=753.18s)]
*  really wild accusations. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB1YtO8eeQ&t=756.54s)]
