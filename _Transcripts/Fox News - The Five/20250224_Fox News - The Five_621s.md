# ‘The Five’: Elon Musk sends a ‘pulse check’ to the swamp
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk)
*  It's the Doge ultimatum. Elon Musk, emailing over 2 million federal workers with this subject [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=0.0s)]
*  line, what did you do last week? It simply asked them to list five things they accomplished [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=5.64s)]
*  at work and says not replying by midnight tonight would be taken as a resignation. However, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=10.28s)]
*  Fox News can confirm that the Office of Personnel Management has told agency heads that they [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=16.0s)]
*  don't need to fire people who don't reply to the five things emails and that the administration [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  will work with the individual departments. And while that all gets sorted out, President [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=26.2s)]
*  Trump is gladly backing up the Doge mail by posting SpongeBob memes and doubling down [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=31.32s)]
*  at the White House. I thought it was great because we have people that don't show up [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=36.12s)]
*  to work and nobody even knows if they work for the government. So by asking the question, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=41.56s)]
*  tell us what you did this week. What he's doing is saying, are you actually working? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=45.76s)]
*  And then if you don't answer, like you're sort of semi fired or you're fired because [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=50.72s)]
*  a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist. They're trying to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=56.379999999999995s)]
*  fight. That's how badly various parts of our government were run by it, especially [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  by this last group. Musk is also brushing off the backlash, saying this, this email [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=65.36s)]
*  is a very basic pulse check. But of course there is outrage. Democratic Senator Tina [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=71.44s)]
*  Smith calling Musk a bad boss and using some salty words to say it. And others in the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=76.56s)]
*  press were equally outraged. Elon Musk has zero legal authority to fire government employees [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=81.64s)]
*  or force their resignations. These people don't report to Elon Musk. This nonsensical [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=87.68s)]
*  email from from Elon Musk acting like we're in kindergarten. It's like an own the libs, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=93.18s)]
*  make you cry more sort of environment, right? Where both Trump and Musk are performing for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=100.72s)]
*  the MAGA base. The new Trump administration is reveling in its bad knuckle approach to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=105.52s)]
*  governing. This is so sloppy with the way Elon Musk is handling this. All right. So [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=112.44s)]
*  earlier today, Greg, the Harvard Harris Poll came out and said 76 percent of Americans [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=119.88s)]
*  support what Doge is trying to do, asking people to show their work. The American Federation [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=124.16s)]
*  of Government Employees, that's the union, said that the email was cruel and disrespectful. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=129.04s)]
*  First of all, Jen Psaki, Michael Steele, all you're not clearly you're not outraged that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=135.4s)]
*  your coworkers just got dozed. I mean, you just you just lost Joy Reid, Jonathan Capehart, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  Katie Fang, who else did they like this Wagner? They all went over. But that's OK. That's OK. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=148.84s)]
*  Because in the media, you never talk about that. Yeah. The thing is, this was obviously the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=155.88s)]
*  email was just a test to see if you still exist. You know, this is what you do for the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=160.0s)]
*  George Costanzas, you know, the people that maintain a position but not a presence. So [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=164.18s)]
*  it's a bureaucratic bird call. And I've had to clean house a couple of times when I was [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=168.94s)]
*  an editor. And you always start with the outside in and you. You have to do things in a big [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=173.94s)]
*  way. And when you listen to these criticisms, it sounded it sounds exactly like they what [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=179.46s)]
*  they said about the border. When we were in crisis at the border, there was nothing you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  could do about it. Oh, you can do the little things, but you can't do the big thing. Seal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=189.66s)]
*  the border because it's too mean. It's too heartless. It's too insensitive. It doesn't show [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=194.5s)]
*  any empathy. And if you cast a wide net, whether it's Dozier, the border, you're always going [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=200.1s)]
*  to get some wrong people, the wrong people. But that's the argument whenever you're dealing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=205.54s)]
*  with excess, whenever you need to cut and you know that the company's in trouble, they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=210.1s)]
*  will always try to stop it by using that argument that it's inhumane. But the only approach [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=215.62s)]
*  to reforming a bloated system is cutting it quick and cutting it fast. And if you make [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=221.02s)]
*  mistakes and it's messy, at least you can rectify it. It's not like releasing violent [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=225.62s)]
*  felons into the general population who then kill people or letting your troops die in a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=230.1s)]
*  chaotic withdrawal from a foreign country. Bureaucracy is actually an area where you don't [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=234.82s)]
*  a scalpel. In fact, a scalpel cannot keep up with the growth of bureaucracy. You need [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=240.45999999999998s)]
*  a chainsaw. You need an axe, especially when it's this dire. And the people in the media [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=245.89999999999998s)]
*  and the politicians aren't telling you how bad it really is. And it was Malay, the president [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  of Argentina, who gave Elon Musk that chainsaw. What he did when he first came in, their government [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=256.3s)]
*  was a lot bigger than ours even. And it was a little crazy. He like just axed, I think [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=260.94s)]
*  all of a sudden in one fell swoop, 18 departments were out the door. A lot of people in the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=265.3s)]
*  private sector, Jesse, might be have empathy for people losing their jobs, but might be [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=269.86s)]
*  rolling their eyes at the suggestion that it would be cruel and disrespectful to ask [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=275.14000000000004s)]
*  for just a little update on what you did last week. I updated everybody on what I did last [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=279.94000000000005s)]
*  week. Oh, OK. Here's my five bullet points. Had a pretty good week. Yeah. I worked on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=284.66s)]
*  a federal holiday when everybody else stayed home. Wow. When. That counts as two then. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=290.22s)]
*  I made a brilliant and persuasive argument for Doge dividend checks. I annihilated Jessica. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=296.94000000000005s)]
*  Audience loved it. Ratings soared. I hopped Fox merch. You did. Shamelessly, but effectively. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=307.14000000000004s)]
*  And it increased revenues here. One hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I also hitched [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=316.18s)]
*  hiked home on Friday to save the company money on car services. I actually didn't do that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  But this is what he's doing is no different than what generals do. CEOs Ben Franklin. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=328.78s)]
*  What did he say? What have you done to make yourself better today? What did you do to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  organization better today? So when I see a request like this, I'm inspired. Other people [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  felt like it was demeaning. And if you think an email like this is demeaning, you're part [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=348.3s)]
*  of the problem. Because if you don't think you have to justify your job and you think [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  you're entitled to your job, then that's why we need an attitude adjustment. This is what [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=358.06s)]
*  this was. This is an attitude adjustment. People need to be reminded that their public [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=363.5s)]
*  servants, they serve the public. They're not there to serve themselves from the public [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=368.66s)]
*  piggyback. Now, the fact that they're circling the wagons around these bureaucrats, it's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=375.66s)]
*  infantilizing them. Like you can't fire them. You can't email them. You can't make them [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=383.66s)]
*  come to work. This is like when Uncle Tony gives his dumb cousin a job at the dock that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=388.94s)]
*  he doesn't have to show up for. He gets six figures, no paid job. But you can't talk to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=395.7s)]
*  Tony. You can't email Tony. You can't ask him. No one can say anything to Tony. He's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=400.78s)]
*  privileged. And now bureaucrats have more special protections than the trans community [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=405.41999999999996s)]
*  did at its heyday. What do you think about that Tony analogy, Jessica? I get it. I know [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=412.26s)]
*  about Tony's nephew and how that happens. I just don't think it's applicable to what's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=420.05999999999995s)]
*  going on here. And you would know that what Elon Musk did, this directive, was a good [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=425.3s)]
*  approach to it if everyone had gone along with it. But you saw all of these Trump cabinet [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=431.94000000000005s)]
*  appointees who instructed their bureaucracies not to respond. Department of Defense, Department [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=436.18s)]
*  of Homeland Security, the FBI, the State Department all said, don't worry, if you saw that email, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=440.82000000000005s)]
*  don't say anything. So if it is going to save America, why don't the rest of the people [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  that Donald Trump loves think that it's a good idea? Well, if you're in the Pentagon, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=452.1s)]
*  you can't Elon Musk email him and say, oh, I staged a coup in Cambodia last week. But [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=455.66s)]
*  that's an argument for Elon Musk taking a breather before he sends an email like that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=462.34s)]
*  to millions of people and say, oh, maybe folks who work on classified information can't respond [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=466.86s)]
*  to this right away. Or maybe a federal judge who's going to get this email Saturday night [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=471.58s)]
*  or whatever isn't going to be able to talk about privileged information that's going [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=475.78s)]
*  on in their courtrooms, for instance. I might just write back and say, see me, if that were. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=480.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'll get back to you. Especially people who want a curry favor with Elon and the rest [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=485.5s)]
*  of the Doge Department. Of course, they're going to say see me because they want a little [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=491.58s)]
*  bit of FaceTime. I don't think this is the worst thing in the world. And I'm sure there [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=495.26s)]
*  will be other instances where lines will be crossed. The sky will feel like it's falling. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=500.53999999999996s)]
*  This is not the time to ring the alarm and say that we just want from orange to red. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=506.54s)]
*  We're not quite there yet because in the great words of Socrates as written by Plato, the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=513.1s)]
*  unexamined life is not worth living. And I would argue that there are a lot of government [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=517.14s)]
*  employees who've not been forced to examine their work because they do have a sense of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=521.26s)]
*  entitlement. So if you have to sit there and figure out five things you did last week, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=526.3000000000001s)]
*  two things can happen. One, you're completely worthless and you shouldn't be on the government [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=531.62s)]
*  seat and you should be relieved of duty because you're wasting taxpayer money. Or you're going [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=536.1800000000001s)]
*  to come up with a list that is so impressive that people will take notice. And those are [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=541.0600000000001s)]
*  the kind of people that we have to have left running government because there are critical [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=545.9s)]
*  aspects that have to be staffed. And I'd much rather they be staffed by people who are competent, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=550.9s)]
*  hardworking and not a bunch of fuss budget pearl clutch. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=556.26s)]
*  Fuss budget pearl clutches. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=561.5s)]
*  It might be the first time ever said on the fly. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=563.3000000000001s)]
*  I always wonder, and then I'll shut up, how do Democrats think businesses work? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=565.66s)]
*  They don't think. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4U-Pvzlsk&t=570.66s)]
