# 'The Five' highlight Tom Homan blasting Boston's top cop over immigration policies
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I)
*  Tom Homan is done playing nice with the sanctuary cities that defy ICE. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's borders are might be shipping up to Boston soon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=4.32s)]
*  That's in Massachusetts, Jesse. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=7.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=9.56s)]
*  As city leaders there refused to help border agents enforce immigration laws. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=10.08s)]
*  I read a story last night, the police commissioner of Boston, you said you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  doubled down on not helping the law enforcement office of ICE. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=20.88s)]
*  I'm coming to Boston, I'm bringing hell with me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=26.12s)]
*  I looked at the numbers this morning, nine child rapists that were in jail in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=28.44s)]
*  Massachusetts, but rather than honoring an icy tater, released them back into [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=35.56s)]
*  the street. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=41.2s)]
*  You're not a police commissioner. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Take that badge off your chest, put it in the desk drawer because you became a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=43.8s)]
*  politician. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  You forgot what it's like to be a cop. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=48.92s)]
*  My goodness. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=51.84s)]
*  But Democrat leaders in Massachusetts are vowing to wage war over Trump's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  illegal immigration crackdown. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=57.8s)]
*  The trans sanctuary town near Boston is responding to Homan by posting, quote, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=59.04s)]
*  we will meet you with hell too. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  So Dana, kind of a war of words, but he seems like he is going to war with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=68.16s)]
*  deeds. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=74.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=75.28s)]
*  And then you had the city councilwoman who basically said it was laughable and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=75.44s)]
*  says, we don't scare easily. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=80.08s)]
*  That's what she's saying, Tom Homan. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=82.16s)]
*  We had Corinne Hajar on today. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=83.6s)]
*  She's an opinion writer for the Boston Globe. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=85.24s)]
*  She's been doing meticulous work about all the different types of crimes and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=87.24s)]
*  criminals that are there, including the child rapist. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=91.32s)]
*  She's asked for documents. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=93.44s)]
*  They send these documents over to her. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=94.76s)]
*  They're all redacted. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=96.44s)]
*  So you can't look at all the information of the crimes that were committed and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=97.8s)]
*  guess who they're committed against? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=101.92s)]
*  Other illegal immigrants. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=103.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=105.0s)]
*  Who don't come forward. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=105.28s)]
*  Who are they protecting? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=106.0s)]
*  Good point. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=107.48s)]
*  But, you know, Jessica, only nine child rapists out of a big city like that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=108.52s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=115.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=115.72s)]
*  Tiny, tiny little population. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=116.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  No, like hands off our dreamers has a good ring to it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=118.84s)]
*  Hands off our child rapists does not. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=126.04s)]
*  And I understand that these city councils are going to have to look at the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=126.44s)]
*  sanctuary laws in order to allow ICE into the prisons, because the reason the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  laws were designed this way was so that they couldn't pick up people who haven't [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=137.32s)]
*  had their day in court yet, that you have to actually be convicted of the crime [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  versus just arrested for the crime and being held until you until you get your [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=143.48s)]
*  day in court. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=147.92s)]
*  And there are even some people on the left who are saying, sorry, like you should [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=149.48s)]
*  be allowed in. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=154.0s)]
*  That's what Eric Adams is essentially saying. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=154.68s)]
*  He wants to be able to open up Rikers to ICE as part of this little quid pro quo [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=156.32s)]
*  that perhaps he's engaging in. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=161.52s)]
*  I didn't know there were actual sanctuary laws. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=163.24s)]
*  The law, actual laws. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=166.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's what happened. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=167.84s)]
*  That's why Eric Adams is having a hard time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  The city council actually controls those laws. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=172.36s)]
*  I should read more. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=174.68s)]
*  Kennedy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=176.52s)]
*  Don't change. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=177.2s)]
*  I won't change. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=177.96s)]
*  Not for anyone. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=178.76s)]
*  Kennedy, you were quite impressed by Homan. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=179.84s)]
*  I could hear you sigh. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=181.88s)]
*  Really was. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=183.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=184.04s)]
*  Just what a he's a he's a whole man. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=184.32s)]
*  He's not a half a man. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=188.44s)]
*  He's a whole man. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=189.36s)]
*  And he definitely means business. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=191.68s)]
*  I think if you took those nine child rapists and you put them in a halfway house [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=193.76s)]
*  next door to one of the city council members, they would feel I think that they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=198.56s)]
*  would have a slightly different reaction. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=202.24s)]
*  They would feel unsafe and rightly so. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=205.0s)]
*  So I think, you know, what we need to do as a society is admit that our immigration [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  laws, for better or worse, are not working, that it truly is a broken system. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  So if part of it is going to work, Democrats are going to have to come forward and say, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=218.28s)]
*  yes, let's get rid of the worst people like you can. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  I will grant them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  Immigrants are amazing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=227.0s)]
*  They are the hardest working people. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=228.68s)]
*  They make this country better. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=230.12s)]
*  All of our ancestors were immigrants either recent or, you know, in generations past. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=231.56s)]
*  The point is, this is why America is wonderful. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=237.36s)]
*  America is not wonderful with Trendo Ragua or MS-13 or a bunch of child rapists who [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=240.0s)]
*  disgustingly prey on these migrant children. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=245.88s)]
*  So if they're not protecting the migrant children, that means they're also not [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=249.16s)]
*  protecting the kids who were born here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=252.36s)]
*  All of them have the right to be safe. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=254.84s)]
*  But Democrats have to admit that the bad ones have to go. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=257.36s)]
*  And if it's not going to be ICE, then they have to do it themselves. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=260.76000000000005s)]
*  And they're not. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  It just blows my mind that we're even having this conversation. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  It's like we're sitting here discussing why they haven't deported. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's not we I can understand a debate over illegal immigration, but we're [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=272.72s)]
*  not even there yet. We're talking about child rapists. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm not talking about child rapists. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=279.48s)]
*  I'm talking about sexiness. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  If you were to do one of those charity events, Greg, yes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=284.6s)]
*  And you know how you can like bid on like a night with a bachelor, you know, and like [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  the highest bidder gets to like take home the bachelor one night. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=293.0s)]
*  And it's like these old women are like a hundred dollars. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=295.6s)]
*  If you put I've never heard this, it was on Groundhog Day. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=298.48s)]
*  Haven't you seen that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  Oh, and Kramer and Seinfeld. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=302.72s)]
*  Remember? Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  OK, you didn't see that episode. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=306.04s)]
*  Yes, I did. OK, if you would have Pete Hegseth up for auction. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes. If you would add Tom Homan on stage and Stephen Miller, who do you think would [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=312.04s)]
*  get the most money? Wow. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=317.92s)]
*  I don't know if I want to play this game. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=319.48s)]
*  Played it in the green room. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=321.76s)]
*  I'm going to go with I'm going to go with Homan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=323.08s)]
*  You're going with Homan. That's what he has this understated masculinity about him. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=325.36s)]
*  You were saying that you were threatened by them just then. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=330.2s)]
*  You said you were threatened by him. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  No, I took that differently than threatened. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=335.36s)]
*  You I said that Pete would go. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF7SO6rUv9I&t=337.4s)]
