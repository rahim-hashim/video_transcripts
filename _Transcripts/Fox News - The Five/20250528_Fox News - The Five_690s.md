# ‘The Five’: Dems are ‘facing a HUGE cliff’
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8)
*  Hello everybody, I'm Jesse Waters along with Rosanna Scotto, Jessica Tarlov, Dana Perino, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=0.0s)]
*  and Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=5.12s)]
*  It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=6.12s)]
*  Six months after Kamala got steamrolled and banished to Australia for speaking gigs, the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=15.32s)]
*  Democratic Party just took another smack from the ugly stick of unpopularity. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=19.76s)]
*  According to the latest poll, Republicans have a 10-point advantage on net favorability. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=24.28s)]
*  But have no fear, Libs, Mayor Pete thinks ditching the all the hoity-toity talk will [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=29.5s)]
*  help Democrats win back their spot at the cool kids table. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=34.26s)]
*  If I hear one more time, like, a well-off liberal doctor or lawyer saying, you know, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=38.3s)]
*  that quote unquote, these folks are voting against their economic interests, I just wonder [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=49.78s)]
*  whether they've ever contemplated the fact that somebody could turn around and say, so [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=56.78s)]
*  are you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=60.24s)]
*  There's a condescension that is imputed to Democrats that I think we really need to deal [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  with. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=70.0s)]
*  But Libby, little Debbie thinks the voters have got it all wrong about the Democrats. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=71.36s)]
*  Democrats are typically tagged as tortoises, slugs, or sloths, slow, plotting, passive. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=76.56s)]
*  And then a little bit later, there was a respond to you said the Democrats are like deer in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=83.66s)]
*  headlights. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=87.7s)]
*  How is it that you think that the Democratic Party has earned these descriptions? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=89.46s)]
*  John, I'm not focused on the animals that some New York Times reporter compares the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=95.3s)]
*  political parties to. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=103.94s)]
*  My constituents are human beings. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=105.58s)]
*  I'm focused on the humans I represent, not animal comparisons. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=107.5s)]
*  And now Politico is proposing a bizarre shadow cabinet of Democrats to challenge the Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=113.12s)]
*  administration featuring such gems as alleged fraudster Tish James as attorney general, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=117.6s)]
*  Jon Stewart as VA secretary, Giselle Federman, the wife of Big John, would be DHS secretary, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=124.04s)]
*  Bill Nye the Science Guy as EPA head, and comedian Nikki Glaser for the Small Business [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=130.88s)]
*  Administration. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=136.36s)]
*  This is an interesting idea. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=137.36s)]
*  Shadow cabinet, Dana. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=138.86s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=141.5s)]
*  I mean, but they are grasping at straws, okay? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=142.5s)]
*  And they're circling the drain. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=145.02s)]
*  There's lots of analogies that we could use for this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=146.02s)]
*  I joked with Jessica, I've seen her in a week, that I leave and then I come back and it's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=148.38s)]
*  the same topic. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=152.86s)]
*  And I think, and when Hammer asked me this morning, how long does this news cycle last, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=153.86s)]
*  I said, I think it's for a long time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  I don't see anything really getting it off of the front page because one, they're not [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=160.18s)]
*  dealing with it directly, and two, there's just so much more. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=165.02s)]
*  In fact, Fox News Digital just has a piece up today about a lot of the executive orders [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=168.42s)]
*  and how many of them were signed by AutoPen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=172.92s)]
*  And these were huge sweeping deals. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=175.32s)]
*  And we have, not testimony, but we have on the record comments from Speaker Johnson. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=177.64s)]
*  Remember when he went and he had a meeting with Biden and he says, why did you sign the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=183.72s)]
*  executive order to ban LNG? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  And he says, I never did that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=189.6s)]
*  I said, yes, you did. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=190.92s)]
*  I'm like, well, it was just a study. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=191.92s)]
*  Oh, guess what? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  the EPA gets signed off and Biden didn't know anything about it and he wouldn't have done [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=195.18s)]
*  that if he knew. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=200.16s)]
*  I mean, that to me is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=201.16s)]
*  So a lot more to come. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=203.44s)]
*  And also you have the fact that there's a split in the Democratic Party that's very [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=204.78s)]
*  interesting. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=209.44s)]
*  You have someone like Rahm Emanuel who's saying we have to go back to the center. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=210.44s)]
*  That's probably true if they want to win, but that's not where the base is. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=213.36s)]
*  The base is so much farther to the left. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=216.84s)]
*  Two weeks ago, AOC was seen as the person who's the number one choice for Democrats, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=219.56s)]
*  the most exciting person, the Democratic Party, the people that the one that people are looking [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=224.68s)]
*  to. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=230.28s)]
*  Last week, she called for ending ICE. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=231.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=233.4s)]
*  The policies that she has are much further to the left than someone like Rahm Emanuel [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=234.4s)]
*  wants to go. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  So they need like a giant etch and sketch to shake all around to see if they can get [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  rid of the policy positions they've had since 2016, 15, 16, 17. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=243.04s)]
*  I just don't see this ending for quite a while. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=248.64s)]
*  Jessica, some may say this will go on forever. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=250.72s)]
*  Are those people our producers? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=254.44s)]
*  That person is me. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=255.92s)]
*  But when Dana brings up the auto pen, that means it's a legit scandal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=258.44s)]
*  It's not a conspiracy theory. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=263.94s)]
*  By this table standards, yes, I think Dana the most seriously for sure. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=266.96s)]
*  Listen, I feel like we are kind of halfway through the original sin cycle. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=271.2s)]
*  There are a couple more books to come and every time that one comes out, it's going [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=276.12s)]
*  to be rough. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=280.32s)]
*  There are going to be details. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=281.32s)]
*  There are going to be new names of people who should have said something but didn't [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=282.32s)]
*  say something and I'll have a bad week, but I'm in it for the long haul and I'm committed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=286.72s)]
*  And I'm also committed to the truth, Jesse. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=293.04s)]
*  And the truth is that the Democrats are very unpopular, but so is a lot of what Donald [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=296.6s)]
*  Trump is doing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=301.94s)]
*  So in a polling, Marquette, Fox News, all the goodies, he's down 16 on the economy, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=303.48s)]
*  down 14 on foreign policy, 26 on handling tariffs and 32 on cost of living. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=312.48s)]
*  And this reconciliation bill that they're trying to pass through the Senate right now [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=317.76s)]
*  has opposition from more senators than they can handle. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=321.24s)]
*  So you've got the Josh Hollies of the world who's miraculously concerned about throwing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=324.92s)]
*  Rick Scott and Maria Bartiromo was raking him over the coals this morning about his [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=329.24s)]
*  views. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=335.72s)]
*  Rand Paul, who has been talking about everything from how unconstitutional it is for Trump [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=336.72s)]
*  to be putting in these tariffs to how we're ballooning the deficit. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=340.64s)]
*  Ron Johnson, Susan Collins, Jerry Moran. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=343.76s)]
*  Those are a lot of senators that you've got to get on board. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=345.88s)]
*  So if this is the big ticket item, right, this is the big marquee agenda piece that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=348.8s)]
*  we're going to give tax cuts to the wealthy and we're going to take away food assistance [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=353.12s)]
*  so we're hurting the poor to help the rich. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=357.2s)]
*  That does not bode well for 2026 for the Republicans or for 2028 when we're going to have a big, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=360.16s)]
*  beautiful primary and we will get a great candidate and everyone will forget about the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=365.88s)]
*  hoity toity and we shall be victorious. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=369.92s)]
*  Jessica thinks she can sell that agenda, Greg, that Trump's this guy that hates the poor [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=372.12s)]
*  and he's just out for Wall Street. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=376.44s)]
*  He's the exact opposite. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=378.2s)]
*  It's the exact opposite. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=380.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=381.16s)]
*  The funny thing is the reason why there's so much opposition to the bill is because [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=382.16s)]
*  it didn't go far enough. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=385.12s)]
*  This is not about spending. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you're saying this bill is awful because they're going to be cutting. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=389.08s)]
*  We have to cut. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=394.44s)]
*  We are heading toward a doom, we're in a doom spiral. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=395.88s)]
*  But it balloons the deficit. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=400.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=401.36s)]
*  I'm saying that, but that's not why you're mad about it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=402.36s)]
*  You're mad that they might cut something or they might cut taxes and they might cut Medicaid. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=404.64s)]
*  I'm saying is you should be mad that they're not cutting more. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  In terms of cutting Medicaid, let's be honest about the Medicaid stuff. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=413.08000000000004s)]
*  This is about able-bodied young men and illegal immigrants. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=416.66s)]
*  So push that aside and talk about the fact that you and I don't like the bill, but I [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=420.0s)]
*  don't like the bill because it's not going to stop the apocalypse. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  You don't like the bill because you want to press on the gas and go right off the cliff. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=428.72s)]
*  Those are two different attitudes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=433.44s)]
*  We need to cut the deficit, not raise it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=435.16s)]
*  Can I talk about the shadow cabinet? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=439.92s)]
*  Please. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  This is what is this story called? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  I know it's not summer. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=444.0s)]
*  It's a clickbait story. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a summer clickbait story. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=447.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, no research, no no reporting at all. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=449.28s)]
*  As for a shadow cabinet, we already had one. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it was four years under Biden. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=455.47999999999996s)]
*  It was a cabal. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=458.2s)]
*  It was responsible for the auto pens in the EOs. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  They had a shadow cabinet and kept Joe in a real cabinet while Kamala was at the liquor [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  cabinet. Meanwhile, makes it raises the question. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=468.2s)]
*  Who signed the pardons? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=471.68s)]
*  Did Hunter Biden create and sign his own pardon? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  Because that is balls. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  But it's also illegal and it has to be stopped. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=481.12s)]
*  If you look at this celebrity filled cabinet, though, it basically is like a covers band [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=483.64s)]
*  of Trump. It's like, hey, he's on TV. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=489.2s)]
*  He's famous. He's got a name. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  Let's do what he does. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=493.0s)]
*  But it's like trying to create a human by pasting together body parts. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=494.24s)]
*  It doesn't make it alive. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=497.96s)]
*  It's still dead and you're still not doing the hard work, which is you have to change. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=499.4s)]
*  You have people to judge talking about the language, but they the Dems are focused on [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=505.28s)]
*  the language because they realize the substance underneath it is what people hate. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=509.84s)]
*  He talks about condescension. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=515.48s)]
*  OK, is there a condescending way, a non condescending way to deny a border, to deny [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=520.08s)]
*  biology, to deny government corruption, crime, vagrancy or spending into oblivion? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=526.12s)]
*  Is there a humble conversational way that you can attract men when you're talking about [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=530.96s)]
*  women with penises or men wanting to play women's sports or cutting up your kids in [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=536.36s)]
*  gender experiments? Is there some kind of non confrontational way that you can do that? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=541.84s)]
*  Because I'm all ears. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=546.04s)]
*  My point being is it doesn't matter what language you use. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=547.6s)]
*  It's the ideas under underneath it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  The Dems obsess over language because the ideas are so putrid. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=553.28s)]
*  A great idea requires fifth grade vocabulary. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=558.28s)]
*  A bad idea, a bad idea requires a teacher's lounge vocabulary. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=561.92s)]
*  A great idea could be monosyllabic, much like something that Jesse would understand. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=566.76s)]
*  Build the wall. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=571.8s)]
*  Yeah, build the wall. Exactly. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=573.64s)]
*  But if you're going to talk about boys playing and girls sports, man, you've got to call [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=575.52s)]
*  that teacher's lounge right up and get the right words. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=579.16s)]
*  The Dems are facing a huge cliff. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=582.08s)]
*  It's like it's like when you quit drugs or quit drinking. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=586.64s)]
*  What is my life going to be like without identity politics, without the oppression filter? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=589.2s)]
*  How do I look at issues when that thing isn't there? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=593.2800000000001s)]
*  How do I wake up in the morning and not look through this prism? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=596.2s)]
*  You've got to do it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=599.0400000000001s)]
*  I do. I know. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=600.32s)]
*  All right. Well, just do it a little bit more. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=601.76s)]
*  You just have vodka with breakfast. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=603.44s)]
*  Don't tell everyone about my regimen. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  What is in here anyway? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=607.96s)]
*  Everyone's been asking. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  I guess it's water. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=610.72s)]
*  How's Pete's beard doing? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=612.48s)]
*  I think Pete, we finally agree on the same things. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=614.76s)]
*  There's three things that he said. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  Really, we lost the trust of America right away as soon as the Biden administration took [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=620.24s)]
*  office. Closing down schools, he said, was a big problem. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=626.0400000000001s)]
*  And then he also said that you have to. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=630.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, gee, what did he say? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  Hold on. I got so lost up in the border. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  The border. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=638.4s)]
*  Everybody knew what was going on in their neighborhood. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=640.0s)]
*  They saw changes that they couldn't deal with. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=642.48s)]
*  And then also when they went to the grocery market and they saw that the eggs were too [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=645.48s)]
*  expensive or they went to fill up the gas in their car, it was too expensive. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=650.08s)]
*  The Democrats lost the country and those three issues right at the very beginning. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=654.6s)]
*  So again, that's the Democrats says we were right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=660.44s)]
*  Remember when the chief of staff said that inflation was a high class problem? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=663.32s)]
*  I mean, you don't get much more condescending than that condescension. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=668.6s)]
*  I hate that word. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=672.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=673.56s)]
*  It's almost as bad as tariff, right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=674.8399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=676.6s)]
*  Or punanarwa or memoir. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYumRdtsS8&t=677.04s)]
