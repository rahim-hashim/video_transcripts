# 'The Five': Trump dares Dems
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0)
*  Democrats are scrambling over how to respond to President Trump's bold strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=0.0s)]
*  but some critics are willing to give the president credit. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=5.14s)]
*  I find it hard to believe that Bush 41, Bush 43, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, you know, go down the list. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=9.52s)]
*  Any presidents wouldn't have felt compelled to take that strike. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=18.16s)]
*  This is about the best place we can be. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  I give extremely high marks to this national security team and President Trump for managing this crisis. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=27.08s)]
*  But the impeachment train is already leaving the station with AOC as its conductor. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=32.44s)]
*  President of the United States admitting that he unilaterally brought the United States into a war without congressional approval is a very grave public admission. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=38.12s)]
*  It is illegal. It is unconstitutional. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=51.64s)]
*  The usurpation of the war powers of Congress would be an impeachable offense, would be a high crime misdemeanor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=53.8s)]
*  If we do not take immediate action, he is a would be dictator who would become a dictator. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Guys, Congressman Al Green actually introducing articles of impeachment against Trump over the Iran strikes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=66.24s)]
*  A majority of Democrats joined Republicans to table the resolution, but only 79 Democrats were on board with Al Green. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=72.96s)]
*  President Trump, in the meantime, responding to AOC's call for impeachment, it's a doozy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  He said this. He called her one of the dumbest people in Congress. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=83.52s)]
*  He questioned her test scores, said she should be forced to take a cognitive exam and ended the epic and lengthy statement with this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=86.96s)]
*  Go ahead and try impeaching me again. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=94.72s)]
*  Make my day. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Emily, she has got to stop up talking if she wants to be taken seriously. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=100.2s)]
*  It's driving me nuts. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=104.28s)]
*  I know. And you know what drives me nuts further is how many people seem to not notice that and follow her anyway. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=105.04s)]
*  It kills me. Guys, I was particularly repulsed by Rep. Jasmine Crockett's comments where she said, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=110.12s)]
*  I'm the one that's supposed to make the f***ing decision on bombing Iran. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=117.72s)]
*  And it reinforced to me why that's exactly not the case. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=121.76s)]
*  We know that constitutionally that indeed it was reserved for the commander in chief for that reason that we see and at the time, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=126.0s)]
*  commander in chief of the Army and Navy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=133.4s)]
*  But for that reason, that that's the person elected by the people that we entrust those decisions to. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=134.72000000000003s)]
*  And I feel like, first of all, it's a pretty foul mouth of her for someone that went to a tidy little all girls Catholic school. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=138.96s)]
*  But that's what we're seeing is all of these representatives lashing out, trying to gain influence or attention. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=144.4s)]
*  And they're missing the whole point because they're not thinking about this critically or the gravitas that it deserves. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  And everyone trying to make the war powers the declaration thing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Anyone who has any semblance of history knows that there have been plenty of actions where you've not declared war. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  I time traveled back to 1787 and I looked up the the literal beginning U.S. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=162.88s)]
*  Constitution Convention notes and guys in the debates. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  So the phrase to declare war, it used to say make war and they actually specifically changed it to ensure the president could repel sudden attacks. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=171.76s)]
*  The executive should be able to repel sudden attacks, but the legislature should declare war. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=181.28s)]
*  That's exactly what this was. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=186.32s)]
*  This was a deterrent, decisive action with containment to protect American interests. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  And that's why it's the commander in chief that does that, not Crockett in chief. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  Jessie, she dropped some history there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  That's usually your role, but I will allow it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  In some ways, I think this kind of helps Trump because he's blessed with the worst opposition. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=202.52s)]
*  And every time they scream impeachment, it's like it has this law of diminishing returns. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  She went out and she'll fundraise off of that and make small dollar donations. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=213.44s)]
*  But I do think it strengthens Trump politically in the long run. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=217.12s)]
*  If they win the House, and that's a big if Harold, they're going to try to impeach him again. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=221.52s)]
*  They can't help themselves. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=227.16s)]
*  And Hakeem has no control over his caucus. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=228.72s)]
*  Nancy used to have control. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=231.88s)]
*  Everyone said the same thing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=233.28s)]
*  They were all on point. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=234.72s)]
*  Everyone's saying all these different things, each crazier than the next. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=236.16s)]
*  So we're going to have impeachment coverage in about two years. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=240.84s)]
*  And this is the place for it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=243.32s)]
*  When you saw Barack Obama eliminate Osama bin Laden, what I said at the time, because I'm a slick TV news host, is that Barack Obama didn't kill bin Laden. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=246.12s)]
*  The Seals did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=258.0s)]
*  And then I gave the Seals all the credit because I didn't. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  I wasn't man enough to give the president credit because I'm just a shallow cable host. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=262.84s)]
*  But why don't the Democrats do that? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=268.24s)]
*  Why don't they say, excellent job by the Air Force, amazing job by the Navy? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  This is what we love about this country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=276.68s)]
*  You don't even talk about the president. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=279.16s)]
*  Harold, I was never a politician. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  You're a recovering politician. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not that hard because when they start talking about usurping war powers authority and they talk about asking for permission, they don't sound like leaders. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=286.92s)]
*  They sound like lawyers. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=296.76s)]
*  And even Emily will realize that sounding like a lawyer is the worst thing to sound like. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=298.4s)]
*  Harold, your name was invoked. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=304.24s)]
*  I mean, you never call for impeachment. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=305.88s)]
*  You think this is crazy. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=307.4s)]
*  I know. But she does get a lot of attention and drives the news cycle. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=308.32s)]
*  Well, and we give it to her. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=312.64s)]
*  I think that she is not representative of where a lot of the country is. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=313.68s)]
*  And for that matter, where a lot of my party is, I think support for the president has been bipartisan. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=319.2s)]
*  We showed a display of Democrats who worked in previous administrations, Mr. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=323.72s)]
*  Obama's, Mr. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=328.8s)]
*  Biden's, Democrats who were praising with this administration, then more importantly, praising the choreography and execution of the mission. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=329.6s)]
*  There's been some dissent. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=337.92s)]
*  There's been dissent on the Republican side. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=338.88000000000005s)]
*  There's been dissent on the Democrat side. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=340.44000000000005s)]
*  I don't think anything is wrong with that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  I think where we have a challenge is when you is when you go overboard. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=343.36s)]
*  This was not an impeachable offense. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=347.16s)]
*  The president made a decision to protect and defend the country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=348.6s)]
*  You can think that he went overboard or the degree in which he tried to do it is questionable. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=351.56s)]
*  I don't. But I don't think that's an impeachable offense. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=355.72s)]
*  If indeed that is in every decision, the president makes that you disagree with that may or may not work is impeachable. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=358.04s)]
*  Finally, the the the War Powers Act allows for at least the way it's been interpreted on one or two occasions allows for the president to act defensively, to act when we have been attacked. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=363.88000000000005s)]
*  It does not in some people's minds allow him to act offensively. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=375.88s)]
*  I hope Tim Kaine, who I think has been the most genuine and consistent over the last many years because he's challenged Democrats and Republicans in their authority. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  And Jesse mentioned kind of I think in a flippant way, and I was glad to hear him say the way he said it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=387.88s)]
*  But sometimes we've reached a point where Democrats support Democrats when they do things, if they don't get the authorization and Republicans generally support Republicans. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=391.92s)]
*  I hope we can have a debate about the War Powers Act outside of the context of an imminent threat or, for that matter, imminent action on the part of the country, because I think the nation would do. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=399.32s)]
*  Would be best served to understand what it means to understand when when it is triggered. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=409.48s)]
*  And frankly, it'll help us to discern whether or not these crazy calls for impeachment or it's legal or unconstitutional, if indeed they have any credence. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=415.32s)]
*  I just want to point out that we aren't the only ones who are saying that the Democrats shouldn't go down this road here. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=424.4s)]
*  Charlemagne on this, Joey. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=429.96s)]
*  There have been a bunch of presidents who have ordered strikes without congressional approval. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=432.36s)]
*  Barack Obama did it against Libya. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=436.76s)]
*  Joe Biden ordered strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=438.92s)]
*  Bill Clinton did it for presidents ordering military action without congressional approval. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=443.24s)]
*  Has become pretty routine. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=447.04s)]
*  So why didn't it lead to impeachment for everybody else? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=448.2s)]
*  Like when Barack Obama did it, when Biden did it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=450.16s)]
*  But it has. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=452.08s)]
*  I mean, you fought under one of these scenarios. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=453.92s)]
*  The president needs to have that capability. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=458.0s)]
*  But Israel was telling our intelligence and they agreed was that the fuse had been lit. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  So you could argue that it was defensive. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=464.0s)]
*  Could you imagine Congress being the ones in the situation room at midnight hour, like trying to make a decision? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=466.08s)]
*  I mean, they race to the bottom on our budget every three months. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=472.56s)]
*  Like they can't decide anything. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=475.4s)]
*  My solution to this would be to take AOC, Jasmine Crockett, Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=476.96s)]
*  Maybe Thomas Massey is like the wild card and put them in like a house with a bunch of cameras and lock them off from the rest of the world. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=482.96s)]
*  And let them think they're fighting it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=489.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, like Gutfeld's game show. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=490.96s)]
*  And let them think they're fighting it out. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=494.0s)]
*  And they have to come to a consensus before they can leave that house. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=495.76000000000005s)]

*  Maybe even the rest of Congress can figure it out because that's what they want. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=502.92s)]
*  They want attention. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=506.32000000000005s)]

*  They want to raise money. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=510.32000000000005s)]

*  I think Lindsey Graham actually is a true believer of the policy he advocates. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=515.32s)]
*  Maybe that was unfair. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  But, you know, the idea here is AOC, I think, is a little bit wiser to the game than Jasmine Crockett. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=519.52s)]
*  AOC understands that her path to success is to be this reasonably sounding radical. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=525.88s)]
*  That people that don't pay attention to politics just kind of likes her vibe and wants to support her. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtOxfUniAe0&t=533.6s)]
