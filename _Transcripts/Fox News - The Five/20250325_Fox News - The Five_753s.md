# ‘The Five’ reacts to fallout from Signal group chat
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44)
*  President Trump and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz hitting back against a bombshell [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=0.0s)]
*  report earlier today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=5.38s)]
*  The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally added to a group chat with [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=6.84s)]
*  Trump cabinet members on the encrypted app Signal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=11.44s)]
*  Goldberg claims he was privy to minute-by-minute war plans about strikes to take out Houthi [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=14.48s)]
*  terrorists in Yemen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=19.56s)]
*  Trump and Waltz reacting earlier. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  The main thing was nothing happened. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=23.82s)]
*  The attack was totally successful. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  This was not classified. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=28.2s)]
*  Now, if it's classified information, it's probably a little bit different. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=29.2s)]
*  But I always say you have to learn from every experience. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=33.04s)]
*  I think it was very unfair the way they attacked Michael. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=36.08s)]
*  He's a good person. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=40.2s)]
*  The person that was on just happens to be a sleazebag. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=42.68s)]
*  Everybody else seems to be using it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=45.72s)]
*  It seems to be the number one used device or app. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=47.0s)]
*  Was up to me everybody would be sitting in a room together. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=50.8s)]
*  The room would have solid lead walls and a lead ceiling and a lead floor. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=54.12s)]
*  But you know, life doesn't always let you do that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=59.16s)]
*  I don't think he should apologize. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=61.36s)]
*  I think he's doing his best. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  It's equipment and technology that's not perfect. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=66.4s)]
*  I think there's a lot of the lessons. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of journalists in this city who have made big names for themselves making [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  up lies about this president. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=76.12s)]
*  We've never met, don't know, never communicated with. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=78.24s)]
*  We are looking into him reviewing how the heck he got into this room. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=81.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats and the media are demanding head's role for the mishap. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=87.4s)]
*  I was shocked and I really I was without words. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=92.04s)]
*  Texting war plans, it is something we've never quite seen before. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=96.4s)]
*  So simple, so easy, so sloppy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=100.76s)]
*  Obviously reckless, obviously dangerous. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=103.0s)]
*  It would be comical if it wasn't so serious and so dangerous. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=105.56s)]
*  It's in a completely reckless disregard for protocol. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=109.4s)]
*  Just shocking. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=112.84s)]
*  This sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=114.2s)]
*  It is so stunning and so incompetent and so dangerous. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=118.28s)]
*  My guess is that this is probably the tip of the iceberg. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=123.0s)]
*  What should happen here? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=125.64000000000001s)]
*  Should we be saying lock them up? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  And even Hillary Clinton is fuming over the story saying you've got to be kidding me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=129.56s)]
*  Jesse, I like the way the president handled it because I think on something like this, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  just take it head on, deal with it and say that obviously he's talked to everybody in the room [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=139.16s)]
*  and maybe we need a new way to communicate in the government. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Perhaps Elon Musk can help them with that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=147.4s)]
*  But I noted that somebody brought up yesterday, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=149.24s)]
*  Eric Swalwell is calling on these guys to resign. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=151.64s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's the best messenger after his troubles. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=155.0s)]
*  They sleep with spies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=159.32s)]
*  They let spies drive them around. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=160.44s)]
*  They keep classified documents and open garages while their crackhead son's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=162.68s)]
*  compromised by the Chinese and he's in and out of there with girlfriends at the dead of night. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=166.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=170.28s)]
*  Nobody died except for terrorists. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=171.72s)]
*  They accidentally put an American reporter on a group chat and not a good reporter, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=174.44s)]
*  not our very own stupid son of a bitch Peter Ducey. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=179.8s)]
*  They put on the worst reporter in Washington. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=182.12s)]
*  And he had the story for a week and then dropped it the day before. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=185.4s)]
*  Basically half the people on the group text testified. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  So you have that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=193.08s)]
*  But listen, it didn't look like anybody was too faced on the text. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=193.8s)]
*  Everybody was professional, thoughtful, America first. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  They were really wrestling with the question [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  over why is the United States insuring shipping for our allies that are screwing us on trade [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=205.08s)]
*  and not paying their NATO dues? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Why are they getting a free ride? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=213.4s)]
*  What are we getting in return? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=214.84s)]
*  And that's really going to be the question that America has to ask ourselves in the next 50 years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  But how do you get on the text? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  A staffer accidentally put him on the text. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  He wouldn't have sabotaged this and put this guy on the text on purpose, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=229.0s)]
*  but they'll investigate it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=234.68s)]
*  This is a very transparent administration. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=235.24s)]
*  And I really like what the president said. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=237.56s)]
*  He said we screwed up. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=240.52s)]
*  Won't happen again. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=240.84s)]
*  It's not like they had 13 people die and say it was a success [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  or just blow open the border, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=246.44s)]
*  get Americans killed and call it the most secure border ever. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=247.96s)]
*  But most importantly, Dana, I love the emoji game. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=251.96s)]
*  American flag, fire, fist bump, good stuff. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=257.08s)]
*  Richard, one thing about Goldberg is he waited, yes, until before the hearing, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=261.32s)]
*  but he also didn't do anything to disrupt the operation [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=267.16s)]
*  or the possible sources and methods of the people who might have been helping inform us [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=269.72s)]
*  to get that done appropriately. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=274.04s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=275.96s)]
*  And he also has not released money. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=276.76s)]
*  He hasn't seen screenshots. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=278.04s)]
*  I thought this was classified. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=280.28s)]
*  I left the chat because I was unsure what information I was receiving. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=281.32s)]
*  He did report it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=285.0s)]
*  And I think that's sort of noble of him. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=286.92s)]
*  Listen, I think that Mike Waltz might be a good guy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=288.28s)]
*  I can't attest to his character, but I do believe that this communication is indeed troubling, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=291.08s)]
*  that you have a lot of our top tier, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=298.84s)]
*  NAF security individuals on this chat, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  not sure who else is on this chat. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=304.36s)]
*  And to the president's point, he prefers it to happen in a room [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=306.12s)]
*  that has lead walls and a room that's more secure, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=308.6s)]
*  that there is one of those. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=311.72s)]
*  It's called the Situation Room. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=312.68s)]
*  And this conversation could have happened there, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=313.72s)]
*  or it could have happened in the S.K.I.F.T., a secure room. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=315.0s)]
*  There's tons of them around Washington, D.C. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=317.48s)]
*  Most of the buildings where these individuals manage their teams have a S.K.I.F. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=319.16s)]
*  They could have done this meeting in person at a S.K.I.F. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=323.48s)]
*  Beyond that, throughout our national security apparatus, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=325.72s)]
*  there's tons of different vehicles for this type of secure communications to happen [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=328.68s)]
*  outside of Signal, which all of us have on our phones right now. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=332.36s)]
*  So there's multiple different ways to do this conversation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=335.16s)]
*  So I think the reason why people are reacting the way they're reacting [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  is because they chose a retail app that everybody has on their phone [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=340.28s)]
*  instead of many of the other avenues that exist [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=343.8s)]
*  as part of the federal government apparatus to have this conversation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=346.76s)]
*  And I think the reason why folks are saying that maybe a hedge should roll [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=350.2s)]
*  is because during the Biden administration, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=353.4s)]
*  the Biden administration was critiqued for not firing people fast enough, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=355.4s)]
*  not saying people made a mistake and they should be let go. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=358.44s)]
*  And Donald Trump was sort of, I think he might have a copyright on, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=361.4s)]
*  you're fired. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=364.12s)]
*  Maybe you should use that copyright right now to say somebody should, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  even if it's a junior staffer for making a mistake like this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=367.32s)]
*  Because how about if it wasn't a journalist and it was somebody else [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=369.88s)]
*  who wants to compromise the United States? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=372.36s)]
*  And there's watching all of our top tier national security officials [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=374.2s)]
*  engage in a conversation about how to deal with our foreign allies [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=377.64s)]
*  or maybe not so our allies, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=381.24s)]
*  In this particular conversation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=383.08s)]
*  And that is what is indeed troubling to me. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=384.6s)]
*  I guess if you're a junior staffer and you do this [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=386.92s)]
*  and you have a security clearance, it might jeopardize your job. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=389.64s)]
*  It does jeopardize your job. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=392.92s)]
*  Yeah. And you might not be promoted and on and on. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=393.96s)]
*  So, Judge. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=396.6s)]
*  Okay. A couple of things. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  We're two months into this administration. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=399.24s)]
*  Okay. And what you have are people and what struck me [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=401.8s)]
*  is that what they were saying in this communication on Signal, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=406.92s)]
*  which is, I understand, the best of the encrypted communications [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  that you can get on a phone, is something that they're saying publicly. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=413.56s)]
*  And I think that Americans should be comforted by that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=418.04s)]
*  That they aren't saying one thing to the public [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=421.8s)]
*  and then going back behind walls and saying something different. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=424.28s)]
*  And it's what the president was saying. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=428.44s)]
*  I mean, the president has been saying, you know, the proxies have to go, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=430.11999999999995s)]
*  the Houthis have to go, Iran is behind it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  Everything that the president has been saying is what was in this communication. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=436.52s)]
*  And they talked about how the Houthis are tying up the trade [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=441.32s)]
*  and making it almost impossible for not just Americans, but for the Europeans. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=446.11999999999995s)]
*  But they were talking about when, not specific longitude and latitude [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=451.4s)]
*  and all that other stuff. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=457.32s)]
*  And they were smart enough to say, if you read the article, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=458.67999999999995s)]
*  that let's communicate on the high side, which meant that they recognized [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=462.84s)]
*  that when there were things that were classified, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=467.88s)]
*  they had to communicate via another instrument. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=470.2s)]
*  So, in addition to that, you know, Trump is clearly, as you said, Dana, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=473.4s)]
*  he's taking it seriously. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=478.28s)]
*  We're going to learn from it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=479.96s)]
*  Nothing shared was classified. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=481.4s)]
*  The strikes were successful. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=483.47999999999996s)]
*  No one was hurt. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=485.32s)]
*  And the truth is that for four years, Biden allowed our soldiers [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=486.52s)]
*  to be hit by the Houthis. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=490.52s)]
*  Several died. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=492.35999999999996s)]
*  Many are suffering from lifelong traumatic brain injuries. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=493.64s)]
*  And we're seeing transparency in a way that is, I think, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  people should be comforted by. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=501.88s)]
*  And in the end, let's make it clear that this particular writer [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=503.64s)]
*  is the one who we know lied about Donald Trump. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  And so I'm not impressed with him at all. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=512.28s)]
*  And I like that the president stood up for Mike Walz. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=514.76s)]
*  I like that he said, this is a guy who believes in the country, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=517.64s)]
*  he's working hard, and we're going to keep him. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=520.28s)]
*  And we all learned. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=522.36s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld, last word. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=524.28s)]
*  Well, this was bound to happen. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=526.52s)]
*  There's so many great things happening so fast at blinding speed. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  It's overwhelming to the media. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=534.92s)]
*  It's overwhelming to a lot of people that you almost needed [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=536.52s)]
*  just a misstep to keep the media from committing suicide. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=540.28s)]
*  Because now they can act like what they really are, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=543.8s)]
*  hand-wringing journalists. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=546.12s)]
*  God forbid that they would report on the good things that are going on. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=547.96s)]
*  They suddenly discovered their vocation. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  When a story, as always, is delivered to them in their laps, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=555.0s)]
*  and it's not about Democrats, suddenly, they get up from their desks, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=559.64s)]
*  they stop doom scrolling and report the news. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=564.68s)]
*  I think there's a key point that has been overlooked. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  Wasn't it preloaded on their phone? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=572.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=575.16s)]
*  Okay, so what does that tell you? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=575.56s)]
*  There's no secure government alternative to Signal. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=576.5999999999999s)]
*  There isn't a way for a dozen people to talk on their own timeline, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=579.2399999999999s)]
*  i.e. group chat, as we kids like to call it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  That's secure. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=586.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, why is it on the phone? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=588.28s)]
*  Do you, I mean, Trump said, yeah, in the perfect world, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  you'd have it in this, you know, separate room, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=593.16s)]
*  but that doesn't exist if you have 12 people all over the place. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=596.68s)]
*  But here's the bigger context. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=600.28s)]
*  When you have a high, the highest possible goal, your aim, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  and you choose to act on that aim, you incur a risk for error. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=606.52s)]
*  That's just, that's how winners live their lives. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=610.28s)]
*  But you can avoid that risk for error by doing nothing. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=613.8s)]
*  Like what Biden did with the border, no act, no foul. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=618.04s)]
*  Like, it has been the bone of contention under Trump. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  They don't go after his aims because they fall in line with America's aims, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=625.88s)]
*  so they go after the process. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=629.7199999999999s)]
*  He's going too fast. It's too sloppy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=630.92s)]
*  That's because Trump does more stuff in a day than Biden did in his career. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=632.92s)]
*  So for mistakes to happen, you have to act on an aim, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=637.64s)]
*  and you have to have a will to act on it, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=640.28s)]
*  which was missing the last four years. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=641.88s)]
*  Thousands of errors Biden didn't make, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=643.8s)]
*  because the White House was one giant deliberate act of negligence. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=647.16s)]
*  You know, they didn't seal the border. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=652.6s)]
*  They didn't reduce crime. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=654.52s)]
*  They didn't get men out of women's sports. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=655.7199999999999s)]
*  They didn't fight inflation. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=657.48s)]
*  No act, no foul, right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=659.0799999999999s)]
*  Perhaps we were lucky that they ignored the problems. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=661.16s)]
*  It could have been worse. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=663.16s)]
*  But Biden made no mistake capturing the Abbey Gate bomber because he didn't try. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, he didn't make any mistakes trying to capture [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=670.28s)]
*  America's 10 most wanted criminals because they didn't try. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  He didn't make any mistakes when it came to deporting gangs because he didn't try. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=676.44s)]
*  So for the next four years, you will hear of mistakes being made. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=682.2s)]
*  Left and right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=686.76s)]
*  Big ones, little ones. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=687.72s)]
*  Because the aims of the White House are so good, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=689.24s)]
*  all you have left as an angry media is to go after the process. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=693.0s)]
*  But Americans know the choice. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=697.96s)]
*  Do you want a leader with noble aims who will take a risk in the name of America first, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=699.96s)]
*  there might be some mistakes made, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=706.2800000000001s)]
*  or do you want a leader who did nothing but oversee the decline of a country, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=708.12s)]
*  a charade that was collaborated on by the very outraged media that you're seeing now? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  What they did under Biden makes this signal thing look like a pimple on an aunt's ass. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=721.96s)]
*  I would say they actually did do one thing. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=729.4000000000001s)]
*  They caused inflation. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=731.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  By passing the so-called Inflation Reduction Act and adding the Green New Deal to it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=734.04s)]
*  Good point, Dana. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=737.7199999999999s)]
*  Which we are still paying for. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAHbdqZh44&t=738.1999999999999s)]
