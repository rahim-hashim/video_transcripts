# Greg Gutfeld: El Salvador has become Democrats' new ‘Epstein Island’
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c)
*  The Democrats are sure spending a lot of their political capital fighting for the rights [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=0.0s)]
*  of foreigners. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=4.46s)]
*  The latest political pilgrimage was to an ICE facility in Louisiana. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=5.46s)]
*  Five Democratic lawmakers trying to visit the two graduate students who were arrested [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=9.16s)]
*  by federal immigration officials. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=13.46s)]
*  They are facing potential removal from the United States over what officials claim is [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=15.64s)]
*  their role in instigating anti-Israel protests on campus. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=20.06s)]
*  This is not immigration enforcement. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=25.18s)]
*  This is stifling dissent. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=27.64s)]
*  This is repression. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=30.34s)]
*  This is authoritarianism. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=32.24s)]
*  Mahmoud and Ramisa are political prisoners. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=34.24s)]
*  She was abducted, kidnapped in broad daylight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=37.44s)]
*  This could be you for practicing diversity, equity and inclusion. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=41.44s)]
*  This could be you for reading a banned book. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=45.16s)]
*  Now that comes hot on the heels of the El Salvador Four going to bat for suspected MS-13 [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=47.68s)]
*  gang member, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=52.88s)]
*  The National Republican Senatorial Committee is having some fun at the Democrats' expense, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=54.96s)]
*  but putting out this fake travel ad. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=59.36s)]
*  Welcome to El Salvador, home to breathtaking sunsets and gang banger Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=62.32s)]
*  So what are you waiting for Senate Democrats? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=69.76s)]
*  Step into the rhythm of rescue. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  All right, so that's an attempt at humor. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=74.48s)]
*  What do you think of the claim by, like, for example, Congresswoman Presley saying, next [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=78.92s)]
*  it's you, next it's books, next it's everything, next it's- [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=83.84s)]
*  That's what they always say about everything. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  And yet they're the ones that are always pushing and oppressing us, wanting to experiment on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  kids. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  What's next after that? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  El Salvador has become the Democrats' new Epstein Island. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, instead of getting a massage from a sex worker, they're getting photo ops with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=102.64s)]
*  their pimp. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=107.12s)]
*  You know, if they keep flocking to El Salvador, it's just they're just going to incentivize [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=108.12s)]
*  us to send more illegals there because then it's basically a twofer. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  The illegals go there and then so do the Democrats. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  So just keep doing it nonstop. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=122.2s)]
*  Keep them busy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=124.44s)]
*  The Dems are demanding a solution to a problem that they created. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=125.44s)]
*  They lost that privilege and their solution is designed to be impossible. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=129.92s)]
*  You can't vet everybody. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=134.04s)]
*  You know, they claim that you have to vet each deportation, something they never asked [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=135.92s)]
*  of Obama, yet they believe that vetting those that came in is somehow inhumane. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=140.56s)]
*  So how is vetting when somebody coming in is an injustice and vetting when they leave [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  is justice? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  When if you had vetted at the beginning, we wouldn't be having this discussion and I would [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=151.88000000000002s)]
*  be home getting a massage from Andre, who is from Guatemala. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=156.08s)]
*  Are there any bad guys, I wonder, Harold, that the Dems won't defend? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=160.68s)]
*  You know, is Jeffrey Dahmer actually an environmentalist who was reducing our carbon footprint? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  Was Charles Manson kind of like a misunderstood defender of family values? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  Was Bin Laden a Saudi influencer and doting grandfather? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, just stay on your phone, Harold. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=179.08s)]
*  I'm listening to you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  Harold, I'll turn to you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=183.36s)]
*  Your name was invoked. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  So a couple of things here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=186.94s)]
*  Democrats, Republicans, Americans have every right to talk about due process. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=189.72000000000003s)]
*  I think sentimentally, everything that President Trump is doing as it relates to trying to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=195.6s)]
*  send people back and actually sending people back to their country of origin, if they have [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=200.4s)]
*  committed a crime, I think Mr. Holman said it best at the outset of the administration [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=205.68s)]
*  when he said we're going to employ a worst first strategy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=209.16s)]
*  And I think the American people are in support of it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=213.56s)]
*  We often cite polls here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=216.0s)]
*  Three out of five Americans don't believe we should be sending back migrants or immigrants [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=217.28s)]
*  who are here waiting for their status to be approved or disapproved if they haven't [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=221.76s)]
*  committed crimes and they're paying taxes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=225.44s)]
*  One box. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=228.04s)]
*  Two, the court is ultimately going to decide this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=229.04s)]
*  And interestingly, the Supreme Court has spoken most forcefully in the last few days saying [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  that President Trump could not invoke the act that he's used to send these people to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=235.84s)]
*  El Salvador to send another group of people, a group of men who are alleged to be members [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=240.12s)]
*  of this gang without some due process. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=245.2s)]
*  Now, the court is ultimately going to decide, the Supreme Court, what due process rights [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=248.8s)]
*  do noncitizens have, whether they are here legally waiting for their status to be either [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  revoked or accepted or they're here legally without any papers saying they're allowed [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=260.88s)]
*  to be here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=265.04s)]
*  That, to me, is what will decide this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=266.04s)]
*  And President Trump, we will all have to abide by it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, we often, I don't, but some people I know often cite judges and whom they've been [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  appointed by. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=275.44s)]
*  I would remind everyone around this table that a 7-2 decision came down from the Supreme [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=276.44s)]
*  Court, staying something the president wanted to have happen. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=279.92s)]
*  And the majority, in fact, all of the people that President Trump appointed to the Supreme [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=284.68s)]
*  Court voted in the majority, and that's 7-2. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=289.2s)]
*  So I'm interested in the politics around this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  It's curious. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't disagree with some of the sentiment around the table and what President Trump [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  is trying to do. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=298.88s)]
*  I think some are just saying do it in a way that is consistent with our laws. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=299.88s)]
*  And ultimately, perhaps in the next two or three weeks, if not sooner, the court is going [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  Supreme Court, what rights do those who are illegal or who are here waiting for their [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=307.6s)]
*  status to be approved or not approved versus those of us who are American citizens? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  That's the key legal question. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=317.16s)]
*  I'd be curious to hear how the judge contemplates this issue as well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=318.16s)]
*  Well, Judge, the deportations are still President Trump's number one issue that people approve [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=322.24s)]
*  of, and that hasn't shifted despite the whole Abrego Garcia case. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=327.04s)]
*  Well, because most of it is not real. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  It's like the weapon hoax. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=333.68s)]
*  It's like the Russian collusion hoax. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  It's like BLM, we have to raise money so we can give it to kids in inner city when it [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=337.44s)]
*  was for a pyramid and for people to buy homes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  None of this is real. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=344.92s)]
*  Here's the bottom line. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  The Alien Enemies Act is still in effect. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=348.04s)]
*  What the Supreme Court has said is that Mahmoud Khalil was, not Mahmoud, Rao Garcia in El [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=352.68s)]
*  Salvador, was found to be a proper target of deportation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=361.44s)]
*  The only issue was the withholding order. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=365.92s)]
*  The withholding order, again, I will repeat myself, is only because as a member of MS-13, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=368.32s)]
*  he had enemies in El Salvador who want to kill him and therefore there was a whole order [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=374.48s)]
*  to not send him there because as a gang member, he'd be killed by the other gang members. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=379.12s)]
*  That's the only issue with Abrego Garcia. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=383.68s)]
*  Let's talk about people who are being swept off the street. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=385.76s)]
*  Whether it is the Mahmoud Khalil or Ramez El-Zerk, these people do not have a right to be here. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=389.12s)]
*  If they had been honest in the first place, they would never have gotten a visa. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=396.88s)]
*  If they said we were going to come here because we hate you, we hate the Jews, we're pro-Hamas, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=400.56s)]
*  we're pro-foreign terrorist organizations, they would never be allowed in. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  What we have right now are these people in Louisiana in a holding center, which is where [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=410.64s)]
*  they have a right to be, habeas corpus. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=415.76s)]
*  The Democrats are going to visit them down south, going to El Salvador down south. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=418.08s)]
*  They never went down south to make sure the border was secure and now they want to go [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=421.92s)]
*  into the prisons to make sure that these people who don't have a right to be here [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=426.48s)]
*  get the right medication. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=431.84s)]
*  When's the last time they were in a prison taking care of American prisoners, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=433.2s)]
*  black prisoners, poor prisoners? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=436.88s)]
*  I'm done with this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=438.88s)]
*  Well, I'm not going, but that's not the question. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=439.76s)]
*  That's what about the Supreme Court decision relating to those swept up. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=441.2s)]
*  Those are two different cases. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=445.2s)]
*  The court said- [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=446.32s)]
*  There are two cases. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=446.88s)]
*  There is a brego El Salvador and then there are the defendants who are swept up under [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  the passport visa. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=453.76s)]
*  You don't have a right in either place. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay, but there are three. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=458.4s)]
*  I'm talking about a different case to court. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  Which case are you talking about? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  The Supreme Court, they were about to ship another group of people back to El Salvador. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=460.96s)]
*  But they want to give them due process. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=466.4s)]
*  Everybody says they're entitled to due process. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=468.08s)]
*  But this is the Supreme Court of the United States, not me. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  And I've never been down to any of these prisons. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  There'll be a judicial decision soon. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=474.72s)]
*  That would be good. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=476.32s)]
*  But also I asked Tom Homan this morning, Jesse, about would it help if President Trump [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=476.88s)]
*  had the Congress weighing in on this whole deportation thing about like, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=481.92s)]
*  do you have to have everybody go through a court thing? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  You know, the Congress could act here and it might be interesting to me to put the Democrats [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  on the defense. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  Republicans control the Congress so they should do it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=496.8s)]
*  Well, that's what I said. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=499.6s)]
*  You saw Tom this morning? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=501.04s)]
*  Tom Homan? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  That's not your masseuse, Andre. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=504.8s)]
*  Not Tom. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=506.48s)]
*  It's a different guy. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=506.98s)]
*  I'm not going to rely on the Congress. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=509.12s)]
*  If they can get it done like that, sure. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=510.48s)]
*  But it takes them years to do anything. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=512.24s)]
*  Both parties use fear, Dana. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  Trump actually points to real stuff. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=516.48s)]
*  He's like, yeah, this jogger got raped by an illegal. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=518.16s)]
*  This guy got killed by Chinese fentanyl. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=520.64s)]
*  This lady got pushed into the subway. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=522.88s)]
*  The Democrats ask you to use your imagination. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=525.28s)]
*  And we're tired of it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  We don't have to worry about, oh, in 12 years the earth's going to warm. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=529.84s)]
*  So we all sizzle on the sidewalk. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=533.52s)]
*  Oh, MS-13 is getting deported. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=535.52s)]
*  I'm next. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=537.92s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=538.8s)]
*  No one needs to imagine anything when the real fear is right here. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=540.64s)]
*  And if they keep propping up these people that keep getting exposed as bad hombres, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=546.0s)]
*  what do you think this other guy in jail is like? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=551.04s)]
*  You think he's a saint? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=553.04s)]
*  He's obviously not. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=554.0s)]
*  When they told me Tim Walz was masculine and that Dylan Mulvaney was a dude, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=555.52s)]
*  everybody they put out, you can't trust. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=560.96s)]
*  Basically, the American people are at this point now, Dana, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=563.92s)]
*  where it's like everything the Democrats and the media say at best is half true [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=566.24s)]
*  because they have a horrible track record. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=572.4s)]
*  Why do they do this? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=575.52s)]
*  Because they only have one storyline. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=576.72s)]
*  And the storyline is anti-Trump. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  It's been the same storyline for the last decade. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=579.92s)]
*  So you now have Democrats in the media like Twister, red hand on, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=583.36s)]
*  hand on yellow, left hand on green. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=589.12s)]
*  And they're contorted into a knot. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=592.0s)]
*  And at this point, they are about to collapse. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=594.08s)]
*  Kaboom. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=597.28s)]
*  Just played Twister last night. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=597.92s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=599.52s)]
*  I don't think we need to know. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=601.2s)]
*  It wasn't Naked Twister, Dana. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=603.2s)]
*  Up next, even Dwight from The Office gets why people don't trust the media. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxGLG-TJF3c&t=605.6s)]
