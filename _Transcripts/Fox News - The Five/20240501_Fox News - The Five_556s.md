# Gutfeld: There's a larger force at play here
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0)
*  Think these pro-Hamas students are crazy? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=0.0s)]
*  Just wait until Joe Biden dumps the real thing in your town. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=2.94s)]
*  The Biden administration is considering [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=7.36s)]
*  welcoming certain Palestinians to the U.S. as refugees. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=9.52s)]
*  Keep this in mind. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Egypt and other Arab countries have been unwilling [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=15.48s)]
*  to take them in. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=18.56s)]
*  Here is the White House today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=20.04s)]
*  We are constantly evaluating policy proposals [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=22.92s)]
*  to further support Palestinians [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  who are family members of American citizens [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=27.56s)]
*  and may want to come to the United States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=30.16s)]
*  So we're evaluating it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=32.72s)]
*  I don't have anything to announce at this time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=33.8s)]
*  Biden's plan to take in Palestinian refugees [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=36.92s)]
*  is no doubt an appeasement to the squad. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  The merry band of radical lawmakers were outraged [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=42.96s)]
*  by the police crackdown on anti-Semitic students [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=45.96s)]
*  at Columbia. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=48.72s)]
*  AOC was lobbing threats at Mayor Eric Adams saying, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=50.08s)]
*  if any kid is hurt tonight, responsibility will fall [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=54.88s)]
*  on the mayor and university presidents. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=59.24s)]
*  And her comrades are also seething. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=62.28s)]
*  The state sanctioned violence, including the arrests [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=66.52s)]
*  and threatened felony prosecutions of students [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=69.0s)]
*  can only be seen as an explicit effort to silence students [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=72.0s)]
*  and take away their First Amendment rights. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=75.44s)]
*  The anti-Semitism bill that Mike Lawler has, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=77.6s)]
*  has a definition that is so broad [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=80.16s)]
*  that many of the Jewish groups like J Street [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  and Nexus and others cannot support. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=86.68s)]
*  So why would you do that, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  except if you want to weaponize anti-Semitism [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=92.28s)]
*  and you want to use it as a political ploy? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=95.64s)]
*  You know, Jesse, the biggest, or one of the biggest issues, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  one of the biggest two issues in this country right now [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=102.88s)]
*  is immigration. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=105.08s)]
*  And Joe Biden believes that the way to solve it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  is to bring in more Palestinians [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=108.88s)]
*  when their own, the people in Egypt and Jordan [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=111.64s)]
*  and Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=115.24s)]
*  will not refuse actually to take them in. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=118.68s)]
*  If you've seen the polling on Palestinians, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=122.56s)]
*  they support, they support October 7th, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=125.24s)]
*  they support 9-11, it's like a ticking time bomb. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=129.2s)]
*  Of course, Joe Biden says, come on in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=132.08s)]
*  Now, Judge, if someone steals my car [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=134.36s)]
*  and they go on a joy ride, I call 911 [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=136.88s)]
*  and I say, this is what the suspect looked like, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=139.56s)]
*  this is what my car-making model is, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=142.4s)]
*  this is the last date and time I saw the car. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't call them and say, you know what, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=147.68s)]
*  can you please not do any foot pursuits, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=149.52s)]
*  please don't have any high-speed chases. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=153.08s)]
*  And when you pull the guy out of the car, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=155.88s)]
*  if he resists arrest, just let him go. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=157.44s)]
*  No, I want my car back. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=159.68s)]
*  I don't try to tell the cop to deescalate, okay? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=161.68s)]
*  These people are adults, they can vote, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  they can have abortions, they can have sex changes, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=167.28s)]
*  they can drive, they can own homes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=170.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, they're saying, oh no, no, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=172.2s)]
*  they're snowflakes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=174.6s)]
*  They were arguing they weren't snowflakes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=175.92s)]
*  Now, all of a sudden, they just shape shifted [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=177.56s)]
*  in January 6th into this building, they smash windows. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=180.04s)]
*  They had anarchists pile in through windows [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=183.56s)]
*  and hold hostages. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=186.78s)]
*  They should be treated like adults, not snowflakes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=188.12s)]
*  All right, Kevin, you're a money guy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=191.6s)]
*  Joe Biden is gonna have to throw a lot of money in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  if he's going to bring these Palestinians in. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=196.68s)]
*  And the truth is, we already know that the minority [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=199.32s)]
*  community, veterans in those towns where these illegals [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=201.76s)]
*  are being brought in, although these would be called [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=205.6s)]
*  refugees, the minorities are suffering. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=207.52s)]
*  The veterans are suffering, subjugated to the illegals. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=210.2s)]
*  I think this pushes back up to the top three issues [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=214.58s)]
*  of the election, both border security and immigration [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=217.94s)]
*  policy, I mean, there's no question, this is like [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=221.36s)]
*  another throw-a-log on the fire on this issue, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=223.48s)]
*  because in places like here in New York, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=226.4s)]
*  you've seen what's happened with immigration [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  forced on these counties or cities or hotels. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  In other states as well, certainly San Francisco, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  southern states, Texas, they don't have the infrastructure [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=239.4s)]
*  to support all these people. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=241.96s)]
*  You gotta have that in place first before you bring [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=243.22000000000003s)]
*  anybody anywhere, because if you don't provide them a job, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  you don't provide them social services, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=249.16000000000003s)]
*  and they have nowhere to live, they're not that happy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  And bad things happen. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=253.88000000000002s)]
*  And so why do that to yourself until you've figured out [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=255.28s)]
*  how to solve for the existing problems [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=258.68s)]
*  this country has right now and border security? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=261.08s)]
*  I guarantee you this will be a top three election issue. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=263.8s)]
*  Watch it happen, we're only months away, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=268.36s)]
*  but this just adds fuel to that fire. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=270.88s)]
*  You know, Dana, we just heard Talib complain that arrests [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=274.84s)]
*  and threats of felony prosecution are efforts [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=278.96s)]
*  to silence these protesters and take away [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=282.88s)]
*  their First Amendment rights. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  This woman is in Congress, does she understand [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=288.56s)]
*  what the law is in this country? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  Clearly not, clearly not. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=293.24s)]
*  I mean, the First Amendment is first for a reason, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  and it makes a lot of sense for that, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=297.2s)]
*  but as soon as you cross the line into making sure [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  that nobody else can go to class, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  then you have infringed on their First Amendment rights. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  So no, she doesn't understand that at all. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=305.76s)]
*  The other thing is, last night I got home in time [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=308.2s)]
*  to watch Brett Baer's panel, so he's doing the news, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=310.44s)]
*  he's about to ask a question, he goes, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  Wait, this just in, let me see if I can read this right. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=315.16s)]
*  The CBS News reporting that the Biden administration [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=318.96s)]
*  is gonna let in all the Gazan refugees, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=322.08s)]
*  and he's like, let me read that again, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=325.0s)]
*  because it was just like, honestly, today, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=326.36s)]
*  this is the day that you're going to choose to say this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=328.62s)]
*  You never hear any of the protesters chant, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=330.64s)]
*  free Palestinians from Hamas. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=334.68s)]
*  Most Palestinians, yes, they believe all those things, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=338.08s)]
*  but they also don't wanna be governed by Hamas anymore. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=340.08s)]
*  And I also would say this, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  I think that Joe Biden's decision making [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=344.32s)]
*  and the slowness of it, and he hamstrung the Israelis [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=346.44s)]
*  from doing what they needed to do [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  to get this done more quickly. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=352.06s)]
*  That's the same thing that happened in Ukraine. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=354.0s)]
*  So then it gets that much harder, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=355.88s)]
*  and you're making them have to do everything [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=357.68s)]
*  much more slowly, so then these protests continue. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  This could have been taken care of before, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=362.54s)]
*  but the administration was like, no, no, hold off. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=364.68s)]
*  And the last thing I would say is, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  the pro-Hamas folks are saying [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=369.44s)]
*  that they want protection here in America [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=371.96s)]
*  from, they don't want to be infringed upon [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=374.2s)]
*  with their First Amendment rights, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=377.0s)]
*  they don't wanna go to jail, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=378.5s)]
*  they don't wanna be penalized, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=379.56s)]
*  but they also wanna be free to say to Jews, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  go back to Poland, while the Gazans get to come here. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  You know what, Greg, in Axios today, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  there was an article that the Dems [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=391.44s)]
*  are internally in panic mode, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=393.2s)]
*  because they know that bringing in the Gazans, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=395.88s)]
*  and they know that the silence of the administration, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=398.56s)]
*  as they were yelling death to Jews, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=402.88s)]
*  and from the river to the sea, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=404.72s)]
*  it's not just making the Jews angry, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=408.0s)]
*  it's making Americans angry. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=409.8s)]
*  Yeah, and also, I mean, you might have real asylum seekers, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=411.72s)]
*  but that doesn't matter, because this country, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=416.12s)]
*  I don't trust this country, and I don't mean Palestine, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=419.36s)]
*  I mean America, we can't vet a paper bag. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=422.12s)]
*  Look at our border, and look at the asylum process, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=425.64s)]
*  which has been corrupted. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=428.32s)]
*  You know, it's amazing that we're actually saying [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=429.88s)]
*  the phrase pro-Hamas movement, it is incredible, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=432.44s)]
*  and when you talk about those phrases, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=436.12s)]
*  almost everyone, I would say almost everybody [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=438.08s)]
*  was revolts by October 7th, but over time, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=440.8s)]
*  forces, both seen and unseen, have diluted it, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=444.78s)]
*  and changed it so that you have pro-Hamas protests, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=448.36s)]
*  where Israel's supporters are called genocidal. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=451.94s)]
*  And if you want to see how October 7th was possible, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  and I think this is the unintended consequence [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=459.88s)]
*  of these protests, is that you're reminded of October 7th [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=463.24s)]
*  when you look at the faces of those protesters, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=467.24s)]
*  their chants, the hate in their eyes. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=469.96000000000004s)]
*  They're not raping or killing yet, but you look at it, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=472.8s)]
*  you look at the blind ideological hate, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=477.32000000000005s)]
*  and you go, you know what, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=480.12s)]
*  now I can see how this is possible. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  We've been told that there's a global infantata, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=482.78s)]
*  and we see the professional signs in the tents, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=485.65999999999997s)]
*  the multiple actions across the United States, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=488.82s)]
*  highly organized and synchronized. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=491.61999999999995s)]
*  When are the patient Jewish left-wingers [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=494.32s)]
*  gonna speak out instead of sitting this out? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=497.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, when Trump called out Jewish leaders, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=500.05999999999995s)]
*  they claimed he was attacking them, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=503.11999999999995s)]
*  but when protesters say kill the Jews [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=505.23999999999995s)]
*  or go back to the ovens, they never use the word attack. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=507.29999999999995s)]
*  In fact, they rarely report it at all. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=511.36s)]
*  Remember if you said white lives matter? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=513.12s)]
*  If you said white lives matter, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=515.96s)]
*  you were called a white supremacist by the ADL. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=517.92s)]
*  By the ADL. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=522.12s)]
*  Yet if you say death to the Jews, death to the Zionists, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  there's no brown supremacy, no one's saying that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=526.92s)]
*  This is a very telling discrepancy, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=530.64s)]
*  and it tells you that there's a larger force at play. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=532.58s)]
*  The interesting thing is that Biden's approval [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=537.4s)]
*  on the Gaza war is 28%, 71% disapproval. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=540.72s)]
*  So there you have it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L5uZnysYd0&t=545.84s)]
