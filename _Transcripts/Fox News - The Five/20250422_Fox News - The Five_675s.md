# 'The Five' unpacks the Supreme Court LGBTQ books: 'VERY SIMPLE QUESTION'
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU)
*  A jam-packed day of news just moments ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=0.0s)]
*  AJS Secretary R.F.K. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=4.88s)]
*  Jr. going to war against artificial food dyes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=6.88s)]
*  Gavin Newsom is putting his own party on blast in a brand new interview, but first to a monumental [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=10.24s)]
*  Supreme Court case on parental rights. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=15.52s)]
*  The top court hearing oral arguments on whether elementary schools can force kids to read [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  books on gender and sexuality. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=23.56s)]
*  The [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=26.24s)]
*  Then, a group of parents responded with a lawsuit claiming their religious rights had [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=34.599999999999994s)]
*  been violated. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  Some are Muslim or Christian. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=38.8s)]
*  Earlier I spoke with one of those parents. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=40.68s)]
*  It was not merely reading, it was instruction, and you can find in the court documents how [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=43.76s)]
*  teachers and principals were instructed on how to approach the children and instruct [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=50.68s)]
*  the children with a very one-sided answer and approach to any questions that would come [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=56.44s)]
*  naturally from the children when these heavy topics are introduced. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=63.56s)]
*  And it's looking likely that the Supreme Court will side with the parents after the justices [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=67.84s)]
*  seem taken aback by the content in these books. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=72.68s)]
*  I too was struck by, these are, you know, young kids, picture books, and on matters concerning [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=76.96s)]
*  sexuality. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  I suspect there are a lot of non-religious parents who weren't all that thrilled about [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  this and then you, you know, add in religion and that's, you know, even more serious. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=90.52s)]
*  Judge Jeanine, the lower courts sided with the teachers union. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=100.24s)]
*  And not the parents, which by the time this gets to the Supreme Court, I imagine that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=106.12s)]
*  even Elena Kagan was thinking, why in the world did this ever get to us in the first [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=109.76s)]
*  place? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  It's obvious. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the federal appeals court ruled that the school can withdraw parents' right to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  opt their child out of this clearly sexual, transgender picture book for young children. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=120.4s)]
*  And the issue is, you know, parental rights as it relates to schools. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=128.52s)]
*  Parents have a parental right and a constitutional right, but they don't have a right to control [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=133.08s)]
*  everything that goes on in the school. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=139.36s)]
*  This case will be a very important case to define ultimately what control parents have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=141.96s)]
*  as it relates to the school curriculum. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  You know, and we've seen this tug of war start over the last going on over the last few years [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=150.36s)]
*  specifically, but I mean, it started in 1925 when the court ruled states can't force children [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=155.12s)]
*  to attend only public schools when parents wanted their kids to go to religious schools. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  And we just keep defining it and defining it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=165.64s)]
*  But I think that the argument that the schools are using is pretty bizarre. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  They're saying that they want to be able to instruct these children about these books, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  not just read, but instruct because, quote, diversity is strength. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  Inclusivity is promise. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=182.64s)]
*  And every child deserves an education that invites the truth. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=183.92s)]
*  But I as a parent should have the right to say I do not want my child exposed to any [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=188.42s)]
*  kind of ideology of gay or lesbian sexuality, irrespective of whether it violates my constitutional [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=193.88s)]
*  beliefs as a parent. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=201.26s)]
*  So let's leave religion out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=202.94s)]
*  So the question, I think, is going to be a very simple one where the courts are going [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  to say you can opt out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  But that's why Dana right now in this country, 29 states and the District of Columbia have [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=210.66s)]
*  school voucher programs so that parents don't have to deal with this nonsense of being called [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=216.82s)]
*  white supremacists and racist because they don't want their five-year-old to be shown [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=222.85999999999999s)]
*  how boys have sex with each other. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=228.38s)]
*  This is bizarre. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=231.14s)]
*  Jesse, even the other justices also seemed a little taken aback by the content. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=232.14s)]
*  But in their brief, the school district said it's just merely to introduce the concept. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  And the parents are saying, no, that's what we can do that at home. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=245.88s)]
*  We don't need to do that in the classroom between 3 and 10. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=248.08s)]
*  I'm going to teach gay sex to your six-year-old whether you like it or not is a powerful argument [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=251.0s)]
*  to the Supreme Court, maybe the most perverted argument the Supreme Court has ever heard. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=255.76s)]
*  Judge, can Justice Alito set these lawyers on fire? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=261.12s)]
*  I don't think it's a good idea. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=264.68s)]
*  OK, probably not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=265.68s)]
*  Can he call Chris Hansen to catch a predator? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=266.68s)]
*  Because this is a confession. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=269.02s)]
*  These people in Montgomery County are sick. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=270.68s)]
*  Look at these titles, Dana, Pride Puppy, Uncle Bobby's Wedding. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  I did a deep dive. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=279.84s)]
*  It's more than just gay romance. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=281.44s)]
*  Drag queens, F is for feather boa, I is for intersex. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=284.08s)]
*  And they've managed to do something no one's ever done in the history of civilization, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=289.68s)]
*  unite Jews, Muslims, and Catholics together under one banner. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=292.88s)]
*  Now when all of these people have fought wars and killed each other for centuries, maybe [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=297.84s)]
*  you realize you're doing something wrong. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=302.32s)]
*  You're right. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=305.04s)]
*  The teachers now have this guidance session where they will facilitate the conversation [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=306.04s)]
*  and ask and answer questions to the students. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=311.12s)]
*  What kindergartner has a question about cross-dressing? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=314.04s)]
*  And do you trust a purple-haired woman with a nose ring and a trans flag on her desk to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=318.2s)]
*  have an honest conversation with your kid? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=323.2s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=325.84s)]
*  What's scary here, Dana, is they're so adamant about this that they've gone all the way to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=327.84s)]
*  the highest court in the land and they've spent a million dollars in legal fees. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=333.64s)]
*  And their argument is this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=339.64s)]
*  If one or two people opt out, then the lesson doesn't work. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=341.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  So that's like saying if two guys get a doctor's note to get them out of gym class and there's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  kids still in gym, then gym doesn't work. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=354.32s)]
*  That's a preposterous argument. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=358.52s)]
*  And Alito, I cannot wait to read his book. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=360.12s)]
*  Greg, you've got a great amount of notes. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=363.68s)]
*  That I do, sweetheart. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=367.84s)]
*  If you know, you know. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=372.48s)]
*  Got to watch it three. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=373.48s)]
*  You know, we have to, this is the most important point of this segment. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=375.48s)]
*  This is not about gays or lesbians. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=381.16s)]
*  It's about activists. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=383.6s)]
*  No reasonable gay wants to be part of this story. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=385.72s)]
*  No gay wants to talk to your kids. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=389.24s)]
*  This is the phenomenon of the activist and it's ruined the gay brand. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=392.0s)]
*  Once they added T to L and G and B, it was over. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=397.92s)]
*  Gays, what did you think about your gay best friend? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=402.6s)]
*  Fun, creative, artistic, the best person to go out drinking with because they're hilarious. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=406.44000000000005s)]
*  Or shopping. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=412.08s)]
*  And then the T got attached. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=413.52s)]
*  And with that came all this activism. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=416.12s)]
*  And it sucked all the fun out of it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=419.44s)]
*  And suddenly it started becoming this evasive, this invasive thing in people's lives. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=421.12s)]
*  And gays and lesbians are like, hell no. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  We don't want any part of this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=429.92s)]
*  This is not us. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=431.2s)]
*  This is where, again, identity politics has blinded its followers to the basic concerns [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=433.0s)]
*  of most, if not all Americans, including gays and lesbians. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=438.32s)]
*  Nobody cares what you do in your house. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=442.44s)]
*  Don't compel it on my family. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=444.04s)]
*  We will fight you every step of the way. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  The percentage of children who identify as non-binary has more than like quadrupled in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=448.04s)]
*  the past, what, five years. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  That's evidence of a psychological contagion that has been spread by social media, hijacked [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=454.64s)]
*  by men who cosplay and women who are mentally ill. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=461.32s)]
*  If this were a phase among kids, it would be great. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=466.3s)]
*  But now you have activists who are exploiting that phase to somehow justify their miserable [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=468.76s)]
*  life choices. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=474.08s)]
*  Just saw an article in Politico on Governor Pritzker. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=475.5s)]
*  It was a glowing effort to paint him as a front runner. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=479.3s)]
*  Right up front, he says, we're bullying basically a tiny minority, a small defenseless, he was [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=482.65999999999997s)]
*  talking about trans kids. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=489.02s)]
*  He was basically painting parents as bullies because they were concerned about their children. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=490.86s)]
*  Then he said, trans kids have a higher rate of suicide. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=496.5s)]
*  Not true. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=500.1s)]
*  In fact, that is an egregious lie that is used by activists to separate their parents [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=501.1s)]
*  from their children. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=506.02s)]
*  When their parents say, I'm concerned about my child being fed some kind of brainwash, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=507.1s)]
*  they say, you're going to have blood on your hands. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  How many trans kids do you want to kill? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=514.8s)]
*  This is not gays. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=517.3s)]
*  This is not lesbians. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=518.3s)]
*  I would say it's probably not even the majority of trans. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=519.3s)]
*  This is trans activism. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=521.5s)]
*  So I think this concept of trans kids, well, I know it is a false construction. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=523.42s)]
*  It's a confabulation that went unchecked out of fear of being called transphobic and financial [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=529.42s)]
*  gain by unscrupulous doctors who should be in jail. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=535.62s)]
*  So I'll end on this. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=539.02s)]
*  A child could be mentally ill and think that their healthy arm needs to be amputated. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=540.9799999999999s)]
*  It's called xenomelia. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=546.8199999999999s)]
*  It's when you feel that your limb is not part of your body. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=548.06s)]
*  Would a doctor remove that limb? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=552.54s)]
*  No, he would be jailed. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=555.98s)]
*  Why are genitals different than your arm or your leg? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=558.5s)]
*  That's a question they cannot answer. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=562.02s)]
*  Sandra, I'll turn it over to you to say whatever you want, but I just want to point out for [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=564.14s)]
*  everybody on the board something that Martha McCallum was talking about with the teachers [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  union representative at three o'clock. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=571.42s)]
*  Maryland school rankings for math and reading. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=574.54s)]
*  If you look at 2013, they were second and 16th in the country. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=577.78s)]
*  And just in 11 years, now they're 20th and 39th. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=582.8199999999999s)]
*  This is not a focus for the teachers unions. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=588.74s)]
*  And they should be focusing on reading, writing, and arithmetic. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=591.06s)]
*  But Randy Weingarten told Martha that they want to focus on the whole child. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  She said 90% of it's reading, writing, arithmetic and their studies, 10% on the whole child. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=598.3399999999999s)]
*  That's too much with report cards like that. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=603.6999999999999s)]
*  JB Pritzker has to answer for that in Illinois as well. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=605.86s)]
*  Look, Billy Mojas is one of the plaintiffs in this case, and she was on America reports [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=609.3000000000001s)]
*  at one o'clock today. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=613.58s)]
*  She's not even going as far to say get this out of the schools altogether. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=615.58s)]
*  We want the option as parents to opt out. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=619.7s)]
*  It was there before. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=624.22s)]
*  They took it away from us. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=625.3000000000001s)]
*  We want to reinstate that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=626.7s)]
*  We want to have the choice. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=628.1s)]
*  And I think I said this to you at the commercial break. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=629.4200000000001s)]
*  We spend, I mean, I'm not tying blood, sweat, and tears on social, religious, moral values [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=632.5s)]
*  in the walls of our home. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=640.78s)]
*  And what the teachers union is saying is that when we hand off our kids and the door shuts [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=642.66s)]
*  to the public school, that we are to not only not care, but not have any say in what they're [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=647.14s)]
*  putting in front of those children. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=652.62s)]
*  And that is at the core of the Supreme Court argument. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=654.3399999999999s)]
*  And this does look like it is moving in favor of those parents. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=656.78s)]
*  It is, and then it will have effect all across the country as it is in SCOTUS. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvOmoJl6nU&t=659.34s)]
