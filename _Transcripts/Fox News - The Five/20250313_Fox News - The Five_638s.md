# 'The Five': Dems become 'party of the tantrum' as the left starts a 'manufactured movement'
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8)
*  Free Mahmoud! Free them all! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=0.0s)]
*  Number one! [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=2.84s)]
*  Free the town! [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=3.96s)]
*  Free Mahmoud! Free them all! [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=5.14s)]
*  The left is letting out their radical rage by torching Teslas and taking over Trump Tower. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=7.44s)]
*  The NYPD arresting nearly 100 anti-Israel protesters who stormed the lobby of the President's home in New York City just a few blocks from here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=13.24s)]
*  Demanding the release of ex-Columbian student and Ivy League protest ringleader Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=21.54s)]
*  And that's not the only target. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=26.44s)]
*  Violent attacks on Tesla dealerships are ramping up as it becomes a proxy for anger at Elon Musk and Doge. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  President Trump vowing to label the violence as domestic terrorism. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  But instead of just calling out the anarchy, some folks want to condemn how Trump is cracking down on them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=38.64s)]
*  You're either with the Tesla or you're with the terrorists. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=45.56s)]
*  Trump thinks that if you try to kill cops to overthrow the government and change an election, that's not domestic terrorism. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=48.24s)]
*  But somehow having a protest in front of a Tesla dealership is. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Just to be clear, you protest a private company. You are labeled by this administration a domestic terrorist. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=57.48s)]
*  But they loved him before they hated him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=64.16s)]
*  Many are pointing out how Musk was once a darling of the media. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=66.12s)]
*  Musk, aka real life Iron Man. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk is doing things that may revolutionize transportation and climate change. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=73.0s)]
*  Staggeringly rich and staggeringly intelligent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  A wonderful out of this world, incredible images from the first all civilian orbit around Earth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=80.92s)]
*  A huge win for Elon Musk. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=85.72s)]
*  As a leader in science and technology, whose name may indeed belong alongside those of Edison and Jobs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=87.28s)]
*  Judge, earlier today, Caroline Levitt said that the only reason Democrats changed their minds on Tesla is because Elon Musk changed his mind on Donald Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=96.04s)]
*  And I think Musk has said similar. He's like, well, they used to love me. Not anymore. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=103.6s)]
*  Well, the truth is that the left is so full of hate and they still haven't figured out why they lost the election. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=107.92s)]
*  And their hypocrisy knows no bounds. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=115.56s)]
*  Just like we heard, if they if they love Elon Musk because he's a wonderful person, they will hate him not because of anything that he's done, but because of who he's aligned himself with. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=118.92s)]
*  And this is classic left over there going into Trump Tower, which certainly is a public area. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=130.24s)]
*  But they are there trespassing at some point when they're told to leave. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=137.4s)]
*  They're there obstructing the police and the police's effort to get them out of there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=142.72s)]
*  And they're there resisting arrest because they're there because they believe in Mahmoud Khalil and they want Mahmoud to have all of his constitutional rights. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=146.96s)]
*  A guy who's been in the country for two years, who believes in the takedown of Western civilization and who hates Israel and pretty much hates all of our Western values. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=156.12s)]
*  Everything they're doing is backwards. It's not making sense. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=167.04s)]
*  It's not normal. And for them to die on this hill, as opposed to any of the other hills that we would understand, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  Lake and Riley, men and women's sports, little DJ, they figure that Mahmoud Khalil, the guy they're all promoting, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=178.0s)]
*  who's been here for two years from Syria, who pretty much is cooperating and working with a foreign terrorist organization, is the way to get back into America's heart. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=186.16s)]
*  But can you do a quick thing for everybody about the labeling of the attacks at Tesla plants as domestic terrorism? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  Does that label fit? Well, you know what the label does fit? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=203.04s)]
*  But I think the president said, I think it could be domestic terrorism. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  He didn't say it would certainly be. I imagine that it depends. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the violence that we're hearing about is, you know, Molotov cocktails, arsons. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, and it's coordinated. There's a conspiracy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, depends on the facts. Got you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  Jessica, can you imagine 10 years ago if someone had said that Republicans would be showcasing electric cars on the White House lawn and the president be like, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to buy one. John Hannity is going to buy one. And that the Democrats would be firebombing electric vehicle dealerships. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=230.28s)]
*  It has been a crazy decade on on many levels. I wouldn't have guessed that Donald Trump would be our president. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=237.64s)]
*  Round one, let alone round two. So times they are changing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=242.48s)]
*  Putting aside the Molotov cocktails and graffiti and all that, and if they're breaking laws, then they should be pursued to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=247.16s)]
*  But not buying Teslas or selling your Tesla, that's putting the free market to work. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=255.24s)]
*  That's what people do when they're not happy with a brand anymore. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=260.0s)]
*  You know, Dylan Mulvaney after the Budweiser can Kid Rock out there shooting those cans, people smashing Keurig's. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=262.72s)]
*  You know, this is Peter hasn't bought Gillette in like 10 years. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=271.36s)]
*  Right. So that's how the market is supposed to work. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=274.8s)]
*  And people are sending a message to Elon Musk that, yes, maybe five, six years ago, they thought, you know, he's going up there with Edison. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=277.88s)]
*  But right now they don't like what Doge is doing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  They think he has too much power within the government. And they're speaking with their checkbooks. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=286.92s)]
*  And that feels perfectly reasonable and how the free market should work. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=291.16s)]
*  Jesse, I was watching the protesters today at Trump Tower and I never get over this feeling of like, I've never in my life had time to do that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=295.52s)]
*  Never. I've worked since high school. I would have to achieve. I want I have hobbies. I have a life. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=304.8s)]
*  I don't I can't even conceive of going and doing something like that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm starting to realize these people might not have jobs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=316.24s)]
*  And I'm starting to realize they might be getting paid to protest. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  And and Will Kane showed Open Society Soros is funding it. And that's fun. I love it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=323.0s)]
*  The more you guys make fools of yourselves, the better it is for moi. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=329.24s)]
*  A couple of years ago, Musk was saving the planet. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=333.72s)]
*  He was going to other planets and he was in love with the Democrats. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=336.52s)]
*  They were both in love. And then they had this horrible breakup. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  But Musk says he didn't change. They changed. He was always about free enterprise and free speech. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=342.36s)]
*  They went full wacko. They tried to transition one of his kids. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=347.48s)]
*  And then he buys Twitter and realized that they were censoring everybody. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=352.0s)]
*  And then he sees Trump get shot. It kind of gives him a political awakening. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=356.16s)]
*  And he goes all in and Trump gets elected. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=360.88000000000005s)]
*  He comes and he wants to make the government more efficient at great expense to himself and his company [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=363.36s)]
*  and finds out the Democrats are stealing from the government. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=368.56s)]
*  So he caught him censoring you and then he caught him stealing from you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=371.04s)]
*  And he's humiliated them. This is not your average breakup. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=375.12s)]
*  This is like you hit him where it hurts. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  And now the Democrats don't have the emotional intelligence to kind of reconcile this breakup. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=380.32000000000005s)]
*  So they just oppose everything in a blind rage. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=386.44000000000005s)]
*  It makes no sense. Donald Trump and Elon Musk have made them support shutdowns. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=390.56s)]
*  They're against peace. They're against green cars. They're against women. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=396.96s)]
*  It's weird. And we're watching it unfold. Now they're supporting an anti-Semite. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=401.88s)]
*  This is a guy. He's not even American. He comes here. He hates Jews. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=406.64s)]
*  He blows up Colombia, cost them 400 million bucks. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=410.36s)]
*  And they're out there like this guy's Gandhi. And so have at it left. Keep going. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=413.52s)]
*  It kind of reminded me of all the protests you would see at like the World Trade Organization. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=420.04s)]
*  And remember like all the sort of anarchists, anti-capitalism. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=423.92s)]
*  There might be some stuff behind that, though. But at first, we've got to stop referring to this guy as a student. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he's a man. He's 31. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=434.24s)]
*  I mean, if Charles Manson took a night course, would we refer to him as a student? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=437.2s)]
*  No, he was a murderer. This guy is an agent, let's be honest. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=442.6s)]
*  You know, remember, you can look at what USAID did in other countries, you know, fomenting color revolutions. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=448.6s)]
*  What's he doing here? Issues. It's not about Doge. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=454.36s)]
*  None of these people are upset about Doge. They don't even pay attention. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=457.68s)]
*  Like you said, these are people who aren't really part of an everyday normal society. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=460.56s)]
*  You know what I always do when I when I check out these protests? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=465.64s)]
*  I look for one thing, attractive people. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=468.48s)]
*  None there. Mostly young, female and homely. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=473.08s)]
*  There are a few guys in there, you know, speckled into the stereotypical goateed cream puff. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=476.56s)]
*  But they might have been women, too. And they're talking about Nazis. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=481.96s)]
*  Well, who are the Nazis by their definition? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=484.96s)]
*  Because once they claim you're a Nazi, they will do whatever they want to you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=487.08s)]
*  That's what they said. They were that they were at the protest were Jews. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=489.44s)]
*  But will the media check that? I doubt it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  And they will not check the media will also not check who paid for those signs, who paid for those T-shirts. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=494.96s)]
*  And as you said, who paid for the protesters? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  This protest, all these protesters are as organic as a Twinkie. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=504.16s)]
*  This is not real. This is a manufactured activity to create the delusion of a movement. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=508.64s)]
*  I don't think Democrats should be heartened by this to be seen as the party of the tantrum. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=516.36s)]
*  You know, all this explosion of negative energy is compared to the other side, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=521.2s)]
*  which is this consistent optimism and positivity. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=526.48s)]
*  Things are happening. We just had a temporary truce between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=531.12s)]
*  We've watched illegal immigration slow to a trickle. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=535.4000000000001s)]
*  The government is getting a much needed audit on behalf of the taxpayers, not on behalf of the politicians. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=539.24s)]
*  And it's driven by the most energetic, optimistic leader you've probably seen in a generation even more. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=544.84s)]
*  And what do you got? Mercenaries of misery who just go out there and disrupt because they have all this fricking free time. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  Makes you wonder that, you know, it's funny, why are leftists so politically chaotic, intimidating and unhinged? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  You can mention January 6th, but the exception proves the rule. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=563.8s)]
*  That was one moment. You know, the left has had 50 plus years of political unrest. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=567.28s)]
*  And I just, it goes back and I think it answers your question. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=573.56s)]
*  There's an aimlessness when you become a leftist. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=576.4s)]
*  And the aimlessness is aided and abetted by a political narcissism where you're told yourself matters, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=579.4799999999999s)]
*  which is why they elevate trans activism and Hamas terrorists. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=585.92s)]
*  Then you get to the whole Musk thing. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=589.9599999999999s)]
*  The contradiction and the inconsistencies in their support for him are based primarily on the fact of aimlessness. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=591.92s)]
*  They wake up every morning without a plan. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=598.36s)]
*  They could love you one minute and hate you the next because underneath it all, they have no real purpose in life. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=600.4s)]
*  And it's miserable. So the lifestyle of the activists you see is unkempt, broke, emotional, just unhappy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=605.8s)]
*  I'm going to stop there. I was going to, I was going to quote the Bible, but I think I'll save that for the next segment. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=614.48s)]
*  Is it next block? Save the Bible? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=618.52s)]
*  They're like the prodigal son, yet they haven't come home. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=620.04s)]
*  There you go. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=624.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sZT3qfvs8&t=625.12s)]
