# ‘The Five’ highlights team Biden 'in awe' of deal-making Don
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw)
*  It is pretty remarkable that you have Biden administration officials saying publicly, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=0.0s)]
*  wow, we wish we could have done something like that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=4.0s)]
*  It's pretty great. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=6.48s)]
*  I love it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=7.48s)]
*  And Biden didn't see what was possible. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=8.48s)]
*  One, because he didn't understand the power of oil. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=10.32s)]
*  He was a green guy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=13.24s)]
*  And two, he didn't understand how to play these people off of each other. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=14.24s)]
*  Trump, we're very close with Israel, but we've sidelined the Israelis throughout this [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=17.48s)]
*  whole trip. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=22.12s)]
*  We're directly negotiating with Iran, the Houthis, and Hamas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=23.12s)]
*  And we're basically waiting for Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza because that unlocks [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=27.16s)]
*  the Abraham Accords. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=31.44s)]
*  And now that we got our last American hostage out of there, the pressure's on them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=32.72s)]
*  Now, the Iranians are selling drones to the Russians. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=37.56s)]
*  How do we stop that? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=41.0s)]
*  You get the Saudis to drive the price of oil down so Putin has to negotiate, end the war, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=42.28s)]
*  and they cut off the drone sales. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=47.18s)]
*  Also, we've isolated the Iranians because their best friend, Assad, is gone. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=49.16s)]
*  He's lounging in Moscow. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=54.36s)]
*  And so we also caught the Chinese buying sanctioned oil from the Iranians, and Trump's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=56.2s)]
*  threatening to slap whoppers of more sanctions on that oil. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=62.24s)]
*  And if that happens, they have to negotiate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=66.48s)]
*  The Iranians are in the weakest position ever. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=69.64s)]
*  That's why they're going to do this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=72.92s)]
*  So if you control the Middle East oil supply, if we ever go to war with China, oh, too bad. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=74.04s)]
*  The Chinese import 100 percent of their oil. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=80.2s)]
*  So with our Navy and our control over the Middle East, we can bring them to their knees [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=83.74s)]
*  without even squeezing a trigger. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=88.78s)]
*  Sebastian Gorka said something very brilliant today. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  Why are you laughing, Greg? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  Your impression? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=97.82s)]
*  That's actually how you pronounce his name. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=98.82s)]
*  Gorka. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=101.14s)]
*  Gorka. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=102.14s)]
*  He said eight years ago, the strategy in the Middle East was security, destroy ISIS and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=103.14s)]
*  Abraham Accords. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=108.3s)]
*  And now it's prosperity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=109.84s)]
*  It's kind of like what we did after World War II, Japan and Western Europe. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=112.96s)]
*  We had this economic alliance that just created so much wealth over the last few decades. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  What has happened in the Middle East? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=123.36s)]
*  They've been at war since the 80s. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=124.36s)]
*  We're doing the same thing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=126.16s)]
*  They have liquid gold and they're sitting right in the middle of the crossroads between [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  Asia and Europe. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=131.98s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to disagree with you on the part about the Israelis, because I don't think [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=135.16s)]
*  the purpose is to distance. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  In fact, when they killed Sinwar yesterday, the Americans said nothing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=140.36s)]
*  When Obama's team went over there, every time they went, they had to say something critical [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=144.36s)]
*  about the Israelis. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=148.36s)]
*  And the Trump administration has not done that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=149.44000000000003s)]
*  Harold, do you want to politely disagree with me again? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=155.36s)]
*  I think, look, whenever an American president succeeds, it's good to be back around the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=156.36s)]
*  table, whenever an American president succeeds, I applaud them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think it's very hard not to see some of the things that Jesse just outlined that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  the president and his team have been able to accomplish on this amazing trip. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  The president did a little of everything he normally does. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=173.94s)]
*  There's a great showmanship and a great theater. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=176.6s)]
*  There's great substance. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=179.06s)]
*  You have a trillion dollars, it sounds like, if not more, of investment opportunities and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=180.06s)]
*  commitments to invest in the United States from our allies there in the region. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  It's still not totally clear to me what we get for the lifting the sanctions on Syria, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=189.34s)]
*  but I like the progress. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=193.84s)]
*  I think you have to be willing to make peace with your enemies because you don't need to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=194.92s)]
*  make peace with your friends. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=198.32s)]
*  So finding ways in which to advance us commercially is a really, really smart thing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=199.44s)]
*  As he gets home, I'll be interested to hear the Israel part again. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  I disagree with you, Jesse, on that part. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=209.0s)]
*  I agree with Dana. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=210.48s)]
*  I'm not saying we're not allies. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=211.48s)]
*  I'm just saying we're doing a lot of stuff on the side without them bringing them to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=212.48s)]
*  the table. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  No, you said that we are distancing from them on purpose and making deals with other people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  We're directly negotiating with Amos. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Never happened before. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  Pull the tape. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=223.24s)]
*  We always have the Israelis in our bag during these negotiations. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=224.24s)]
*  We just did a one-on-one with the Houthis. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=228.24s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=231.24s)]
*  So I think all of it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=232.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=233.24s)]
*  I'll just take back what little time I have left. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=234.24s)]
*  I think all of this is a positive, and I think I'm looking forward to the next, I think, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=235.24s)]
*  which is equally important because we've had such chaos and turmoil in that region of the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=240.24s)]
*  world for a long time. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=244.44s)]
*  I'm looking forward to how the president approaches the Ukraine-Russia negotiation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=245.44s)]
*  I hope that we see that in the next two weeks. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=249.44s)]
*  I hope that we still are able to get the rare earth minerals deal from them because I think [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=252.8s)]
*  that's so important to us being able to counter China going forward. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=256.8s)]
*  And if this trip is any indication of what the president's able to accomplish, I'm optimistic [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=259.8s)]
*  about what he'll be able to get done. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=264.8s)]
*  Kellyanne, it's interesting to have the juxtaposition yet again. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=265.8s)]
*  This has been going on for almost a year with President Trump getting wins and the Biden [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=268.8s)]
*  team continuing to suffer losses. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=274.28s)]
*  That also continued this week as you compare one administration to the next. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=276.28s)]
*  And I think that's in the middle of all of these books coming out saying that Biden [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  wasn't really even in charge. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, he clearly was not in charge. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  And look, this is central to the Trump candidacy and presidency to just do this global transformative [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  power of peace through strength, but peace through wealth now. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  And I think that those twin pillars really define his two interrupted terms. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  This week was bookended, though. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=302.76000000000005s)]
*  Everything that we see that happened during the work week, Dana, it was bookended by Greer [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  in Geneva, sitting down with the Chinese and also Edon Alexander being returned in our [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=309.92s)]
*  backyard here to Teneflay, New Jersey. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=315.92s)]
*  And I think on the back end of this, you're going to see so much more American investment [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=318.48s)]
*  in America, foreign investment in America. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=322.82s)]
*  How many American CEOs were there this week? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=325.44s)]
*  They didn't need to go. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=328.28s)]
*  They can just go to the Oval Office. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=329.28s)]
*  They can put out a press release about my new factory, my new facility, my new manufacturing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=330.42s)]
*  on shoring. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  They wanted to be there because they knew that this was historic. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=336.26s)]
*  Not just for the billions and the trillions, but it's historic for the peace stuff, too. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=340.6s)]
*  I just want to review quickly. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=344.6s)]
*  In Trump 1, what he did to Iran is so transformative. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=346.24s)]
*  Obama gets the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=351.6s)]
*  It's announced in October 2009. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=353.32s)]
*  He's not even on the job for eight months, nine months. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=355.16s)]
*  He's going to get the Peace Prize. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=358.24s)]
*  He gives us the Muslim Brotherhood. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=359.24s)]
*  He screws up Syria, Libya, Egypt, you name it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=360.52s)]
*  Here comes Trump in the first term and he says, Iran, we're going to cut off your basic, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=364.34s)]
*  your livelihood, your oil, your energy production. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=370.5s)]
*  And he enforced sanctions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=373.38s)]
*  What did that do? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=374.5s)]
*  Iran was flat on its back looking to do a deal. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=375.5s)]
*  Biden gets in there. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=377.9s)]
*  He and John Kerry put us back in the JCPOA. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=379.26s)]
*  They take off of the foreign terrorist organizations, the Houthis and Hamas, and look at everything [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=382.46s)]
*  that's happened since. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=387.46s)]
*  So this is called causation, not coincidence. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=388.85999999999996s)]
*  And the fact that the Democrats just can't shake themselves loose of Biden a year after [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=392.1s)]
*  they shook themselves loose of Biden tells you everything about that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=396.14000000000004s)]
*  If just a Democrat or three, Harold, will come forward and say, you know what, I'm going [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=399.72s)]
*  to vote for that tax cut and Jobs Act bill. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=403.38s)]
*  I think this was great this week. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=405.66s)]
*  I'm going to be part of the DREG, I'm going to be part of the energy dominance. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=407.5s)]
*  To Jesse's point, if oil goes down... [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=410.6s)]
*  If you get all the Republicans, I'll get three Democrats if you get every Republican. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=412.3s)]
*  Okay, I'm working on it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=414.82000000000005s)]
*  But if oil goes down even more, this guy is completely unstoppable. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=416.38s)]
*  This was the most successful week of the Trump presidency so far. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=420.9s)]
*  All right, Greg Gutfeld, without sneezing, can you give us a brilliant, brilliant point? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=423.94s)]
*  I have hay fever. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=429.46s)]
*  All right, is that hay fever? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=430.46s)]
*  I think it's really bad allergies this year. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=431.46s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=433.85999999999996s)]
*  Why does the world respond to Trump in a way that confuses Western media? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=434.85999999999996s)]
*  It's because the world wants what he has and the media doesn't. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  They understand aspirational goals, like you said. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=441.94s)]
*  To them, Trump is a possibility machine. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=444.88s)]
*  If you're going to meet him, you better meet him because you never know what you might [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=448.18s)]
*  get out of him. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=451.12s)]
*  But there was no sense of hope with the Democrats, not when your hood ornament was a decomposing [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=452.6s)]
*  bureaucrat. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=456.86s)]
*  What were you going to get out of that? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=458.46s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember when the media was telling us Trump was a global laughing [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=459.54s)]
*  stock. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=464.7s)]
*  Might have been a few weeks ago, I think. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=465.7s)]
*  Now they're giving him jets. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=467.54s)]
*  Before they were giving Joe Biden transfusions. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=469.14s)]
*  Doesn't seem that people are treating him like a laughing stock. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=471.9s)]
*  They're legitimately excited. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=474.78000000000003s)]
*  They are alive around Trump. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=476.56s)]
*  So it's another one of the media lies. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=478.72s)]
*  We're sick of talking about the media's lies, but you got to ask, is the media sick of their [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=480.5s)]
*  constant losing their framework, their framing, which they use to perceive reality keeps leading [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=485.2s)]
*  them to defeat. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=492.9s)]
*  Every day they think something's going to happen and it doesn't happen. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=494.36s)]
*  TDS is a lousy filter to perceive life. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=498.4s)]
*  The election, trade, immigration, the Maryland man, you know, every single issue, the Dems [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=502.4s)]
*  are ritually humiliated and it's because of their filter. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  For Trump doing big things is easy because we aren't stuck reinventing basic principles. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=513.78s)]
*  You know, he says, let's work on a peace deal. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=518.52s)]
*  Let's get rich. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=520.68s)]
*  It's not let's push trans awareness in Malaysia. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=521.68s)]
*  You want a laughing stock? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=525.24s)]
*  You know, the world's greatest country was going around the world questioning biology. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=526.6s)]
*  These countries don't have the luxury or the time for that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=531.92s)]
*  They want peace and prosperity, not drag queen story hour. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=534.68s)]
*  We were the laughing stock under Biden and now it's all back to normal. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=538.28s)]
*  They understand winning. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=542.14s)]
*  So my advice to Dems is if you see somebody winning a lot, you got to ask yourself, what [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=544.04s)]
*  does that person have that you don't have? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=548.8s)]
*  That's how you learn. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  You run into people your entire life and you wonder, man, they got it figured out. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=552.56s)]
*  It's one thing you look at Trump. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=556.88s)]
*  He's got it figured out. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=558.24s)]
*  They see it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=559.5999999999999s)]
*  We see it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=560.5999999999999s)]
*  Those are the people that should guide you. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=561.6s)]
*  The problem with the Dems is their delusional assessment of Trump can't explain his success [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=563.6s)]
*  and they also can't predict it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=570.24s)]
*  So they pin their hopes every morning waking up that he's going to fail and every morning [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=572.44s)]
*  they're disappointed and they get more miserable and they get more desperate. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=577.4s)]
*  I don't see any hope for them. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  Like they used to hope that the judicial system was going to solve their problems. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=584.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygNq_aXkKw&t=587.36s)]
