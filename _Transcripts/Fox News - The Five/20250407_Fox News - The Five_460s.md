# Gutfeld: If this was a coverup, it was the worst ever
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44)
*  They were all in on it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=0.0s)]
*  A slew of bombshell Biden books reveal how Democrats privately knew Joe Biden was in [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=2.0s)]
*  mental decline, but covered it up anyway. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=7.0s)]
*  Some lawmakers are scrambling to cover their tracks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Senator Adam Schiff insisted that it was hard to gauge the president's mental capacity in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=13.72s)]
*  the lead up to his catastrophic debate. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=19.0s)]
*  Do you think that former President Biden's advisors misled the American people about [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=22.2s)]
*  his capacities? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=28.26s)]
*  You know, it's hard for me to gauge what their the closest advisors to the president were [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=29.26s)]
*  seeing at the time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=34.78s)]
*  I can only speak to the interactions that I had with him, which were, you know, in the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=36.06s)]
*  months leading up to his getting out of the race, largely ceremonial occasions. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=41.22s)]
*  But if you'll remember, Shifty Schiff blasted special counsel Robert Herr over a concerning [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=46.14s)]
*  report on Biden's memory. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=51.22s)]
*  OK, Jesse. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=53.82000000000001s)]
*  So Welker is saying, besides being late in the game to even ask the question, she's asking [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=55.2s)]
*  if the president's advisors misled the American people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  But isn't this way of this her way of shifting the blame from the media and herself? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=67.04s)]
*  The media has culpability, but no one more than the advisors, because they were on the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=73.28s)]
*  inside and they saw everything and participated in the cover up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  That's why one of the reasons they're going to bring in the doctor, O'Connor, who evaluated [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=82.1s)]
*  Biden for this whole time. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=88.08s)]
*  Did he ever give him a Parkinson's evaluation? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Did he give him an Alzheimer's evaluation? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=92.58s)]
*  Why, Judge? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=94.58s)]
*  After a couple days after the coup, this guy said Joe Biden was mentally fit. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=95.86s)]
*  He obviously wasn't mentally fit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=102.02s)]
*  Did he ever give him a cognitive test? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  So he's going to have to come in under oath, swear to tell the truth and tell the entire [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=105.61999999999999s)]
*  world what he knew and when he knew it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  So they're also going to have to bring in the chief of staff as well, because he was [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  obviously the president. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=116.42s)]
*  Now, Dr. Jill, I'm reading this book, Fight. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=117.74s)]
*  This is a good one. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Jill was obsessed with the trappings of the White House. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  Love the chef, love the plane, couldn't leave. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  People were like, I don't know if he should run again. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=128.42s)]
*  Dr. Jill was adamant that they remain there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=130.38s)]
*  And you're hearing other little nuggets, too. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=133.9s)]
*  This guy, Joe, would just sit in the Beast for 15 minutes after the car pulled up to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=135.54s)]
*  his destination and just sit there alone in the car doing nothing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=141.17999999999998s)]
*  And then you get out of the car. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=147.82s)]
*  Just wasting his time just sitting. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=149.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, Harold, the whole thing with her report, Joe Biden comes out and the White [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=152.94s)]
*  House comes out and they question her assessment that Biden's got, you know, a nice guy with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  poor memory. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=165.1s)]
*  And they allowed Joe Biden to go out there and say, how the hell dare her raise my son's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=166.1s)]
*  death? And then he lies about what he said that was in a transcript. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=173.54s)]
*  Those advisors knew that Biden was out there lying. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  They did nothing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=181.62s)]
*  I don't know. We could find out that all of these things happen to be true. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  But here's the truth of it. We know that he went into a debate, had an awful, awful [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=186.9s)]
*  experience in the debate. The Democratic Party did the right thing and said, you should [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=191.42s)]
*  not be our nominee. I think they probably regret that they didn't perhaps open it up [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=195.38s)]
*  to a primary. But your points about whether or not they should have done more, they'll [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  have to answer that question. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=203.06s)]
*  I do know if someone wants to pull up from the house and sit for a while, I'm reminded [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=204.94s)]
*  of that great scene, Colonel Jessup and a few good men when they asked, why that young [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=207.66s)]
*  man who wanted to go home so much, why didn't he pack his bag the night before? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=211.7s)]
*  He said, look, maybe he's an early riser. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  Maybe he just likes to sit in the car when he pulls up to places. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=215.94s)]
*  Who knows? All I do know is all I do know is this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=218.1s)]
*  What happened? He ended up not being the nominee. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=221.14s)]
*  And the question becomes, should he have stepped down earlier? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=223.94s)]
*  He will have to live with that as well as long as as well as his advisors. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=227.38s)]
*  You know, Dana, I don't know if that's the question that not only he but his advisors [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=231.5s)]
*  and doctors and the media, we all saw it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=235.98s)]
*  Waltz now is coming out with the classic lessons learned. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  Kind of. I mean, he kind of is. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=243.34s)]
*  I don't think I don't see any Democrat taking full responsibility yet. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=245.78s)]
*  And until they do, they will not be able to shake this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=249.1s)]
*  I think they have done generational harm to the Democratic Party. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=251.7s)]
*  And I know that they're they're they don't want to be mean. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=254.66s)]
*  But there are I think that you're right about the former first lady [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=257.74s)]
*  wanting to stay and be she is the person who was closest to Joe Biden, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  who could have said, you have done amazing work for 40 years as a public servant. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=267.82s)]
*  And it is time for us to go spend some more time with our grandchildren. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=273.58s)]
*  And it's going to be a great second part of our lives. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=276.5s)]
*  Let's go. Let's just let's. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=279.9s)]
*  And even if they didn't want to endorse Kamala Harris at the time, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=281.5s)]
*  then at least they would have given them time to try to do something. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=284.7s)]
*  But now when all the Democrats say, well, what about Trump? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=287.14s)]
*  It brings hollow because we're not done asking questions or reading these books. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=290.26s)]
*  And the other thing is about the media who are now writing these books. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=294.02s)]
*  Where were they to defend people like Annie Linsky of The Wall Street Journal [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=297.26s)]
*  or Alex Thompson of Axios when they were writing it? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=300.97999999999996s)]
*  And you had elected officials and Hollywood and White House staffers [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  who all came out trying to destroy their careers, saying that they were lying [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=308.66s)]
*  when they were absolutely right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=312.3s)]
*  And now they want to write books and make money off of that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, Greg, it's like Jake Tapper fighting with Laura Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  You don't have a degree to assess cognitive decline. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=322.5s)]
*  The worst thing is that they assume we don't remember these things. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=325.18s)]
*  This, you know, I disagree with Jesse and quite strongly. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=328.22s)]
*  I don't care about the advisors. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=332.82s)]
*  I don't at all, because if this was a cover up, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=335.06s)]
*  it was the worst cover up in history because all of us saw it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=338.74s)]
*  So it wasn't a cover up. It was a denial. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  It was a denial. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  They were they were telling us that what we were seeing wasn't true. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=348.38s)]
*  The advisors weren't doing that. That was the media. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=352.82s)]
*  So as long as we follow this dictated narrative, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=355.58s)]
*  what did the Dems know and when did they know it? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=358.9s)]
*  We're letting the real culprits off the hook. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=361.06s)]
*  MSNBC, CNN, others, they actively denied this and shamed people who had the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=362.82s)]
*  who were just common sense and saying, look, you know, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  there could be so many villains that it's impossible to round them all up. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=371.22s)]
*  But I do want them to answer for it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=375.38s)]
*  I want the chickens to come home to a roost. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=377.7s)]
*  But I have a feeling that since it's the industry itself that's at fault, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=379.82s)]
*  they're not going to investigate themselves. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=383.82s)]
*  They never do. But I'll tell you what, they killed themselves. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=385.38s)]
*  The media committed suicide on this one. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=388.54s)]
*  You know, something as banal as the weather, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=390.42s)]
*  I don't trust them giving me today's weather. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkkY_Td4Y44&t=393.02000000000004s)]
