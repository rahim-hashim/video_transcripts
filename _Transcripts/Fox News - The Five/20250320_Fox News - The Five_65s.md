# Gutfeld: We live in the broken windows theory every day #gutfeld #foxnews #thefive #news #trump
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY)
*  The broken windows theory, okay? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=0.0s)]
*  This was never debunked, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=2.24s)]
*  but they allowed that narrative to take place [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=4.24s)]
*  based on one faulty study, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=6.88s)]
*  when the reality is we live [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=8.72s)]
*  in the broken windows theory every day. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=10.88s)]
*  The reason why I don't come to the five [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=13.88s)]
*  in sandals and a Speedo, even if I wanted to, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=15.68s)]
*  it lowers standards, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=19.22s)]
*  and lowering standards lowers standards more. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=21.0s)]
*  Also, the women wouldn't handle my sexy feet. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=23.76s)]
*  But we establish criteria at work and at home, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=26.82s)]
*  base level behavior, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=31.7s)]
*  we don't leave dirty dishes on our bed, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=33.46s)]
*  we leave the toilet seat down, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=36.64s)]
*  the dirty laundry's in the hamper and not on the floor, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=38.18s)]
*  and suddenly we think that that does not apply [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=41.0s)]
*  to the street? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=44.74s)]
*  Of course it does. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=46.72s)]
*  We need to bring back the broken windows policing, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=48.54s)]
*  and the sooner the better, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=54.14s)]
*  and we need to debunk these ideas, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=55.86s)]
*  whoever came up with them, that it doesn't work. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=58.02s)]
*  You don't even need research. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_bn_ZQ6YY&t=60.18s)]
