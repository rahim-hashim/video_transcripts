# 'The Five' panel gets heated over Trump's Soleimani airstrike
**Fox News - The Five:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8)
*  He was plotting attacks against Americans, but now we've ensured that his atrocities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=0.0s)]
*  have been stopped for good. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  They are stopped for good. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=9.52s)]
*  I don't know if you know what was happening, but he was planning a very major attack and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=11.56s)]
*  we got him. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=17.48s)]
*  That was President Trump moments ago explaining why he took action to kill Iran's top general. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=18.8s)]
*  He says he did it to prevent a war, but his critics are piling on. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=23.8s)]
*  We appear to be, without congressional authorization, entering into another Middle East war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=28.48s)]
*  I would anticipate the Persian Gulf war will begin anew. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=35.52s)]
*  This one-off action can have unbelievably horrific consequences. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=40.9s)]
*  Number one, there will be dead Americans, dead civilian Americans as a result of this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  It's not just service members. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  All American citizens are now walking prime targets for Iranian retaliation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=53.8s)]
*  And some Democrats even accusing Trump of using the airstrike to distract from impeachment. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Squad member Ilhan Omar tweeting, so what if Trump wants war, knows this leads to war and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  needs the distraction? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=71.32s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=72.32s)]
*  The distraction. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=73.8s)]
*  Pete, typically when there is something like this, the country comes together, you put [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=75.28s)]
*  Of course, they can have the debate if the president should declare war. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=81.28s)]
*  But accusing the president of using this for a block for impeachment? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=85.2s)]
*  Oh, but Trump, I mean the whole idea of him being the commander in chief. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=89.4s)]
*  There was a commentator today that said, right action, wrong commander in chief. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  And ultimately it doesn't matter the decision that he made. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=99.12s)]
*  No, that was literally Jonathan Alter on another network said that, said correct. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=101.48s)]
*  The implication is I'd rather have the correct commander in chief, meaning Hillary Clinton, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  in the wrong actions. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=109.88s)]
*  And it sums up precisely how everyone who isn't a supporter of this, the haters of the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=111.52s)]
*  president view him. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=116.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter what he does, we're going to dislike him. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=117.24s)]
*  The reality is though, the commentary there is true. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=119.72s)]
*  He made the right call. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=122.52s)]
*  He made a call based on advisors around him who believe this is an imminent threat. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=123.92s)]
*  And specifically because he saw a policy action taken under the Obama administration where [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=128.4s)]
*  sovereign American soil, whether it's a consulate or an embassy, was threatened and not taken [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=132.76s)]
*  seriously. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=137.84s)]
*  And that was based by an internet video by the national security advisor later on. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=138.84s)]
*  Ultimately he said, if you're going to try that, and we know what Iran does. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=142.6s)]
*  Iran 40 years ago used the American embassy in Tehran as the launching off point for their [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=146.04s)]
*  Islamic Republic. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=150.96s)]
*  Embassies are meaningful to them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=152.28s)]
*  It's sovereign American soil. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=153.28s)]
*  He said this will not happen again. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=154.88s)]
*  And as a result, I see the signs in front of me and I'm going to compensate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=156.84s)]
*  I'm going to send the Marines. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=161.08s)]
*  I'm going to send the 82nd Airborne, which he did by the way, knowing they had intelligence [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=162.08s)]
*  son, Soleimani, that looked like a bit of a bigger reaction than people thought as a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=166.36s)]
*  result. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=170.36s)]
*  But they knew what was coming next. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=171.36s)]
*  So this was something that was intentional because he didn't imagine if he hadn't acted [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=172.44000000000003s)]
*  the amount of negligence he'd be charged with knowing about the gathering threat and not [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  stepping up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=181.5s)]
*  If there really was a different imminent threat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=182.5s)]
*  I mean, there have been imminent threats from Soleimani for decades, for over a decade. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  We know that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=187.68s)]
*  That's why I keep harping on actually wanting to hear more about this because I think the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=188.68s)]
*  deserve the knowledge about why this time was different with all of the potential downsides [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=192.82s)]
*  that will come from this strike. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=198.98s)]
*  Look, I know. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=200.98s)]
*  Like Gaddafi in 2011, like there are lots of downsides that came from that too. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=201.98s)]
*  But we're not talking about 2011. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=205.34s)]
*  We're talking about today and President Trump. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=206.82s)]
*  Why can't you just step back and say, this is a bad guy who's dead and that's a good [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=209.22s)]
*  thing? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  Because I think the consequences that come from it could have far reaching strategic [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  negative impacts on the United States that outweigh the benefit from it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=216.82s)]
*  This is the most consequential decision that an American administration has taken in the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=219.94s)]
*  Middle East since the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  And I just haven't seen the kind of strategic planning from the Trump administration that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=226.78s)]
*  makes me think they know what comes next. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=230.62s)]
*  It's one thing to say, you need more information, but you have Obama, former administration [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=232.38s)]
*  officials like Ben Rhodes saying that they question the president's strategy and his [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=238.26s)]
*  competence to lead. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  I do too. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  And so that's going to happen and presidents can't worry about it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  They have to be able to make decisions based on the information that they have, their responsibility [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=248.78s)]
*  that they have and the timing and then history will figure that out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=253.66s)]
*  That's not for them to worry about right now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  The other thing is if there had been an attack based on something that the president knew [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=260.22s)]
*  about and he didn't act, then what do you think all the 2020 Democrats would have said [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  instead? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=268.58s)]
*  It would have been a much different conversation because they would have said how much tougher [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=269.58s)]
*  they would be. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=272.82s)]
*  So it's kind of difficult when these things are happening in the middle of a presidential [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=273.82s)]
*  election. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=276.74s)]
*  There's a point that Ilhan Omar, the congressman from Michigan said, or Minnesota, excuse me, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=277.74s)]
*  that said that maybe President Trump was just trying to create a distraction. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=282.02s)]
*  I think you could arguably say that from September to now, the biggest distraction in America [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=285.18s)]
*  has been impeachment. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=290.7s)]
*  That was actually a distraction. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=292.7s)]
*  And I also think that there is more strategy behind this because of something you pointed [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=295.14s)]
*  out Pete, that in April of 2019, the Trump administration designates Soleimani and his [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  group as a terrorist organization. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=306.82s)]
*  I think that probably you will look back and find as the history is written about this [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=309.38s)]
*  time that there was a lot more strategy to it than we thought. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=314.17999999999995s)]
*  But you can't plan everything out. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  And so yes, we need to know where things are going. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=318.78s)]
*  And I think that the point I'd like to make is the fact that when people say that this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=320.9s)]
*  is the escalation, what have the Iranians been doing? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=324.17999999999995s)]
*  They have been steadily escalating and become more bolder with their aggressive actions [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=327.52s)]
*  against us, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  Starting with the oil tankers and then the oil processing facilities and then U.S. positions [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=333.66s)]
*  and then an all out attack in Kirkuk that killed a U.S. contractor and then an attack [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  on the U.S. embassy. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  So I also don't understand why all of a sudden out of the blue, we question the U.S. intelligence [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  community when apparently, especially in domestic matters, they are to be absolutely believed [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=349.66s)]
*  at all points. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  It's only because of Trump's involvement that all of a sudden we're not to believe them, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  we're not to trust them. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=359.22s)]
*  When they have, the intelligence community has come out, they strongly indicated that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=360.22s)]
*  a major attack necessitated a preemption with this risk. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=363.88000000000005s)]
*  So why now all of a sudden do we need more information? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=367.66s)]
*  If coupled with Iranian behavior and decisions in these last year or so has escalated, why [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=371.62s)]
*  wouldn't we believe that? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRw0E7qRvB8&t=377.74s)]
