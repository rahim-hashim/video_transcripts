# Gutfeld dings Jen Psaki, calls her a ‘robotic Raggedy Ann'
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0)
*  Stop the fascists now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Stop the fascists now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=5.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=9.0s)]
*  That, my friends, is the sound of a defeated party. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=11.0s)]
*  Democrats once again breaking out the off-key protest tunes [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=13.0s)]
*  wailing against Elon Musk and President Trump [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=16.0s)]
*  as they stare down political extinction. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=19.0s)]
*  But there may be a way out of the wilderness. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=21.0s)]
*  The Democrats gathered a bunch of their super-rich billionaire buddies [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=24.0s)]
*  and left-wing influencers, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=27.0s)]
*  reps from Soros Fund Management [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=29.0s)]
*  and the company behind the Obama Podbros, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=31.0s)]
*  to Frankenstein themselves a left-wing Joe Rogan [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=34.0s)]
*  and fix their media game that's getting beat by the Republicans. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=37.0s)]
*  And Jen Psaki thinks the party's problem [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=41.0s)]
*  is that they all talk like your creepy left-wing college professor. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=43.0s)]
*  Which drives me crazy is the way sometimes Democrats talk. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=47.0s)]
*  It drives me insane. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=51.0s)]
*  It's like we're in a PhD thesis on political academia, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=52.0s)]
*  which is not how you win elections. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=55.0s)]
*  You said it's so funny because I wrote it down. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=57.0s)]
*  Democrats talk like we are junk professors [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=59.0s)]
*  at a small liberal arts college of the Midwest, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=61.0s)]
*  which I'm sure I would love a small liberal arts college of the Midwest, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=64.0s)]
*  but like that's not how most people talk. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=67.0s)]
*  I've heard her talk like a creepy college professor. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=71.0s)]
*  Circle back? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=73.0s)]
*  That robotic raggedy Ann forced circle back into our lexicon. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=75.0s)]
*  Try using circle back at the hardware store. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=80.0s)]
*  I'll circle you back out the door. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=83.0s)]
*  What was I going to say? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=85.0s)]
*  Oh, here we are. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=88.0s)]
*  You know, they're complaining about not having their own Joe Rogan [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=89.0s)]
*  and building a new one, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=93.0s)]
*  but they were chasing smart, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=95.0s)]
*  free-thinking people like Rogan out of the party. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=98.0s)]
*  Musk, RFK, Tulsi. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=102.0s)]
*  Why bother creating a new Joe Rogan if you're going to chase him out? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=104.0s)]
*  Worse, whoever is going to meet your criteria, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=109.0s)]
*  which is going to be this narrow little box [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=112.0s)]
*  because you're severely emotional about everything, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=117.0s)]
*  it's not going to be Joe Rogan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=120.0s)]
*  It's going to be like David Hogg, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=122.0s)]
*  you know, something so pathetic, Zeta male. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=124.0s)]
*  So my advice is you can't do Rogan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=129.0s)]
*  You can't do your own five if you adhere to a structure [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=131.0s)]
*  dictated by this hyper emotional militancy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=134.0s)]
*  How can you have a conversation with anyone [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=138.0s)]
*  if pronouns are litigated? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=140.0s)]
*  You know, you've seen what this kind of thinking, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=142.0s)]
*  this woke thinking has done to sports, entertainment, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=144.0s)]
*  even relationships. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=147.0s)]
*  You can't have a quote conversation that you always want [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=149.0s)]
*  if no one wants to talk to you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=152.0s)]
*  And it is hard, Dana, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=154.0s)]
*  if you're going to hide the truth from everybody to do it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=156.0s)]
*  on an hour to two to three hour podcast. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=159.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, but also, why do they need to create a new media ecosystem? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=162.0s)]
*  They already own the entire media ecosystem, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=166.0s)]
*  unless they're saying that the ecosystem is dying [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=168.0s)]
*  and maybe they are admitting that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=171.0s)]
*  I remember during my White House days, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=173.0s)]
*  they tried, I think it was called Air America, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=175.0s)]
*  It was like Al Franken, Rachel Maddow and everything. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=177.0s)]
*  They tried this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=180.0s)]
*  And to your point, it didn't work. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=181.0s)]
*  But also, at least then you have to have somebody who is one curious. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=183.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan is curious. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=187.0s)]
*  He can sit down for three hours and ask you questions [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=189.0s)]
*  because he's just like, what about this and what about that? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=192.0s)]
*  I don't think there's anyone really on the left that comes to mind. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=194.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe Bill Maher is separate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=199.0s)]
*  I don't put him really in that category. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=201.0s)]
*  Somebody who is interesting, who makes you think, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=203.0s)]
*  who makes you go, oh, that's a good point. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=205.0s)]
*  I haven't thought about it that way. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=207.0s)]
*  If they could do that, then they might be able to appeal to more people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=209.0s)]
*  Well, that's a good point because there's so many third rails on the left, Harold. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=212.0s)]
*  You know, you can't talk about corporate America. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=216.0s)]
*  You can't talk about the Pentagon. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=219.0s)]
*  You know, you can't talk about gender. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=221.0s)]
*  There's so many things you can't say. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=223.0s)]
*  I think we need to get away from that paradigm. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=225.0s)]
*  I think what we're seeing, every president who is popular, who gets elected, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=228.0s)]
*  has these kind of moments. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=233.0s)]
*  President Trump is, I would argue, is more pronounced [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=234.0s)]
*  in how he has been able to take advantage of these five weeks. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=237.0s)]
*  In my lifetime, I've not seen a president do what he has done and is continuing to do, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=241.0s)]
*  which is why I think Democrats have to be more patient. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=246.0s)]
*  But being patient doesn't mean you should be in a state of inertia. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=249.0s)]
*  This idea about trying to find a new media means or new media platforms, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=254.0s)]
*  you first have to start with substance. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=259.0s)]
*  And when you have substance, it's easier to find skill and a platform to be able to transfer [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=262.0s)]
*  and to communicate those ideas. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=269.0s)]
*  Imagine if Democrats began to think about a plan to reinvigorate [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=271.0s)]
*  and stimulate small businesses in rural and urban America and blue collar workers. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=274.0s)]
*  Imagine if we offered a 21st Century Lift Every Child Act, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=278.0s)]
*  which empowered parents, gave kids real opportunities, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=281.0s)]
*  reduced the power of teachers, and said, we're going to do something, Dana, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=285.0s)]
*  which you've talked a lot about, two-year opportunities after high school, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=288.0s)]
*  not just for college, but to give people skills and understanding. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=292.0s)]
*  If we're going to bring more jobs back to America, Jesse, and produce more things here, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=294.0s)]
*  we have to have engineers and people with skill sets to be able to do it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=299.0s)]
*  One of the worries I have is if President Trump is successful with this TAF program, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=303.0s)]
*  which I'm still not convinced he will be, but if he's able to bring all of these companies [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=307.0s)]
*  to produce things here, we're still going to have to import people [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=311.0s)]
*  because they don't have the resources to do it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=314.0s)]
*  This is what Democrats need to be focused on. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=317.0s)]
*  I'll say one last thing. I watched the President. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=319.0s)]
*  One thing that concerns me a little bit, I saw the President, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=321.0s)]
*  and I saw Mr. Rubio and Mr. Witkoff, who I'm impressed with, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=324.0s)]
*  and Mike Waltz there in Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=327.0s)]
*  And I hope I heard something wrong, and I'm not hearing it all right. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=330.0s)]
*  It sounds like without having the Europeans and Ukrainians there, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=333.0s)]
*  and Democrats ought to talk about this, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=337.0s)]
*  Lindsey Graham talked a little bit about it, who's a Republican, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=338.0s)]
*  it sounds like we're trying to split the world up between China, Russia, and ourselves. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=340.0s)]
*  And I don't want that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=344.0s)]
*  And if Democrats or some Republicans don't want it or Democrats don't want it, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=346.0s)]
*  these are the kinds of substantive things we should be saying. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=349.0s)]
*  This nonsense about how we talk, it doesn't matter. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=353.0s)]
*  If you don't have anything to say, it doesn't matter how you say it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=357.0s)]
*  If we don't have anything to say right now, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=359.0s)]
*  so step back and get some ideas. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=361.0s)]
*  Better ideas beat stupid ideas. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=364.0s)]
*  And right now, we don't even have stupid ideas. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=366.0s)]
*  We don't have anything to say. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=368.0s)]
*  Judge Janine. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=370.0s)]
*  You know, the irony is that Joe Rogan was a Democrat. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=372.0s)]
*  They had him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=375.0s)]
*  He was in their tent. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=376.0s)]
*  And now we've got the big tent. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=378.0s)]
*  And in our tent, we've got RFK, a Democrat, Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=380.0s)]
*  And the Democrat tent has a bouncer in front. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=384.0s)]
*  And if you're not not so feral, you know, totally progressive, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=388.0s)]
*  you're not getting in that tent. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=392.0s)]
*  And so they can complain about the messaging and they can say, you know, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=394.0s)]
*  we don't have a right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=398.0s)]
*  It's Harold is right. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=399.0s)]
*  It's all about the policy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=400.0s)]
*  It's not about the message. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=402.0s)]
*  So as they decide, well, what we're going to do is we're going to get the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=403.0s)]
*  billionaires together. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=406.0s)]
*  We're going to create our own Joe Rogan. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=407.0s)]
*  That's ridiculous because Joe Rogan is authentic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=409.0s)]
*  He is genuine. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=412.0s)]
*  He is curious. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=414.0s)]
*  He has politicians. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=416.0s)]
*  He has experts. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=417.0s)]
*  He has controversial people. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=418.0s)]
*  And he is someone who, you know, wants to have a real dialogue. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=420.0s)]
*  The Democrats don't want to have a real dialogue. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=424.0s)]
*  They want to decide who's going to talk, what they're going to say, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=427.0s)]
*  what you're allowed to say. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=431.0s)]
*  And God forbid you say something in a way that they don't think you should [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=433.0s)]
*  say it, then you're done. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=436.0s)]
*  So they can throw all the money in the world that they're next, hopefully, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=438.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=441.0s)]
*  It didn't work for Hillary Clinton. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=442.0s)]
*  It didn't work for Kamala Harris. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=444.0s)]
*  And it's not going to work here because the Democrats are out of touch and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=445.0s)]
*  Americans want real conversations. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=449.0s)]
*  I wish the Democrats talked about creating a Democrat, Jesse Waters. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=451.0s)]
*  What would that be? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=454.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=455.0s)]
*  Who would that be? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=456.0s)]
*  Keith Olbermann? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=457.0s)]
*  We could do better than that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=458.0s)]
*  Up next, the media is trying to pin the plane crash on Canada on President [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=460.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=463.0s)]
*  We could do better than that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUVk21RLdP0&t=464.0s)]
