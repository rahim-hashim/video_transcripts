# Gutfeld reveals why he wants to see more of Jasmine Crockett
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o)
*  First they cursed, now they thirst for blood. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=0.0s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett is upping her temper tantrums, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=4.34s)]
*  now saying the only way Democrats can win elections [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=6.84s)]
*  is by throwing hands. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=9.72s)]
*  I think you punch. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=12.0s)]
*  I think you're okay with punching. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=12.96s)]
*  It's Ted Cruz. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=15.16s)]
*  I mean, like this dude has to be knocked over the head, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=16.48s)]
*  like hard, right? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=19.56s)]
*  Like there is no niceties with him, like at all. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=21.32s)]
*  Like you go clean off on him, right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  So much for Michelle Obama's, when they go low, we go high. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=26.92s)]
*  Crockett went as low as humanly possible [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=31.84s)]
*  by mocking Governor Greg Abbott for being paralyzed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=34.28s)]
*  We in these hot, Texas streets, honey. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=38.08s)]
*  Y'all know we got Governor Hot Wheels down there, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=43.88s)]
*  come on now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=46.16s)]
*  And the only thing hot about him [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  is that he is a hot mess, honey. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  So. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=54.16s)]
*  Of course Crockett now claims Hot Wheels [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=55.28s)]
*  was about shipping migrants out of the state. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=58.64s)]
*  Don't you get that? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=61.32s)]
*  Not the governor's condition. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=62.32s)]
*  If only there was video that perfectly encapsulates [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=64.16s)]
*  the liberal inability to land a lick on MAGA. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=66.44s)]
*  Turns out we have one, roll it Bjorn. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=69.4s)]
*  He's a racist. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=72.36s)]
*  I'm so okay with it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=73.2s)]
*  How can I be racist? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  He's a racist. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=74.88s)]
*  I'm so okay with it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=75.72s)]
*  He's you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=76.56s)]
*  I'm okay with it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=77.4s)]
*  I'm okay with it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm so okay with it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=79.08s)]
*  I hope you enjoy that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=79.92s)]
*  I hope you enjoy that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=80.76s)]
*  I hope you enjoy that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=81.6s)]
*  Oh she's like a attacker. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=82.44s)]
*  Oh she just. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=84.28s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=85.12s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=86.8s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=87.62s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  Never get tired of that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=89.3s)]
*  So Dana, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=90.64s)]
*  Governor Hot Wheels, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=93.16s)]
*  she claims that it had nothing to do with the fact [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  that he actually moves by wheels in a wheelchair [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=97.4s)]
*  and he's good looking. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Her cleanup was worse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=102.08s)]
*  That was one of the worst things I've ever seen. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=104.72s)]
*  It was super dumb. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  So basically she's saying, I didn't do it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=107.08s)]
*  And if I did do it though, we're the victims of it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=110.0s)]
*  And I think that the Democrats have a problem. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=114.56s)]
*  Remember Maxine Waters back in 2019 and 2020. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=118.08s)]
*  She had all of those things of get up in their faces. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=121.56s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  And that was actually really helpful for Republicans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=124.8s)]
*  And it helped over the years to bring more people, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=127.88s)]
*  like the young people we're talking about over yesterday, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=132.52s)]
*  over to the Republican side of things. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=135.4s)]
*  You know, Richard, I don't know about you, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=138.3s)]
*  but I want to see way more of Jasmine Crockett. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=139.58s)]
*  I want to see her everywhere. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=142.56s)]
*  I think she is the perfect face [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=144.24s)]
*  of the modern Democrat party. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=146.28s)]
*  What say you? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=147.8s)]
*  I do think that there are a lot of Democrats [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  that really like Jasmine Crockett. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=150.4s)]
*  But let's be very clear here and let's acknowledge [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  that the name calling is on both sides of the aisle. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=153.44s)]
*  Everybody does it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=155.48s)]
*  It gins up the base. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=156.88s)]
*  I mean, I think we can go through Donald Trump's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=158.12s)]
*  greatest hits of name calling and we can go bull for blow. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=159.68s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump, and to be fair, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=162.16s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure, I want to say he attacked [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=164.4s)]
*  a mentally challenged reporter once, but we can go through. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=166.56s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=168.88s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=169.72s)]
*  Once again, I think if we were to go to the list [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=170.8s)]
*  of who did more name calling, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  I think Donald Trump would win that list. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  But either way, let's go. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  He didn't denigrate somebody in a wheelchair. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about the issues. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  So today, consumer confidence, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=180.4s)]
*  the consumer confidence numbers came out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  And what those numbers point to is a sharp decline [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  amongst Americans on how they feel [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  about their own financial situation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  And the two things that the report points to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  is both tariffs and inflation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=193.4s)]
*  And I think this is an opportunity for Democrats, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  Because right now, I think the Democratic party [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=197.5s)]
*  has the lowest approval rating that they've had in decades. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  And I think this should be an opportunity for Democrats [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=202.04s)]
*  to talk about how they will have a plan [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=204.04s)]
*  to move the country forward. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  In the 2024 election, Democrats spent a lot of time [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  talking about how terrible Project 2025 was. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  And they didn't offer their own plan [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=213.16s)]
*  about how they want to move the country forward. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  I think that's what there's a lot of voters [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=216.0s)]
*  looking to the Democratic party saying, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=217.64s)]
*  what are you going to do? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  Why aren't you fighting hard enough? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=219.92s)]
*  Why aren't you doing that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=221.16s)]
*  Well, that's why there's all this ire against Chuck Schumer [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=222.0s)]
*  and others on Capitol Hill. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=224.32s)]
*  Because we hear a lot of, we don't like Trump, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  or whatever Trump does, blank, we hate it, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=227.56s)]
*  instead of saying, what are we going to do, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=229.92s)]
*  to what are you going to do to make my life better [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=232.12s)]
*  because I'm feeling pain because the price of eggs [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=233.68s)]
*  are too high, the price of bacon is too high right now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  We did a story earlier today on the channel [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=237.12s)]
*  about how the price of toys are too high. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=239.52s)]
*  Eggs are down, gas is down. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=241.64s)]
*  Those are two big deals. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=243.2s)]
*  But it's still too high. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=244.2s)]
*  It's funny, because eggs give me gas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=245.48s)]
*  Sure, they might. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=247.32s)]
*  But this is about how Democrats can move forward [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=248.28s)]
*  and win over back their voters, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=250.68s)]
*  because their voters want to fight a little bit harder. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=252.12s)]
*  So lie is what you're saying. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=253.96s)]
*  They need to lie about the gas. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=254.8s)]
*  I think they should come up with a plan [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=255.64s)]
*  that allows them to speak to the pain [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=257.16s)]
*  that the American people are feeling. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=259.04s)]
*  Because if the consumer confidence numbers [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=260.48s)]
*  point to the fact that tariffs and inflation [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=262.24s)]
*  are harming consumer confidence, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=265.0s)]
*  actually the lowest it's been in 12 years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=266.32000000000005s)]
*  Neither of them have been affected by Trump [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=268.8s)]
*  in terms of raising inflation or the tariffs in action anyway. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=271.88000000000005s)]
*  But anyway, Judge, what do you say you? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=274.48s)]
*  Well, I think if you want to talk about the Dems, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=276.6s)]
*  I think the first thing we should do [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  is focus on the fact that they were the ones [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=281.56s)]
*  behind that summer of love and the peaceful protests [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=283.88s)]
*  when they were burning down cities and federal courthouses [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=287.96s)]
*  and Tesla now and, you know, from, as Dana said, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=292.4s)]
*  Maxine Waters, you get in their face, you make a crowd, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=296.76s)]
*  to now punch out your opponent, too. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=300.92s)]
*  You got to knock them over the head like hard. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=303.76s)]
*  And, you know, she didn't clean up that Hot Wheels [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=307.0s)]
*  about Greg Hammett. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  But then again, it's like what the Democrats do. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=311.92s)]
*  Joe Biden's the one who told the paraplegic, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  stand up, Chuck, let them see you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=316.88s)]
*  I just think that, you know, they are so lost [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=320.16s)]
*  and they just have no idea how to come back. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  They're cursing, they're fighting, they're burning. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=327.92s)]
*  They're lost. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=330.72s)]
*  I said it months ago, the party is over. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=331.6s)]
*  They've got to come up with something new. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  And this woman chasing a guy in, that's New York City. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=336.68s)]
*  That's a subway. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=340.28s)]
*  In New York City, you can wear a MAGA hat. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=341.28s)]
*  It's not a problem anymore. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=343.52s)]
*  The Democrats are the ones who make fools of themselves, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=344.76s)]
*  which is one of the reasons why Donald Trump won. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=347.64s)]
*  Jesse, you know, they call Musk a Nazi. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  And next thing you know, you got squat stickers on cars. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=356.44s)]
*  They called Trump Hitler and a Nazi and a fascist [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=358.84s)]
*  and he got shot. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  So I don't really ever see that happening [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=363.55999999999995s)]
*  on the Republican side. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=365.64s)]
*  When we make fun of Democrats, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=366.96s)]
*  it's also about the supporters. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=368.72s)]
*  It's not just the leaders. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=371.6s)]
*  It seems like Democrats are easily programmed [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=373.6s)]
*  to do bad things. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=375.8s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=376.92s)]
*  They're very easily programmed, Greg. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=378.32000000000005s)]
*  I made you say that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=380.68s)]
*  I don't really care what she says, you know, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  if she wants to make a joke about Hot Wheels. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=384.56s)]
*  It just makes her look bad. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=386.44000000000005s)]
*  And they shouldn't censor her [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  because I want to reserve the right [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=389.8s)]
*  to make fun of other people, okay? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  We should all have freedom of speech [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  and you shouldn't get censored because you say something. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  And if she says, we got to punch him, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=399.24s)]
*  knock him over the head, we say that stuff all the time. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=401.32s)]
*  It's a euphemism for fighting harder. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=404.0s)]
*  Richard brings up the point though. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=406.12s)]
*  He wants to see them fight harder. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=408.04s)]
*  Fight harder for what? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=409.32s)]
*  What's the plan? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=411.04s)]
*  You keep bringing up- [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=412.04s)]
*  Because the cost of rent's too high? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=413.2s)]
*  You had four years to come up with a plan. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=414.04s)]
*  If you had a plan, you would have said it already. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=416.04s)]
*  You don't have a plan. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=419.52s)]
*  Your plan backfired. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=420.88s)]
*  You drove the cost of living up to like 30 year highs. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=423.08s)]
*  And then your plan was to do nothing and blame Russia. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=426.8s)]
*  They don't have a plan. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=430.24s)]
*  They're never gonna come up with the plan. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=431.44s)]
*  So to say that they want this and they want that, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=433.52s)]
*  they don't want it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=436.12s)]
*  They just want to get out of responsibility. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  They just want to look better for their voters. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  That's all this is, to look better [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=443.12s)]
*  so their voters aren't mad at them. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=445.08s)]
*  Because now their voters are just as mad at Trump [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=446.96s)]
*  as they are with Chuck Schumer. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=449.79999999999995s)]
*  That's your problem. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=451.64s)]
*  You guys don't think. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  You don't have any ideas. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=454.56s)]
*  Having an idea is different than being against [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=455.76s)]
*  what Trump wants. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=458.52s)]
*  Being against Trump's not an idea. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=459.88s)]
*  It's a lifestyle. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=463.2s)]
*  It's a lifestyle. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  For Democrats. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=465.28s)]
*  That's a great idea for a magazine, against Trump. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=466.2s)]
*  It's like how to live your life totally against Trump. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=468.36s)]
*  And be like- [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=471.32s)]
*  The kind of deal with your bruises [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  when you fall in the subway trying to take someone's Maggots. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=473.0s)]
*  I think it's called Teen Vogue. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=474.52s)]
*  Coming up, the anti-Mouse Democrats have a new target. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBtgtL8o3o&t=476.88s)]
