# ‘The Five’: The media can't handle ‘Chainsaw Musk’
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M)
*  It's the Doge chainsaw massacre. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk crashing CPAC while literally wielding a golden chainsaw given to him by Argentina's [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=2.6s)]
*  president. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=9.1s)]
*  A symbolic gesture for the cost-cutting crew that has already saved taxpayers billions. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=10.1s)]
*  The world's richest man acting cool and casual as he dismantled his Democrat critics who [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=15.52s)]
*  have been protesting his every move. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=21.22s)]
*  This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=25.28s)]
*  Chainsaw! [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=29.48s)]
*  Obviously, it just shows that they really lack empathy for the average taxpayer who's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=30.48s)]
*  working hard paying taxes and then they say, oh, a million dollars doesn't matter. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=37.04s)]
*  I'm like, I think it matters a lot, people, you know? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=41.6s)]
*  So what are you talking about? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=44.2s)]
*  People ask, how can you find waste in DC? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=46.0s)]
*  I'm like, look, it's like being in a room and this target, the wall, the roofs and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=49.6s)]
*  the floor are all targets. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=54.68s)]
*  So it's like, you're going to close your eyes and go shoot in any direction. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=56.4s)]
*  Because you can't miss. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  But the liberal media is so easily triggered by the sight of Chainsaw Musk. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=62.36s)]
*  You unleash somebody who's doing theatrics and abandoning his own children and having [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=73.32s)]
*  some weird fantasy in front of everybody to be popular. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=77.64s)]
*  Just do whatever he wants to do with no oversight. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=81.16s)]
*  That is anti-American and it's reckless and it's wrong. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=83.8s)]
*  Chainsaw Musk? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=87.96s)]
*  Yeah, it was absurd, but it was also a flex of a man who has absolutely no idea what he's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=88.96s)]
*  doing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=97.88s)]
*  You know, you live by the chainsaw, die by the chainsaw. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=98.88s)]
*  Trump and his MAGA allies are treating their firings inside the government like a game, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  a show even. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=106.36s)]
*  They are creating memes, throwing celebrations. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=107.48s)]
*  And the man in charge is using props to dance on professional graves. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=110.28s)]
*  They can whine all they want, but President Trump is sticking with his extremely high [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  IQ Doge team. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=120.64s)]
*  Elon is doing a really good job. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=123.76s)]
*  And I said, who are these people that travel? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  We call them the Dogers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  And I said, what are they? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=129.96s)]
*  He said, they're generally young people with extremely high IQs who are very good with [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=130.96s)]
*  Because you have to be good with computers. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=136.4s)]
*  We're actually going to Fort Knox because I want to see, do we have the gold? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=138.12s)]
*  Do we still have whatever it is, tons of gold? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=141.24s)]
*  I hope we do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't that be disappointing? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  Fort Knox, you grew up hearing about Fort Knox. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  You can't get in. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=150.88s)]
*  You can't even see it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=151.88s)]
*  Nobody sees it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=153.56s)]
*  You go there and the place is dry. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=154.56s)]
*  Would that be terrible? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=157.16s)]
*  All right, Jesse, you know, the Democrat malcontents are out there saying, you know, that Elon [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=158.16s)]
*  Musk has no oversight. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=164.48s)]
*  It's anti-American. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=166.68s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=168.04s)]
*  He has no idea what he's doing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=169.04s)]
*  I mean, the guy who bought Twitter took it down like by 70 percent and is still doing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=170.2s)]
*  well with it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=174.72s)]
*  And he's like the probably the most successful businessman in the year. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=175.72s)]
*  And Congress hasn't done any oversight that can show $55 billion in two weeks. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=180.2s)]
*  No, he's done more with a chainsaw than Congress has done with their own powers in decades. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=184.52s)]
*  The chainsaw was a gift. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=189.32s)]
*  It would be rude not to brandish it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=191.56s)]
*  And who gave it to him? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=195.08s)]
*  The guy from Argentina who's used it very well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=196.08s)]
*  He saved his own country from bankruptcy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=198.2s)]
*  Argentina should make the chainsaw the national bird. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=200.96s)]
*  I don't even care if the thing doesn't fly. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=203.2s)]
*  We are $36 trillion in the hole. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=206.32s)]
*  And you keep hearing Democrats talk about, oh, we need a scalpel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=208.4s)]
*  It's like they think that's some clever analogy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=211.68s)]
*  When's the last time you heard a Democrat use a scalpel on anything besides their own [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=214.6s)]
*  face? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=220.12s)]
*  This is a serious debt crisis we're in. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=221.4s)]
*  You definitely need a chainsaw. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=224.84s)]
*  Democrats haven't balanced the budget in 25 years. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=227.04s)]
*  And that was only because Newt helped them out. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=229.56s)]
*  But I do worry about Elon, Judge. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=232.08s)]
*  You know how these NBA stars or NFL stars have clauses in their contract and their offseason? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=234.12s)]
*  They're not allowed to go skiing or ride a motorcycle or even play pickup basketball [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=239.44s)]
*  because it's too risky. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=244.28s)]
*  They get hurt and lose everything. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  Elon's board of directors should not allow him to be juggling a chainsaw. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=248.6s)]
*  He slips and falls, cuts his head off. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=254.0s)]
*  We're in a recession. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=256.52s)]
*  Or if he castrates himself, the world population plummets. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=257.52s)]
*  These are memes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=263.6s)]
*  And he's serious about that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=265.86s)]
*  He's got the shades. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=267.24s)]
*  He's got the chain. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=268.24s)]
*  He's got the chainsaw. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=269.24s)]
*  We saw how effective this was with the mugshot, with the McDonald's, with the trash truck. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=270.54s)]
*  These things are powerful. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=277.4s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, what is he holding? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=278.76s)]
*  An avocado? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=280.12s)]
*  It's just not the same thing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=281.67999999999995s)]
*  You know, Jessica, both James Carville and I think Van Jones, you know, they're very [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=283.84s)]
*  critical of this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=289.4s)]
*  And Carville says, oh, Democrats, just, you know, sit back. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=290.67999999999995s)]
*  The Republican collapse is on the way. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump and Elon are happy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  They're smiling. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=299.23999999999995s)]
*  The Democrats are just miserable. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=300.32s)]
*  I don't feel miserable. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  I feel challenged. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=304.32s)]
*  This is a tough moment, figuring out how to navigate what Trump 2.0 looks like. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=305.6s)]
*  But what James Carville is referring to is this huge drop in support for President Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  and for Elon Musk and what he's doing at Doge. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  So there were a bunch of polls that came out. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=317.8s)]
*  CNN has two to one people are upset about Musk having such a prominent role in the government. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=319.56s)]
*  Trump's approval rating is down five to seven points across four of these big polls. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  He's underwater on managing the economy, which is obviously what handed him the presidency, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  eight points underwater. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=334.68s)]
*  And then in terms of how the public is feeling, not only reflected in those numbers, did you [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  see those town halls that were going on last night? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=340.6s)]
*  So Rich McCormick in Georgia, safe seat, people booing him, catcalling. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  They're concerned with everything from spending cuts to what's going on with Doge to that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=348.08s)]
*  Donald Trump is becoming a tyrant. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=352.76s)]
*  Cliff Benson, Oregon, similar reaction. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=354.92s)]
*  This guy, Tony Balderson, he's in a Trump plus 18 district in Ohio saying Trump's executive [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=357.68s)]
*  orders are getting out of control. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  They are hearing from the American public that what is going on from the Oval Office [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=365.44s)]
*  to CPAC, which is, you know, Pam Bondi being at CPAC seems like a politicization of the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=370.56s)]
*  office, to say the least, is not what the American public wanted. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=376.44000000000005s)]
*  They wanted someone to come in to get the economy back on track. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=379.92s)]
*  That hasn't been happening. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  They wanted a different vision of getting rid of illegal immigrants. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=385.12s)]
*  They wanted people who are actually convicted of crimes, really ones getting kicked out, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  not just picking up anyone who speaks Spanish. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=391.64s)]
*  So that's what Carville is saying. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  And I think it's a good strategy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=395.68s)]
*  Let it happen. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=397.4s)]
*  You know, Greg, I noticed that your eyebrows furrowed when Jessica says just not throwing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=398.2s)]
*  out everyone who speaks Spanish. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, the the whole point of this administration is that we agree that this that America needed [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=405.12s)]
*  change and they needed it now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=411.8s)]
*  We're willing to accept some hiccups. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  And our hiccups don't cost lives. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=415.8s)]
*  Right. It's not like bail reform where, hey, we're going to do this. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, we break a few eggs. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=421.6s)]
*  When you guys break eggs, people die. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  In this case, you know, you make a mistake, you rehire somebody. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=425.6s)]
*  The thing about the chainsaw, it's fun. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=428.48s)]
*  It's silly. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=430.8s)]
*  It's another light and ridiculous moment in this action movie that we're living in. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=431.8s)]
*  And if you find that chainsaw toxic or hyper masculine or insensitive or heartless, you [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=436.88s)]
*  have wandered into the wrong movie. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=443.8s)]
*  You know, you were probably you probably wanted to see The Notebook 4. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=446.20000000000005s)]
*  But this is part of the flip. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=449.68s)]
*  Forty years ago, it used to be, you know, the right was stiff and easily offended and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  the left was hip and edgy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=456.96s)]
*  It's completely shifted. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=458.24s)]
*  And the writer have rights, having fun. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=460.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Dems, you know, they're the Democratic Party is like a giant sized version [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=463.28s)]
*  of The View, if that's possible. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=468.28s)]
*  I mean, do you see any optimism? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=470.96s)]
*  Do you see any hope? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=472.84s)]
*  Do you see any action? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=473.84s)]
*  Do you see any solutions? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=474.96s)]
*  At least on The View, there's joy and what a joy it is. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=476.12s)]
*  But with the Democratic Party, it's all just misery and a hope for more misery, because [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=479.32s)]
*  then that'll bring down Trump. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  I was just watching. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=485.32s)]
*  Watch that clip. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  I just realized Brianna Keller has CNN resting face. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=486.92s)]
*  So in the issue, you know, Jessica brings up these these criticisms and you've got to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=491.88s)]
*  understand that stuff doesn't work anymore. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=496.6s)]
*  A lot of the load bearing phrases that we know he's racist, he's a fascist, he's acting [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=499.12s)]
*  like a king, he's transphobic, he's Hitler. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=505.8s)]
*  They don't resonate to the public anymore because they got burned by all that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=508.04s)]
*  And the arguments that depended on those words have all atrophied. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=512.32s)]
*  It worse. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=516.28s)]
*  The media vessels have been cauterized. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=518.16s)]
*  It used to be you'd get this little outrage and it would show up on Twitter that would [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=521.04s)]
*  go to a blog and then it would shoot its way up to the New York Times or The Washington [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=524.72s)]
*  Post, which is what happened with something like the Covington Kids. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=530.16s)]
*  That that vessel has been cauterized. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=533.6s)]
*  Nobody cares what's on the Daily Beast or media. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=536.9200000000001s)]
*  I they don't read that and nobody actually trusts it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=541.12s)]
*  So the big challenge for the Dems, the Trump movie is fun. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=544.28s)]
*  It's funny and it's fast and it's optimistic. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=548.4s)]
*  If the Dems were a movie, it would be morose, depressing and hopeless. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  You would call it the Jim Acosta story. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  Why are you know, Kayleigh, like this then if everyone is well, nobody's hearing about [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=559.28s)]
*  these town halls. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=563.0s)]
*  They are. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=563.72s)]
*  Let me go to all over the what? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=563.8s)]
*  It's all over the house. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=567.16s)]
*  OK, Kayleigh, let me go to you on this. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=569.76s)]
*  You know, don't you think it's rather ridiculous for the Democrats to be complaining? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=572.68s)]
*  It's just four weeks and the economy isn't better. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=577.5999999999999s)]
*  It's just four weeks and eggs haven't come down. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=581.28s)]
*  How ridiculous is that? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=584.64s)]
*  Totally ridiculous. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=586.0s)]
*  And, you know, Jessica, you point to an anecdotal town hall. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=587.12s)]
*  Well, let's get into some polling. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=589.64s)]
*  CBS, Falger, Rasmussen have him over 50 percent. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=591.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=594.64s)]
*  Recent CNN poll, the most popular Trump agenda item that has been accomplished is immigration. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=595.28s)]
*  In fact, 55 percent said he has gone either just the right amount or not far enough. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=601.12s)]
*  Not only that, I'm a nerd. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=607.12s)]
*  I spend my Fridays reading CNN cross tabs. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  When you dig into the cross tabs, people who feel there's an attack on democracy, that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=611.28s)]
*  number was 56 percent in 21. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=615.24s)]
*  That number was 54 percent in 2023. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=617.28s)]
*  You know what it's at now? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=619.96s)]
*  Forty five percent. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=621.0799999999999s)]
*  So this threat to democracy language that the left is still using, Biden was a bigger [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=622.76s)]
*  threat to democracy, a majority threat, according to a CNN poll. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=627.4s)]
*  And while on the note of CNN, just one more note, Karen Finney, the person who said Biden [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=631.12s)]
*  or Elon Musk, what experience do you have? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=635.76s)]
*  Karen Finney, you worked for the John Edwards campaign. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=638.24s)]
*  We never had a President Edwards. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=641.4s)]
*  You worked for the Hillary Clinton campaign. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=643.0s)]
*  We never had a President Hillary Clinton. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  Don't give me what experience does Elon Musk have. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=647.16s)]
*  I'll cite this SpaceX first private sector company to get a man in space. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=649.48s)]
*  Neuralink helping quadriplegic people to walk. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=653.6s)]
*  I'll take Elon Musk over Karen Finney in the CNN resting face crowd any day. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=656.28s)]
*  Digging in the cross tab. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=660.6s)]
*  Yeah, Friday. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=662.6s)]
*  I don't even know what a cross tab is. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=664.32s)]
*  I'll show you in your office. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=666.32s)]
*  Very angry soda. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=667.24s)]
*  Yes. Up next, Canada better watch out. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  President Trump is responding to Justin Trudeau squealing like a schoolgirl after [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=671.2s)]
*  winning the big hockey game. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwqXsEYm3M&t=676.48s)]
