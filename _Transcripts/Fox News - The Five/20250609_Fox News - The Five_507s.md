# 'The Five': 'WOKE DETOX' for Dems
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE)
*  2028 Democrats are scrubbing pronouns faster than Brian Stelter clears a Vegas buffet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=0.0s)]
*  Politico calls it the great unwokening Maryland Governor Wes Moore vetoed a bill on reparations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Greasy Gavin called transports unfair. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=12.16s)]
*  Mayor Pete ditched his pronouns. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  And Rom says stop talking about bathrooms. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=17.28s)]
*  Stop talking about bathrooms and locker rooms and start talking about the classroom. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=21.76s)]
*  If one child's trying to figure out their pronoun, I accept that, but the rest of the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=25.68s)]
*  class doesn't know what a pronoun is and can't even define it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=29.12s)]
*  But the woke detox won't fix squat if Dem's only idea is still orange man bad. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Seventy one percent of Democrats say their leaders are ineffective. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=40.64s)]
*  You are in Democratic leadership. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=44.6s)]
*  Why are they wrong? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=47.28s)]
*  So when you look at what's happening here, Trump is doing some really bad things to people, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=48.32s)]
*  right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=52.32s)]
*  Independence Republicans or Democrats are basically saying the same thing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=53.32s)]
*  They're really scared of what's happening right now to their families, and they want [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=55.9s)]
*  to see leadership. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=59.58s)]
*  So we cannot be the party of the status quo. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=60.78s)]
*  That is for certain. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=63.82s)]
*  I'm sure you're tired of having to answer this question every time you're on the show, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=64.82s)]
*  but it's because you never answer it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=69.5s)]
*  You see all these examples that we use how their rejection of pronouns, rejection of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=72.3s)]
*  reparations, rejection of men and women's sports. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=75.98s)]
*  What these little kind of desperate examples are, but there is no through line that tells [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=80.58s)]
*  you what they are for. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=86.86s)]
*  These are all like, yeah, we were already there, but what are you for? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=88.86s)]
*  What are you for? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=93.06s)]
*  I think you nailed it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=94.06s)]
*  I think it is important for Democrats to understand. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=96.18s)]
*  And I think Rahm is getting at a lot of it with some of the things you said, but we've [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=99.22s)]
*  been talking about it on this show now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=102.42s)]
*  And Dana sometimes says the Democrats never listen to me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=104.02s)]
*  They're starting to look like they're listening a little bit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=106.7s)]
*  And Wes Moore and others are starting to understand that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=109.06s)]
*  And Wes is a smart guy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=112.54s)]
*  I'm starting to understand first, President Trump won because of the border and because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=113.54s)]
*  of the economy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=117.62s)]
*  And wrapped into a lot of that was fears that people had about some of these cultural issues, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=118.62s)]
*  including the issues that we talk about around this table, including rights given to little [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=123.26s)]
*  boys and want to be girls over little girls and activities they do. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=127.5s)]
*  The president's gotten 50 percent of the border thing right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=131.1s)]
*  He has locked down the border. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=134.22s)]
*  The question now they're dealing with and we're seeing it play out in an ugly and violent [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=135.9s)]
*  way is the hierarchy of deportations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=139.06s)]
*  And I'm rooting for him to get that right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=140.86s)]
*  We need a good border security immigration bill. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=142.18s)]
*  Apparently, there's some money in this big, beautiful bill to do some of that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  But Democrats, if you're smart, we need an affordability agenda. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=147.38s)]
*  Talk about the things that everyday working class people who put Mr. Trump over the line [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=150.58s)]
*  in 16 and put him over the line in 2024. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  I would even argue Ronald Reagan, when he won, it were working class Democrats that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=158.34s)]
*  put him over the line. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  So we have to have an agenda that addresses that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=164.4s)]
*  The more we're concerned with pronouns, as the bottom of the screen says, the more we're [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=167.0s)]
*  concerned with protecting the rights of people who are hardened criminals, the less likely [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=171.08s)]
*  it is we're going to find our way back to the majority in the House and Senate and certainly [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=176.88s)]
*  less likely we'll find our way back to the White House. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=180.76s)]
*  But we look like we're on the better trajectory today than we were yesterday. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Kellyanne, Harold is talking about moving to the center. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=187.0s)]
*  But how can they move to the center if Trump occupies it? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=191.72s)]
*  They need to be deprogrammed of their never Trumpism before they can actually accept any [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=195.56s)]
*  of this common sense. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  The current Democratic Party is so left, they don't even see the center. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=202.76s)]
*  And it'd be one thing if you changed your mind, if you had a true awakening on a public [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=208.24s)]
*  policy issue. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=211.48s)]
*  It's not like these people, Greg, burned a bra or burned a flag at Woodstock when they [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=212.92s)]
*  were 19. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=216.88s)]
*  I said this last year when they were governors and in their 50s and 60s. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=217.88s)]
*  And this whole idea that they have changed their mind on something so significant and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=222.32s)]
*  I would say so obvious. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  No one's going to buy that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=229.28s)]
*  But you said the most important thing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  I challenge Democrats all the time, elected and unelected Democrats, and even independents. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=232.28s)]
*  Can you finish or start a sentence? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=237.32s)]
*  If I ask you, who are you? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  What do you believe in? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=241.34s)]
*  If you can finish and start a sentence without saying Donald Trump's name 10 times, you win [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  a prize. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=247.22s)]
*  I still have all the prizes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=248.22s)]
*  They're physiologically incapable of not saying Trump, Trump, Trump. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=249.32s)]
*  This is why vaccines for diseases include part of what you're allergic to. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=252.44s)]
*  In other words, you put it in there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=255.82s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome is so real for them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=258.18s)]
*  It's stage five, no cure, no therapeutic, no resolution. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=261.06s)]
*  The other thing is I learned everything about today's Democratic Party from the Democrats [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=265.9s)]
*  themselves. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=269.78s)]
*  And people in focus groups claw them out on it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=271.04s)]
*  We've lost a lot of union members, a lot of Catholics, a lot of rank and file folks because [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=273.26s)]
*  all those people burning down their cities that hurt the working men and working women. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=279.3s)]
*  This is not going to work. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=284.62s)]
*  Big beautiful bill, all this stuff. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=285.7s)]
*  In addition to the board inflation and migration, the big issue in the last election was fairness [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=286.86s)]
*  over wokeness. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=291.52s)]
*  And people say not fair to have plumbers and pipe fitters pay for student loans, doctors [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=292.52s)]
*  and lawyers student loans. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=296.62s)]
*  Not fair to have boys and women's sports. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=297.92s)]
*  Not fair to have 10 million people come here illegally. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=300.12s)]
*  And then we see them get clothes and cell phones in your kid's seat in a New York City [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=303.3s)]
*  classroom. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=307.7s)]
*  The Democrats are the ones who allowed men to penetrate the waters of women's pools as [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=309.08s)]
*  they held official positions. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=316.12s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to unpack that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=318.32s)]
*  I think the Democratic nominee is going to be someone no one's thinking about. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=319.32s)]
*  It's going to have to be a total outsider. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  They'll probably be unsuccessful, but they will be different. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=323.44s)]
*  It won't be anybody who was involved in this nonsense. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=325.88s)]
*  Dana, I think that Trump broke the Democratic Party because they thought so much about him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=328.76s)]
*  They stopped thinking about other issues. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  And I think Rahm Emanuel is hitting on that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  But also he had the benefit of being away. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  And being in Japan and he was like working every day as an ambassador. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=342.96s)]
*  He comes back and he's like, what has happened to this party? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  But I think that there's going to be some backlash against these moderating Democrats [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=348.88s)]
*  from the left flank because they're not for any of this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's where the energy in the party is. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  I also think that a lot of this continued fallout for the Democrats comes from short [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=357.32s)]
*  circuiting their primary by going back to Biden, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=360.64s)]
*  The original sin or however you want to call it, like their decision to have him run again. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=363.6s)]
*  And then only back out after it was quite obvious that he couldn't do it anymore. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  That is going to hurt them. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=371.76s)]
*  Plus, unwoking themselves. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=372.76s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris both signed questionnaires calling for taxpayer funded [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=374.48s)]
*  trans surgeries for detained illegal immigrants. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCUghaUbdjE&t=380.16s)]
