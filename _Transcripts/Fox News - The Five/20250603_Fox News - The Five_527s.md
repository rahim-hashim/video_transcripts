# ‘The Five’: Dems can’t walk back from this hoax
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U)
*  All right, so Dana, we're in June. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=0.0s)]
*  The election was a while ago. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=3.16s)]
*  We had tacos. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=5.32s)]
*  We have the sons giving them advice. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=7.2s)]
*  How do you think the Democrats are handling this? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=9.4s)]
*  I think this is a cue for producers everywhere, that this is a story we can do every day from [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=10.96s)]
*  now until the night of election night, 2028, because they dug themselves such a deep hole [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=16.36s)]
*  on the issues that people care about the most. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=21.64s)]
*  So inflation, still an issue, but getting a little bit better. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=23.64s)]
*  But people are still reminded they've been paying higher prices since after COVID. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=27.1s)]
*  You have the immigration issue. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  Every single day we are dealing with that, whether you can remember what happened at [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=32.94s)]
*  the border itself or you have a situation like what happened in Boulder, Colorado with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=36.1s)]
*  a visa overstay. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=39.900000000000006s)]
*  You have the fact that they spent so much time on climate change that they weren't dealing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=41.42s)]
*  with the things that people really care about, jobs. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=45.06s)]
*  And I would also add that the Democrats have continued to support the teachers unions while [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=47.42s)]
*  at the same time America's kids cannot read and write or do basic math. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=51.82s)]
*  And we are going into a situation where we're going to compete with China. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=56.9s)]
*  With what? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=60.14s)]
*  With the robots? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=61.14s)]
*  I mean, that is a little bit insane. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=62.14s)]
*  I do think that their big problem to me is that Tim Walz is their spokesperson. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=63.42s)]
*  First of all, nobody could name the head of the DNC. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=70.94s)]
*  Nobody could say who the head of the Democrats is. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=74.06s)]
*  Nobody is emerging yet. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=76.0s)]
*  And we are in June. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=77.14s)]
*  And I don't see anybody emerging because Harold Ford Jr. refuses to throw his hat in the ring. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=78.18s)]
*  He emerges every day at five o'clock. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  Harold, your name was invoked. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=85.54s)]
*  What would you like to say? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=87.02s)]
*  It is good to be back at the table. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=88.02s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=90.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=91.02s)]
*  I remind Democrats, as we think about this moment in the wilderness, and I tried to share [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=92.02s)]
*  a little bit of it yesterday, this happens after a presidential race. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=96.9s)]
*  The losing party or the losing group has to figure out what they do differently and better. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=100.74s)]
*  I'm old enough, mature enough to remember there was a time when I didn't think that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=105.7s)]
*  Democrats would get back to the White House. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  In the 80s, you had Reagan. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=112.42s)]
*  Late 80s, you had H.W. Bush to 92. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=114.58s)]
*  And all of a sudden, this governor from Arkansas appeared and captured the imagination of the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=116.94s)]
*  party. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=122.69999999999999s)]
*  We have to remember, he lost Iowa, lost New Hampshire. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't until Super Tuesday that basically the biggest group, the most reliable group [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=124.82s)]
*  of voters in the Democratic Party, black voters, gave him victories in big states across the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=129.1s)]
*  South and really rekindled his campaign. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  Republicans were out of control in the House of Representatives for 40 years, from 1952 [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=137.54s)]
*  to 1992, and 1994, excuse me. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=141.5s)]
*  And it took 40 years. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=144.82s)]
*  It took Newt Gingrich and the contract with America to revive Republican relevance. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=147.06s)]
*  And when it comes to that kind of politics, in 2008, people thought after Obama that Republicans [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=153.5s)]
*  couldn't get organized, that Republicans didn't have a bench. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=157.3s)]
*  Then your father-in-law came along and did something to the political system that upended [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=160.54s)]
*  it all. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=165.58s)]
*  And we're seeing it now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=167.06s)]
*  And working class, reliable Democratic voters are now voting for Republican. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=168.46s)]
*  I would argue President Trump almost supersedes the political party system. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=173.78s)]
*  He's a Republican, but he's bigger than that in many ways. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=177.34s)]
*  That's the future of politics. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=180.62s)]
*  He has ideas. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=182.74s)]
*  I don't agree with all of your father-in-law's ideas, but I got to tell you, he has a way [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=183.74s)]
*  about him where if he thinks it's going to work, he'll stick with it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=187.74s)]
*  If he doesn't, he's willing to change and to adapt to what the country wants. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=190.78s)]
*  We as Democrats have to understand that going back to the old ways won't work. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=196.06s)]
*  We talked on the show, tactics, spending money to figure out if we should do podcasts. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=201.18s)]
*  Let's get a purpose again. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=205.3s)]
*  Let's get a set of ideas again. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=207.06s)]
*  You said it well the other day. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=208.34s)]
*  Let's get a reason. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=209.7s)]
*  And then you can think about the tactics. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=210.7s)]
*  We are still smart on taxes and the economy and education. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=213.94s)]
*  We just got to be bolder. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=216.7s)]
*  And if we're not bold, we're going to be having this silly conversation for a much longer [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=218.22s)]
*  time than I want to. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  Lara, he brought up flexibility, and that's always good to have when you're a politician [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=224.42s)]
*  sometimes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  Why can't the Democrats be a little more flexible and listen to the voters and say, hey, maybe [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  we're going to pivot back a little to the center? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=234.62s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  And maybe Harold wants to opine on that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  But look, I think the problem they're having right now is that there are two different [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=239.54s)]
*  groups within the Democrat party. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  You have the people who want to be a little more reasonable, Harold, and then you have [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=247.66s)]
*  the very far left wing of the party that is very radical. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=250.98s)]
*  And I don't think most Americans can align with that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  And it turns out, I love to see the way they freak out over this new polling and over this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=256.5s)]
*  new information that Americans like what they see with Donald Trump. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  I think for the first time in 20 years, 50% of the country thinks we're on the right [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=264.38s)]
*  track, thinks that things are going well in America, and they believe in this president. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=269.46s)]
*  When you have gaslit people and lied to people like the Democrats did for really the past [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=273.78s)]
*  10 years with Donald Trump, but now you start to see the result. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=280.14s)]
*  You see that inflation is going down. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=283.5s)]
*  You see that we actually had a great result whenever it came to our trade deficit. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=285.26s)]
*  We almost slashed it in half between the months of March and April. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=291.3s)]
*  When things are moving in the right direction, Americans feel it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=295.74s)]
*  They can feel the restoration of this country. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=298.98s)]
*  They can feel the strength of this country. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=301.41999999999996s)]
*  They know the Republican party is the one in charge right now doing it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=303.46s)]
*  So I would advise, I would love to have a little counterbalance with some reasonable [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=307.06s)]
*  folks on the left because I think that's the best thing for this country. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=312.82s)]
*  We can all talk about things, but they're reasonable and they're not crazy anymore. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=316.14000000000004s)]
*  Greg, I know you like to really hash over these poll numbers. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=319.74s)]
*  Take us on a deep dive, what you're seeing on these polls. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=323.38s)]
*  Well first off, I want to say the tie is amazing and happy Pride Month. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=326.38s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=329.86s)]
*  Happy Pride Month America. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=330.86s)]
*  I'm glad you remembered. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=331.86s)]
*  I sent it to him a few weeks ago. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=332.86s)]
*  All right, so here's the problem. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=334.42s)]
*  This is different. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=336.7s)]
*  The damage is done. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=338.34s)]
*  The Democrats always thrived on hoaxes, assuming that by the time the big lie would be exposed, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=339.86s)]
*  whether it would be Russian collusion or the fine people hoax, they already got what they [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=347.06s)]
*  needed. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=350.46s)]
*  The emotional impact of the lie resonated. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=351.46s)]
*  The truth didn't matter. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=353.78s)]
*  It's based on that understanding that you know and working in the press office. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=355.02s)]
*  The big story always lands on the front page. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=360.3s)]
*  Two weeks later, the corrections on page B7. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=363.21999999999997s)]
*  That's how it worked. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=366.54s)]
*  The New York Times and the Washington Post still have their Pulitzers for the alleged [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=368.58000000000004s)]
*  Russian interference story, even though we know it's BS. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=373.06s)]
*  But then something happened, and this is why it's so different. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=376.74s)]
*  Tapper's book came out and he deflates this hoax, but it was a hoax that we already knew, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=379.98s)]
*  but his audience didn't. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  It was the first time that the correction didn't get buried in the back pages. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  Biden's infirmity is now more well known than Biden himself. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=392.94s)]
*  His name will never be separated from what happened. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=397.54s)]
*  So the interesting thing, even more interesting than that, if you can imagine, the book didn't [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=401.21999999999997s)]
*  sell. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=406.82s)]
*  That tells you everything. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=408.38s)]
*  His audience, Jake's audience, was just informed that they were stupid, that they were gullible, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=410.14s)]
*  that they just got taken. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=416.68s)]
*  Who wants to buy that book? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=418.42s)]
*  Who wants to be a part of that party that sold you that lie? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=421.86s)]
*  I don't think there's any way you can walk back from this hoax the way you could with [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=425.53999999999996s)]
*  others because it was played on your side and the reveal is so spectacular. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=429.09999999999997s)]
*  And the result is resentment, bitterness, disgust over the actions of a party who thought [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=434.5s)]
*  they could pull this off, assuming that the correction would be minor. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=438.58s)]
*  Instead, it is huge, perhaps the biggest political scandal in history. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=442.18s)]
*  Finally, in terms of politics in general, the brainwash has worn off. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=446.5s)]
*  Trump didn't just make the red hats. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=451.78s)]
*  He made the red pills. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=453.58s)]
*  People now realize that the Dems have no truth but just assigned opinions. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=455.82s)]
*  Think about all of these opinions, rich people bad, poor people good, Joe Biden fine, Trump, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=460.73999999999995s)]
*  Hitler, George Floyd a martyr, BLM heroic, men can be women. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=467.21999999999997s)]
*  These were assigned opinions. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=472.5s)]
*  They came from committee. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=473.78s)]
*  And once you're without these opinions, what's left? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=475.58s)]
*  There's no structure. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=478.06s)]
*  There's no unifying principle. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=479.06s)]
*  There's no leader. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=480.5s)]
*  That's what you're feeling. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=481.82s)]
*  Trump realizes already because he was outside of politics that for the past 40 years, all [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=483.5s)]
*  political opinions were assigned. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=487.9s)]
*  You could be a Democrat. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=490.38s)]
*  He was. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=491.86s)]
*  You could be a Republican. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=492.86s)]
*  He was. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=493.97999999999996s)]
*  He is. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  So love him or hate him. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=495.97999999999996s)]
*  He shattered this prism. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=496.97999999999996s)]
*  There's no going back for Republicans and for Trumpers. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=498.82s)]
*  Now it's the time for the Democrats to realize they've been suckered that everything that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=502.06s)]
*  they were told was assigned to them and not real. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=506.38s)]
*  Should we give Harold the red pill? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=509.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=510.5s)]
*  We'll just put it in your drink. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=511.5s)]
*  Tell him it's a Flintstones vitamin. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=512.5s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=513.5s)]
*  Chew it up. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=514.5s)]
*  It'll go down well. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=515.5s)]
*  Knock it back, Harold. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=516.5s)]
*  I like those blue clothes you took. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqE5l6a4c4U&t=517.5s)]
