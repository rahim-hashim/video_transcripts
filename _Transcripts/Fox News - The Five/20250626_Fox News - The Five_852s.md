# 'TREASONOUS': 'The Five' takes a look inside the bombshell leak
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0)
*  Well, there's a united front at the White House, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=0.0s)]
*  back hard on a leaked Pentagon report, an early low-confidence damage assessment that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=4.46s)]
*  claimed U.S. strikes only set Iran's nuclear program back by three months. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  Now, the Pentagon is showing this footage as part of its response of a previous test, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=14.5s)]
*  and Secretary Hegseth maintaining the strikes were devastating. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=19.86s)]
*  Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history, and it was [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=24.46s)]
*  a resounding success. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=30.72s)]
*  I can say here that the assessment is that we significantly damaged the nuclear program, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=31.94s)]
*  setting it back by years. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=36.8s)]
*  I repeat, years. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=38.14s)]
*  Those that understand, those that see, those that do proper assessments recognize that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  what the United States military did was historic. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  And Hegseth saving some of his ammo for the media that he accuses of undermining the military [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=49.42s)]
*  service members who flew the mission. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=54.36s)]
*  It's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump, because you want him [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=56.28s)]
*  not to be successful so bad, you have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=61.72s)]
*  You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=68.16s)]
*  Maybe the way the Trump administration has represented him isn't true. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=71.12s)]
*  So let's take half truths, spun information, leaked information, and then spin it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  As for plugging the leak, White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt says the FBI is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=82.58s)]
*  on the case, and she added this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=87.34s)]
*  It's illegal, and they should be held accountable for that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=90.14s)]
*  Leaked bits and pieces of an intel assessment to push a false narrative. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=93.42s)]
*  Someone who had their hands on this, and it was a very few people, a very few number of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=97.26s)]
*  people in our government who saw this report, that person was irresponsible with it, and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=102.18s)]
*  we need to get to the bottom of it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=107.94s)]
*  Trump warning of harsh consequences if that leaker is caught, he posted on Truth Social. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=110.18s)]
*  The Democrats are the ones who leaked the information on the perfect flight to the nuclear [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=115.54s)]
*  sites in Iran. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=119.34s)]
*  They should be prosecuted. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  All right, lots to get to. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=122.34s)]
*  I don't think, Jesse, that it's irresponsible of the media to say, well, what was the efficacy [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=124.98s)]
*  and the results of the strike? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=131.62s)]
*  But to go forward with the Defense Intelligence Agency low-confidence report as if it was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  gospel, and then it was like a wildfire all across the media does seem a little irresponsible. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=139.26s)]
*  It is, and we were so proud to hear from this general about this mission. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=145.7s)]
*  It makes you almost cry, almost cry. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=150.3s)]
*  But to hear that this guy's studied this mountain for 15 years and spoke to geologists and industry [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=154.42s)]
*  and explosive experts, and then 15 years later, they get the go-ahead and these pilots go [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=163.1s)]
*  in and it's a 37-hour flight, and they basically drop six bombs down this air shaft, swish, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=171.1s)]
*  swish, swish, swish, swish, from 15,000 feet. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=179.1s)]
*  The perfection and the precision, it's just incredible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=185.5s)]
*  And so it's obviously a successful hit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=189.22s)]
*  And the pilots even said it was, I think, the darkest night of the month, and they said [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=192.38s)]
*  all of a sudden it was like daytime. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=197.98s)]
*  It was the brightest and most ferocious explosion they've ever witnessed. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=199.86s)]
*  And they even practiced it on dummy mountains. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=205.08s)]
*  And so everyone's feeling this huge swelling of patriotism, and then CNN comes along and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=208.5s)]
*  sullies it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=213.54s)]
*  Now, CNN says we didn't do anything wrong. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=214.54s)]
*  But CNN spent 48 hours with guests at the top of every single hour saying the mission [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=216.18s)]
*  failed, saying the bombs didn't work, says the Iranians still have a nuclear program. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=223.06s)]
*  What kind of effect does that have? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=229.3s)]
*  You're basically taking classified information and using it to undermine the commander in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=230.38s)]
*  chief and cast doubt on the effectiveness of the American military capabilities and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=238.22s)]
*  putting the commander in chief at a disadvantage when he's trying to maintain a ceasefire. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  It's treasonous. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=249.5s)]
*  That's the T word, Jessica. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=250.74s)]
*  And Cash and Bongino are going to be looking at these congressmen now, because I have a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  suspect list. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=258.06s)]
*  I feel like I know who this person was. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=259.34s)]
*  And you can easily find them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=261.86s)]
*  There's a limited amount of people that access this intelligence. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=263.1s)]
*  You go and see who got access to it, and then you narrow it down, and then you get a warrant [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=266.18s)]
*  for their phone. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=269.9s)]
*  So they better lawyer up, because someone's going to go to prison for a very long time. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=270.9s)]
*  I really think that when you add up the Israelis, even the Iranians, the CIA, the DNI, the Pentagon, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=276.22s)]
*  they all say the same thing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=285.42s)]
*  They hit pay dirt. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=287.62s)]
*  The only one saying it wasn't a righteous shot was the Ayatollah and CNN. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=288.62s)]
*  And the only reason the Ayatollah is saying that is because he's bluffing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  If he's really saying it at all himself. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=298.82s)]
*  The Ayatollah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=300.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=301.66s)]
*  I think, Charlie, one of the things about this is that because America and Israel did [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  something remarkable and outstanding for the world, I believe, in terms of the peaceful [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=309.94s)]
*  nature of the future of the world, there is the possibility of a regional transformation. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=316.14000000000004s)]
*  You now know that because of this action, if Iran isn't on the threshold of a nuclear [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=320.54s)]
*  weapon, they're basically like, oh, man. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=326.22s)]
*  And so they don't have that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=329.56s)]
*  And now you have the possibility of expanding the Abraham Accords and a different Middle East. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=331.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=335.48s)]
*  And I think that President Trump will get the same credit from these people that he [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=336.48s)]
*  got for the Abraham Accords, which were certainly among the one or two most significant things [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=339.04s)]
*  to happen in terms of world peace in the Middle East over the past several decades. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=345.64s)]
*  A problem that is so intractable that every great statesman that's been produced in the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=351.24s)]
*  past half century has basically lost in their efforts to try to bring peace there. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=356.88s)]
*  And I'm hopeful. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=363.44s)]
*  I was kind of amused listening to everybody's talk about how the MAGA base was going to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=365.24s)]
*  split in two over this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=371.48s)]
*  I always kind of find it funny when people suddenly become experts on Trump voters. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=374.36s)]
*  They've been scornful of Trump voters forever, and then suddenly they're experts on it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=379.12s)]
*  I think that most Trump voters, they don't want to get into another war by any means. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=383.12s)]
*  But if you had an option to either silence or put Iran out of commission or at the very [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=387.64s)]
*  least take a nuclear weapon out of their hands, 90 percent of Trump voters would be like, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=395.04s)]
*  yeah, that seems like a step in the right direction. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=399.76s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=402.94s)]
*  If this does happen, you're talking about an expansion of the Abraham Accords, a building [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=403.94s)]
*  on the Abraham Accords that we could have only dreamed of a couple of years ago. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=408.96s)]
*  The people at CNN, these people, they're never going to give him credit for this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  And in fact, I think that it actually is part of what drives them so insanely crazy is that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=417.32s)]
*  they see him bringing this level, actual common sense, a non-ideological approach to these [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=424.0s)]
*  problems with fresh thinking. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=430.67999999999995s)]
*  And then he gets solutions and actually gets people talking to one another. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=432.88s)]
*  And I think it worsens the Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=437.04s)]
*  It's almost like it takes it to a whole new level of fevered pitch. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=441.08s)]
*  They just freak out. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=445.48s)]
*  And I'm sorry that these people are going to suffer so badly about this, but I would [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=447.92s)]
*  rather have a peaceful world and a peaceful Middle East. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=452.04s)]
*  And I was thinking about you today because part of the briefing this morning was a real [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=456.72s)]
*  chance to honor, thank, and celebrate the men and women who worked on this mission. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=460.84s)]
*  They've worked on it their entire lives. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=466.12s)]
*  They've practiced, as Jesse was saying, they've practiced this. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=467.72s)]
*  They knew the mission. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=469.92s)]
*  And also for the young people that were there under attack and Qatar at our base there. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=471.0s)]
*  Your closest, I think, to the military here, what do you think that meant for them or to them? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  An exceptional message of gratitude and honor that they so richly deserve. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=483.36s)]
*  And I think so much of these military operations, the success, the efficacy depends on this [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=488.12s)]
*  absolute, perfect, magical collaboration between hundreds of thousands of people in [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=494.72s)]
*  all different forms and positions and functions. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=500.88000000000005s)]
*  And when it's executed properly and it looks effortless, people think it's easy. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=503.48s)]
*  But the reality is that it takes generations of institutional knowledge and that patriotism [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=507.08000000000004s)]
*  and that skill set that we can only find here. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=512.32s)]
*  So I was deeply appreciative simply as an American to witness that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=514.4s)]
*  And I agree with you that it was a right moment to express that gratitude finally for these [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=518.24s)]
*  troops under this with this administration. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=522.84s)]
*  Part of the hypocrisy I find with the media in terms of the reliance on this outlier report [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=525.76s)]
*  is that it's the same members of the media that are saying, well, it's going to take some [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=532.96s)]
*  time for us to be sure. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=536.4s)]
*  So if that were true, why then did they pounce so immediately on the low confidence outlier [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=537.76s)]
*  leaked report, premature and uncollaborated to have that finding? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=544.12s)]
*  Right. And we understand, of course, that it's one of of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=549.4s)]
*  multiple what I think the worst part about their deceit is maybe not even just the deceit, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  but the fact that they can they fail to celebrate an American success and the choose your own [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=556.8s)]
*  adventure, the option that sees the expansion of the Abraham Accords potential, peace, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=561.68s)]
*  prosperity and total liberation. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=566.16s)]
*  And that somehow they cannot celebrate that because of who the commander in chief was. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=568.24s)]
*  And we know that it's political because we saw this under the prior administration. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=572.48s)]
*  Right. There was a complete reliance, rightly so, on the presidency of the intelligence [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=575.88s)]
*  community. But the media ran with that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=580.88s)]
*  They had no problem waiting for consensus and confirmed reporting. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=582.92s)]
*  Right. Remember that the Afghanistan withdrawal when we were told by this administration [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  that the Afghan government would be in effect and remain in power for a really long time. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=591.64s)]
*  Well, clearly that was dead wrong. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=596.68s)]
*  But the media had no problem furthering that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=598.16s)]
*  And the Chinese spy balloon, which was why Biden shot it down over the water. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  And of course, the 51 intelligence officials, former who signed that letter to the same [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=604.4s)]
*  Natasha Bertrand. So the whole point is we see here that only now with this particular [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=609.52s)]
*  commander in chief, do they choose to report and amplify the drivel that first comes out? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=614.12s)]
*  Well, a lot of that same media just occurs to me, Jessica. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=619.4s)]
*  They were the ones who had a hard time saying that Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal was a [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=621.88s)]
*  failure. Really? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=625.56s)]
*  I. Maybe it's just my lived experience, but I felt like everybody was talking about how [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=626.72s)]
*  terrible that was. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=633.0s)]
*  And we had reports right away that there were people within the administration who told [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=634.48s)]
*  them, we don't think that you can move this quickly. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  We know that this is the right end result, but this process will not work. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=641.16s)]
*  Folks who worked for him in the Pentagon. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=644.84s)]
*  So I don't know. That's just my view on it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=647.12s)]
*  I also don't know how many reporters there would be who got the opportunity to report [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  that early intelligence brief on what had happened and wouldn't have put it out there. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=655.04s)]
*  And then after it came from CNN, it was confirmed by other outlets. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=661.04s)]
*  Listen, Donald Trump hates the press. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=664.96s)]
*  It's his number one witch hunt or whatever. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=668.6800000000001s)]
*  And Secretary Hegset knows how to please his boss. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=671.64s)]
*  And that was a performance. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=675.4s)]
*  No, they hate the biased press. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=676.4s)]
*  No. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=677.0s)]
*  They don't hate the press. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=678.0s)]
*  But they decide who's biased on a daily basis. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=679.0s)]
*  He does it all the time. He goes, oh, you're not so bad today. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=681.04s)]
*  And then tomorrow he says, oh, wait, I hate you again. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=683.08s)]
*  So Secretary Hegset was, that's fine. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=685.64s)]
*  But it doesn't change the reality of it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=690.16s)]
*  That he the way that he speaks to them, the way that he discredits genuine questions. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=691.92s)]
*  And it happened today with Secretary Hegset and the questioning about, you know, what [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=697.56s)]
*  changed over the last three days, right? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=702.16s)]
*  That you are now willing to say this was total obliteration when you said the reports are [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=704.4s)]
*  going to come in over time. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=707.76s)]
*  And I know that it went well because we got the review from Trump, one of the greatest, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=709.28s)]
*  most professional and most confirming news conferences I've ever seen. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  The fake news should have everyone involved in this. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=716.8s)]
*  We should fire everyone involved in the witch hunt and apologize for our great warriors. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=720.64s)]
*  I haven't seen anyone minimizing the warriors, asking questions about where 400 pounds of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=725.08s)]
*  60 percent enriched uranium is, is not minimizing what these warriors did. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=731.5200000000001s)]
*  And we should note as well that people in the Intel community, they're warriors as well, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=736.76s)]
*  and they get diminished constantly. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=740.5200000000001s)]
*  Talks about the deep state, et cetera. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=742.44s)]
*  The European intel agencies are reporting that the uranium is intact. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=744.96s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=750.4000000000001s)]
*  Jessica, the Europeans, we were telling them Russia was going to invade Ukraine for a year [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  and they were like, no, I don't I don't see it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=757.2s)]
*  Listen, I think American and Israeli intelligence is much crisper. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=758.92s)]
*  Well, the senators were briefed today. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  Tom Cotton comes out and he said it was not part of the mission to destroy the uranium. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=765.24s)]
*  Well, why wouldn't it be if you thought that all the uranium was in Fordo? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't you want to totally obliterate? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=773.48s)]
*  To get the weapon. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=775.32s)]
*  OK, so is no one concerned that there's 900 pounds of uranium maybe in a truck driving [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=775.92s)]
*  around the mountains there? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=781.52s)]
*  He says he hasn't seen any intelligence that they took it out in trucks. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=782.88s)]
*  And the guest today on Martha said those trucks that they saw parked next to the mountain [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=786.48s)]
*  are not capable of bringing uranium out of there. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=790.96s)]
*  Well, Senator Chris Murphy, who was also in attendance, said that saw no evidence of this [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=793.64s)]
*  has pushed back the nuclear project any more than a few months. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=798.48s)]
*  So we'll let time will tell. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=803.52s)]
*  But I thought it was a very. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=805.68s)]
*  Line of acceptability for denigrating people between the intelligence figures and ICE agents. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=807.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=813.88s)]
*  Why is it acceptable to denigrate ICE agents, but it's not acceptable to denigrate [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=815.2s)]
*  the leakers in the intelligence community? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=820.7600000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=823.9200000000001s)]
*  First of all, I'm talking about the intelligence community writ large. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=824.6s)]
*  But if you're talking about an ICE agent who's masked and pulling someone out of a home depot. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=827.36s)]
*  No, I just say don't do it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=833.36s)]
*  I don't say I don't call them a bad person. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=835.28s)]
*  I know the following orders. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=837.72s)]
*  I've seen Tom Homan and Stephen Miller. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3MaXxs9E0&t=838.72s)]
