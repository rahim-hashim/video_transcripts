# ‘The Five’: Trump hosts big, beautiful cabinet meeting after series of wins
**Fox News - The Five:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw)
*  President Trump holding a big, beautiful cabinet meeting, and he had plenty to gloat about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=0.0s)]
*  Watch here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=4.2s)]
*  They gave us no credit during this last little, the great, big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=5.2s)]
*  I only use the word great. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Democrats didn't vote a little, not one positive vote, with all of the good things in there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  They went skedaddle. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=19.04s)]
*  You know the word skedaddle? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=20.04s)]
*  I mean skedaddle. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=21.04s)]
*  They dropped the bombs, and somebody said, skedaddle, let's get the hell out of here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=22.84s)]
*  What we've done in this country in the last six months, nobody has ever seen it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=28.0s)]
*  We're right now, riding the hottest country we are, and you can all be proud of it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=32.4s)]
*  And he's not just rearranging policy, he's rearranging the furniture too. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=38.68s)]
*  I mean, Marco's, I see this gorgeous clock, grandfather clock. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  I'd love to take that clock out and put it in the cabinet room. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  He said, no, are you serious? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=51.84s)]
*  I said, Marco, I have the right to do it, Marco. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  I love the frame of those pictures. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=57.31999999999999s)]
*  Look at those frames. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=58.8s)]
*  You know, I'm a frame person. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=59.8s)]
*  Then we got the drapes, and we got the whole thing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=61.72s)]
*  We got new drapes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Here, we put on, you know, these lamps have been very important, actually, whether people [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=64.88s)]
*  love them or not. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=72.36s)]
*  We got some beautiful medallions, and you see them, they were put up there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=73.36s)]
*  It makes the lamps look better. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=77.52s)]
*  So we have the flags throughout the office, and it's really become quite a beautiful place. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=79.08s)]
*  But back to the wins. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu surprising President Trump at dinner last night by revealing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=86.64s)]
*  he's nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=90.68s)]
*  I want to present to you, Mr. President, the letter I sent to the Nobel Prize Committee. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  It's nominating you for the Peace Prize, which is well deserved, and you should get it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=101.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=107.4s)]
*  This I didn't know. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=108.4s)]
*  So it was quite a day there, Jesse Waters. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=109.84s)]
*  What do you think of all that? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=112.92s)]
*  Is there anything else you want to add about Harold's comment? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=114.32s)]
*  Okay, yeah, I'll fact check. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=116.52s)]
*  Fact check. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  Okay, I'm sorry, Harold. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm not... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  If this is how we're going to start doing it, get ready. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Get ready, because I'm going to blast everybody at the table with your comments. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  I just want everyone to know that I was nominated to be this person, because I'm typically one. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  But Bill Mollusian was on top of things. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=132.2s)]
*  He said, Harold's 6% number is for convicted murderers only who have been deported, and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=134.16s)]
*  convictions have pending charges for everything, murder, sex, crimes, violent assaults, DUIs, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=140.76s)]
*  domestic violence, etc. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  I said, oh, poor Harold. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  And he said, he's great, but don't listen to the wrong people, Harold. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  Ha ha. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=152.64s)]
*  Anyway, that was it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=153.64s)]
*  I just want everybody to know we have set a precedent on the five for fact checking. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=155.12s)]
*  I'm going to do mine, too. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  You can be my guest, Harold. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  But just remember, Harold, that I was nominated to deliver the message. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay, back to the big, beautiful bill, the cabinet meeting, and all the things, Jesse. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=164.68s)]
*  Is that a cabinet meeting or HGTV? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=169.68s)]
*  A little bit of both, you know? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  Because I felt like I was reading... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=172.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=173.96s)]
*  I went away for two hours. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=174.96s)]
*  I came back. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=175.96s)]
*  It was still going. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=176.96s)]
*  I mean, I learned a lot, like architectural di-dressed, which I had a subscription to. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=177.96s)]
*  You guys know that that's what a medallion was? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=181.56s)]
*  The thing that attaches the light fixture to the ceiling is a medallion. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=183.96s)]
*  Next dinner party I host in my house, I'm going to point out the medallion in my dining [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=187.56s)]
*  room and just watch people bask in my big, beautiful brain. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=190.72s)]
*  Is that what we're calling it? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=196.5s)]
*  No. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  This cabinet meeting lasted longer than all of Biden's nine cabinet meetings combined. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=198.92s)]
*  And I do think that Donald Trump wants the Nobel Peace Prize more than the green jacket [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=206.28s)]
*  at the Masters. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=210.76s)]
*  He's almost like campaigning for it, like it's an Academy Award. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=212.76s)]
*  You know how actors and directors like campaign for that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  It's good to have goals. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  But he is bringing people together. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  When these countries fight, he comes in. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=224.0s)]
*  He's like, ah, break it up, break it up. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  And then he announces the truth on Truth Social. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=227.56s)]
*  And he wants everybody to get along. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=231.08s)]
*  And then we also want their minerals, because I think we got minerals out of the Congo deal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=233.16s)]
*  But the big white whale is Ukraine and Russia. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=237.6s)]
*  Now, the problem is, Trump has admitted that Putin's dragging them along. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  And now we're just still sending defensive weapons to the Ukrainians. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=245.24s)]
*  So we're back to square one. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=248.76s)]
*  All we got was the minerals. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=250.36s)]
*  So that is really the big ticket item there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=251.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=254.04s)]
*  Harold Ford Jr., let me give you the floor. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=255.04s)]
*  So I think we've gotten more than minerals out of the Ukraine-Russia thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=260.36s)]
*  We spent a trillion dollars a year roughly in the country on defense. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=261.36s)]
*  If you look at what President Trump, I think he's exaggerated the number. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=265.56s)]
*  But he says we've spent $250 billion over three years in Ukraine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=268.16s)]
*  That's $250 billion. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=272.24s)]
*  I'll round it up to $300 out of $3 trillion that we spent in defense. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=273.24s)]
*  And we've done three things. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  Number one, we have protected Ukrainians from, helped protect Ukrainians by them fighting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  themselves from Russia. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=282.3s)]
*  We've exposed Russia for not having the military that they say that they have. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=283.64s)]
*  And three, we got NATO now to spend 5% of their GDP on defense. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=287.56s)]
*  A lot has come out of this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=293.36s)]
*  And if we're able to strike a nuclear, excuse me, a rare earth minerals deal with Ukraine, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=294.68s)]
*  we're able to extract over the next 10, 20 years, $3 to $4 trillion of that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=300.68s)]
*  We reduce our reliance on China. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=305.32s)]
*  We strengthen our standing in Europe. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=307.84s)]
*  And we expose Russia and Putin for being- [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=310.0s)]
*  You're leaving one thing out. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=311.88s)]
*  You're leaving out the peace prize. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=313.12s)]
*  And so, but if he does this, Jesse, I will go over with you, because I know you're going [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  to go over if he gets the peace prize. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=320.2s)]
*  I'll be the first to clap for him in every which way. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=321.4s)]
*  You said it well. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=324.12s)]
*  The Israeli Hamas matter. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=325.12s)]
*  We need to figure out ways to get those hostages home and get it into it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=329.32s)]
*  But it's Ukraine and Russia that will win him. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  If he brings it into that, that will win him the peace prize. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=333.6s)]
*  You know what? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=335.76s)]
*  He will deserve it if he's able to do it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=336.76s)]
*  A lot of the cabinet meeting, Emily, was about the big, beautiful bill. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=337.76s)]
*  And now the follow through is the cabinet's job. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  The president needs to deal with all the things that have just been mentioned on foreign policy [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=343.44s)]
*  and be the quarterback of this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=347.32s)]
*  But now the cabinet can go out, take the show on the road, and try to rebrand the bill, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=348.92s)]
*  not with a different name, but just to make sure people understand what's in it for them [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  in their local media. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=357.24s)]
*  And that's what it seemed like today was. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=358.44s)]
*  It was talking about sort of short-term accomplishments, but also absolutely that investment of the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=360.36s)]
*  long-term resources and deliverables. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=365.16s)]
*  I mean, I thought there are a few points that I thought in my 100 pages that I thought were [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=368.64s)]
*  really salient. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=373.23999999999995s)]
*  So when Secretary Rawlins talked about meeting this morning at the USDA, she said with four [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=374.23999999999995s)]
*  cabinet officials and five governors, unprecedented. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=379.4s)]
*  And she said, because we recognize that farming and farmland is a matter of national security, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  not just protecting the farmers. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  And when the president was talking about Administrator Lee Zeldin, he said he's probably the most [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=389.4s)]
*  important guy in the room because he's helping us get all of these permits and all of these [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  deregulation. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=396.2s)]
*  And he talked about the massive amount that American taxpayers have been paying because [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=397.2s)]
*  they paid for the subsidies and then they paid for the high cost of electricity in the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=401.32s)]
*  subsidies. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=404.76s)]
*  That was Energy Secretary Chris Wright. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=405.76s)]
*  The list went on. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=407.08s)]
*  Special Envoy Steve Witkoff talking about getting back 10 life hostages and the remains of nine [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=408.8s)]
*  deceased potentially by the end of this week. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=414.4s)]
*  In addition to a CISPAC, it was like every minute history was being made and the American [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  people were being told exactly how their tax dollars were being spent and saved carrying [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=420.88s)]
*  out their mandate. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=426.56s)]
*  But my favorite part was when he called Chuck Schumer a Palestinian, the Palestinian senator. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=427.64s)]
*  That was great. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  The Democrats think that they're going to win on talking about tax cuts. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=432.4s)]
*  But I actually think the Republicans could flip that on them, Greg, and say, actually, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=435.84s)]
*  you voted against the tax cuts. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=439.64s)]
*  So you were for the largest tax increase in history. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=440.88s)]
*  That is a great point, Dana. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=443.0s)]
*  But that's not what I'm thinking about. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  What are you thinking about? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=446.08s)]
*  I was with Donald Trump on immigration, on peace in the Middle East. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=447.68s)]
*  I went with him on tariffs. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=451.64s)]
*  He lost me on the grandfather clock. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=454.0s)]
*  If it wasn't for game shows, giving them as prizes, we would not be dealing with grandfather [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=456.84s)]
*  clocks. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=465.4s)]
*  No one uses them to tell time. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  It just depresses rooms when you see a grandfather clock. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=470.24s)]
*  Have you ever walked into a hotel and there's a grandfather clock and you go, why are we [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=474.96s)]
*  here? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=479.76s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=481.64s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  And you can never really tell what time it is. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=483.4s)]
*  And by the way, so the Nobel Prize, you know, Israel nominates Trump. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think the severed head of Edie Amin has a better chance of getting it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=493.24s)]
*  Let's remember the Nobel the Nobel Committee was the original DEI. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=499.76s)]
*  They gave their prize to Obama because he was black. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=503.88s)]
*  He wasn't even president. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=506.6s)]
*  But I love what Trump is doing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=508.6s)]
*  He's staggering the wins. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=510.72s)]
*  Like people didn't see that coming with the terrorists, but it's like they're all coming [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=512.72s)]
*  in. So every other day he gets a win and it's a reminder that you have a president, you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=515.6s)]
*  know, unlike that, whatever that thing was in the White House. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=520.2s)]
*  What? The auto pen, the auto pen. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=523.16s)]
*  But we needed Biden's reign of error to as a halftime show to make us desperate for the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=525.0400000000001s)]
*  second half of Trump. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=532.6s)]
*  And again, when you look at this, there's a lot of stuff to make fun of in meetings like [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=534.2s)]
*  that, but it's because you can see that's the transparency versus the cover up. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=538.16s)]
*  You see the you see everything, the warts and all you can laugh about the about the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=543.4000000000001s)]
*  grandfather clock and him talking about the whatever the things here and there. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=548.0400000000001s)]
*  You can laugh about the Epstein stuff, but at least we see it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=551.72s)]
*  We couldn't see how the sausage was made with by Joe Biden because he was the sausage. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=556.12s)]
*  Greg, if Joe Biden had pointed to a grandfather clock, what would you have said on the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=562.12s)]
*  five if Joe Biden said, look at that grandfather clock, I like it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=565.4000000000001s)]
*  Look at the thing on the roof. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  You'd have laughed. I would have said. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=570.88s)]
*  Oh, I would. That's what I'm doing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=572.16s)]
*  No, just saying you're being consistent. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=573.9599999999999s)]
*  But see, Joe Biden would think that's a real grandfather. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=575.6s)]
*  Well, look at that wooden man. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=578.4s)]
*  Was that John Kerry? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=580.12s)]
*  What's Kerry doing in here? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=581.76s)]
*  Hunter Marko, please. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=584.8s)]
*  It does look like John Kerry. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=586.16s)]
*  All right. Coming up, the disastrous advice that Joe Biden's own advisors gave and how [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  it cost him the election. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=592.8399999999999s)]
*  Else. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqjF5C2MCdw&t=602.16s)]
