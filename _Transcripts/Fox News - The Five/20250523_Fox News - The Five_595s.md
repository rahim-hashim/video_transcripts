# ‘The Five’ on the ‘stink’ of Biden
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY)
*  Yeah, the Democrats sure wish we'd stop talking about all the devastating Joe Biden cover-up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=0.0s)]
*  headlines. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=5.04s)]
*  Well, too bad. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=6.04s)]
*  One of the Obama bros is now admitting that he soft-pedaled concerns about our geriatric [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=7.04s)]
*  former president, and here's why. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=10.8s)]
*  I remember feeling, I want to talk about this as a huge liability. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=13.76s)]
*  I want to talk about this as something Joe Biden can overcome, but I'm not going to go [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=18.92s)]
*  so far as to say, I think Joe Biden must drop out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=22.6s)]
*  He is too old to be president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=25.52s)]
*  A, because I didn't know exactly what was going on behind the scenes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=26.92s)]
*  But B, if Joe Biden is the candidate, I want him to win because I care about the country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  Well, you saw that liberal daily show host, Jon Stewart, he's warning his fellow Democrats [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  that anyone with the stench of Joe Biden on them is going to have a tough time scrubbing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=41.36s)]
*  it off. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=46.72s)]
*  It has sown the seeds for a real, and it's an opportunity for an interesting reinvention [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=48.48s)]
*  of what this Democratic Party can be. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  It's going to come from someone outside of it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  I think anybody that has any of that stink on them is not going to be particularly successful. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=63.86s)]
*  If that is not a Democrats slogan in 2028, something has gone terribly wrong. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=72.32s)]
*  Overcome the stink. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=78.89999999999999s)]
*  If I don't have that on a bumper sticker. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=79.96s)]
*  It's compelling. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=82.24s)]
*  Greg, what's with Democrats and presidents that just their health falls apart? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=83.24s)]
*  We got FDR, now you got Biden. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=88.56s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  You just named two. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=91.63999999999999s)]
*  See, I think you need a third one for a trend. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  Jimmy Carter passed away, so I'll help you there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  But yes, that's true. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  Yes, that is true. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=100.92s)]
*  But they're realizing that they need a Trump of their own, and they're right, because Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=101.92s)]
*  took on the establishment, not just the Democrats. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=107.12s)]
*  He took on everybody. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=109.64s)]
*  They need that because they need somebody to take on their party. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=111.14s)]
*  But they have to realize that it was their treatment of Trump specifically that got him [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  to this juncture. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=118.64s)]
*  Why did they tolerate, protect, and enable a decrepit president? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Because they convinced themselves that Trump was Orange Hitler, and that anything was better [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=126.22s)]
*  than Orange Hitler. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=131.78s)]
*  Leave nothing on the table. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=133.14s)]
*  Everything was on the table, including lying, creating a cover-up, because a corpse would [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=135.46s)]
*  be better. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=140.7s)]
*  A corpse would be better than Trump. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=141.86s)]
*  Scott Adams lays it out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=144.18s)]
*  I'm going to keep mentioning him every day. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=145.98s)]
*  The Biden is fine hoax was dependent on the Trump is Hitler hoax, which was resting on [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=148.44s)]
*  the fine people hoax. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=154.98s)]
*  And it was the fine people hoax. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  And this is the hilarious part that Biden ran on in 2020, his own words. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=158.06s)]
*  So how crazy is it that the lie that got him elected is now the lie that effectively destroyed [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=163.7s)]
*  the party? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=170.2s)]
*  This is why I brought up the fine people hoax every day, because this is where it ends. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  They do need a rebrand. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  They may have to change their name. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  Philip Morris became Altria. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=177.82s)]
*  That's a possibility. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=179.62s)]
*  Bruce Jenner became Caitlin. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=180.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=182.54s)]
*  This could happen. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=183.54s)]
*  We need a complete cleaning of the house. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=185.1s)]
*  The one thing I'll say and then I'll shut up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=186.1s)]
*  The corruption is so vast and so widespread, it might work to the Democrats' benefit, because [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=187.54s)]
*  like, where do you start? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=192.54s)]
*  I don't know where you start. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=194.94s)]
*  I know where James Comer is going to start, apparently, Jillian. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=195.94s)]
*  He's going to call in folks to be interviewed over what they knew, when they knew it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=198.42s)]
*  And he's positioning this as an investigation into potentially, I guess, defrauding the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=204.94s)]
*  American people. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to say he's going to do what he always does, which is open an investigation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=211.86s)]
*  And that is going to go forward. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=217.54000000000002s)]
*  Everybody's going to kill me for saying this, but to play devil's advocate, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying there was not a cover-up and I'm not saying that people should not be held [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=223.5s)]
*  responsible. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=230.18s)]
*  I have never worked in politics, but having worked in Washington, D.C. for a very long [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=231.18s)]
*  I will tell you that this is the job of aides, whether they're working for a member of Congress. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=235.34s)]
*  Greg's shaking his head in agreement with me. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=243.17999999999998s)]
*  No, I've said this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  It's not that the White House is supposed to lie. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=247.78s)]
*  It's the media. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=248.78s)]
*  If you are there... [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=249.78s)]
*  It's the media that's really it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=250.78s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=251.78s)]
*  Yeah, so there's accusations against the media for covering up and the officials. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=252.78s)]
*  In terms of the officials at the White House, they were hired by the Biden campaign and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=256.86s)]
*  then the Biden White House to protect the president's interest. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=261.38s)]
*  A big part of your job when you work in Washington, whether you work for a freshman member of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=264.62s)]
*  Congress or the commander in chief, is to hide some of the more unsavory aspects about [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=269.7s)]
*  them, whatever those are, hide their weaknesses, and insist that there's nothing going, no [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=277.5s)]
*  problems, everything is great. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=285.26s)]
*  So I think it's not that you don't then blame people for taking that way too far, but not [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=287.1s)]
*  everybody looks at it as this was something wrong. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=294.94s)]
*  A lot of people look at it as like the staff, at the staff level, they were just doing their [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=300.26000000000005s)]
*  jobs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=304.66s)]
*  But the media didn't do their job. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=305.66s)]
*  Not the media, yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=306.66s)]
*  So Jessica, like more of a 30,000 foot view here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=307.66s)]
*  If you wanted to draw something similar in a different way, you go back. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=310.54s)]
*  After George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, the Republican Party was not in a good place. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=314.94s)]
*  So you had this Tea Party movement that came after it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=319.86s)]
*  It did pretty well, kind of fizzled out under Obama. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=322.3s)]
*  And then from there you have what is now the MAGA movement that has taken over the Republican [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=325.06s)]
*  Party. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=328.42s)]
*  The Democrat Party, is Joe Biden the George Bush for them, the one that's going to cause [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=329.42s)]
*  a major reset, that's going to create a groundswell of something different? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=334.58s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=339.66s)]
*  No. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=341.06s)]
*  I still think that there are not that many policy variations that other Democrats would [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=342.06s)]
*  be putting forward. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=348.14s)]
*  I mean, you have the progressive wing and you have the more centrist wing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=349.14s)]
*  But generally speaking, Democrats were pretty happy with the legislative achievements of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  the Biden White House, which is why it was so hard for so many people to say that they [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=356.22s)]
*  thought he wasn't doing a good job or that he couldn't continue on to run again. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=360.1s)]
*  And so no, I don't think it's like the Tea Party movement. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=364.86s)]
*  And usually what happens when there is a challenge from the left is that they just lose to the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  centrist candidate. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=370.66s)]
*  I mean, that's why we don't have Cori Bush anymore. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=371.90000000000003s)]
*  That's why we don't have Jamal Bowman anymore. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=373.74s)]
*  There aren't really parallels between the two. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  But I think what's going to happen and I'm not saying Ilhan Omar is way worse than Michelle [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=378.14000000000004s)]
*  Bachman was. I mean, there's there's still plenty of them in there. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=382.18s)]
*  Yeah, there are definitely far left progressives in there. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=385.82000000000005s)]
*  But I'm just saying that anyway. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=388.54s)]
*  What twenty twenty eight is going to be about is what happens over the course of the next [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=392.94000000000005s)]
*  four years. That's what happens. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=397.02000000000004s)]
*  There's going to be a referendum on the Trump two point. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=398.26000000000005s)]
*  Oh, if JD Vance is top of the ticket, it'll be easier to tie it directly to him. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=401.26000000000005s)]
*  And right at this particular moment, Democrats aren't all that unhappy with what they're [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  seeing. You know, Trump announcing a tariff for a day, for instance, this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=408.94000000000005s)]
*  reconciliation bill, if it goes through and cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  Medicaid and Medicare to give tax breaks to the wealthy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=419.02000000000004s)]
*  Not true, but OK, it is 100 percent. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  You are spinning. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=423.82000000000005s)]
*  I'm not. You are so fast. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=425.06s)]
*  I'm getting under my eyes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=427.54s)]
*  I'm looking straight ahead. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=428.54s)]
*  Ask Josh Hawley and I will say and you said Josh, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=430.38s)]
*  tell him I love his op ed. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=435.06s)]
*  And Greg mentioned a staggering level of corruption. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=436.9s)]
*  And I just got a note that the staggering level of corruption from last night's [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=439.94s)]
*  meme coin dinner. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=444.3s)]
*  That's what you're focusing on. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=445.86s)]
*  The 40 percent. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=447.94s)]
*  No, 40 percent of Donald Trump's wealth has been accumulated since he became [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=449.22s)]
*  president because of two crypto coins. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=453.06s)]
*  The New York Times did interviews with foreign buyers of this cryptocurrency who [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=455.3s)]
*  came over here to have dinner with him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=459.5s)]
*  A guy from South Korea. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=461.22s)]
*  This is not even part of the segment. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=462.42s)]
*  So what you're talking about? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=464.94s)]
*  Do you call out? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=466.46000000000004s)]
*  Who is corrupt and who is profiting off the American office? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=468.5s)]
*  They try to cover that up. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=471.94s)]
*  I don't think so. Caroline Levitt said you're defending an administration that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=473.14000000000004s)]
*  covered up a dying leader and you're sitting here going, but meme coin, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=477.82000000000005s)]
*  meme coin. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=483.34000000000003s)]
*  All right. Let's give Paul a chance to clean it up real quick. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=485.5s)]
*  Paul, final thoughts. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=488.46000000000004s)]
*  It is clean on my side of the street. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=489.46000000000004s)]
*  All right. All I can say is this. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=491.66s)]
*  Right now, if the Democrats are really happy with all of their legislative [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=492.86s)]
*  initiatives and where they sit, then they were out to lunch. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=496.3s)]
*  5 November, 20 January and subsequent because they got shellacked. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=499.1s)]
*  There's that. OK, number two, let me just focus on investigations real quick [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=502.66s)]
*  because Comer is going to constitute. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=506.22s)]
*  I want this congressional investigation to be the backdrop of summer. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=508.02000000000004s)]
*  Let that be. You know, somewhere you get like baseball's on in the background. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=512.86s)]
*  I really pay attention. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=515.46s)]
*  These hearings should be something that's going on in the background. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=516.54s)]
*  Here's why. Donald Trump, thirty four, quote unquote felony convictions on that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=518.74s)]
*  B.S. case brought here in New York City based on the idea that it was election [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=523.14s)]
*  interference. Well, if paying Stormy Daniels is election interference to a [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=526.82s)]
*  beyond the reasonable doubt standard, then you're telling me hiding the fact [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=531.26s)]
*  that we had a president who was completely non-compassmentist. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=534.86s)]
*  That's not election interference. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=538.42s)]
*  I want to know who colluded on that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  And you know what? There's no getting out of it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=541.78s)]
*  If you're the media and his wife, you can take it from the guy himself. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=543.82s)]
*  He would come out at the press conference. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=547.66s)]
*  He'd look at the cards and he'd say, OK, let me see what I'm going to call on here. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=549.0600000000001s)]
*  So very clearly they were colluding. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=552.1800000000001s)]
*  Get people on the road. Get into the comms. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=554.26s)]
*  It's always a right. It's always the comms, as they say in Intel. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=556.14s)]
*  Get into those communications. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=559.26s)]
*  Find out who's talking to remember Donna Brazil gave you the questions [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=560.78s)]
*  to Hillary Clinton. Yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=563.98s)]
*  Find out if that kind of stuff went on. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=564.82s)]
*  Find out who was involved in you can even if it doesn't have to be arrests. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=566.54s)]
*  But put the sunlight on it because the entire media needs an enema. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=569.98s)]
*  So Donald Trump said he said to clean it up real good. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=573.02s)]
*  All right. Up next, the loser, Chicago mayor, with a seven percent approval [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=575.38s)]
*  rating is calling President Trump a monster. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI9ZFwfu0kY&t=579.22s)]
