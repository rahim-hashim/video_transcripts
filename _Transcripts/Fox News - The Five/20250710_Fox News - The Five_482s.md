*  woman look I hate to tell the Dems you can't just assume that you can take us [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=14.48s)]
*  back because that assumes that you can change your opinion of us you know all [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=19.68s)]
*  of a sudden you're gonna reject all the misandry and the trans hysteria and all [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=24.68s)]
*  those narratives that not only made fun of male values but objectively normal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  values you want men and women to be okay with women and women showering with men [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=34.16s)]
*  in locker rooms or drag queens reading to kids at libraries how do you change [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=39.0s)]
*  that if that's who you are I mean if you don't like men how can you suddenly [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=43.68s)]
*  decide not to like them I tried that with Jodie Foster I think I think you're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=49.64s)]
*  asking too much of yourself because the moment you say hey guys come back and we [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=55.36s)]
*  do within ten minutes we're gonna say something that violates your strict [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=61.12s)]
*  code of intolerant tolerance or break wind it's ingrained in you to police [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=65.68s)]
*  thought and speech you can't go from that to live and let live and the funny [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=72.12s)]
*  thing about it is their definition of tolerance is the opposite of live and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=76.8s)]
*  let live you know it's I compel you to accept my lifestyle publicly all guys [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=82.04s)]
*  almost all guys are the same we want to be left alone especially right-wing dudes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=88.76s)]
*  you think a farmer in Idaho gives two F's about your pronoun we're not even [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=93.72s)]
*  gonna bother you about it just don't bother us that's I just don't think you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=98.12s)]
*  can change I don't think liberals can actually suddenly take off this costume [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  of misandry and go hey come back how is that possible what will they have to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  do to win back men if they can't fundamentally change I think this is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=111.96s)]
*  something that's been building for a long time it didn't just happen in the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=118.36s)]
*  last four years so if you remember during the Obama administration we had [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=121.0s)]
*  the life of Julia to remember this yeah this was the government policy was like [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  a whole outlook that they talked about Julia and how Julia will be taken care [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=128.84s)]
*  of by the government from when she was born all the way up until she was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=133.64s)]
*  retired and beyond and they didn't there was no life of Jack there was no [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=137.52s)]
*  life of Jack and Julia it was just the life of Julia and the focus on women has [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  been to the exclusion of men and this even maybe even goes back further [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  especially when it came to even when I was growing up in the 70s 80s where I [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=151.56s)]
*  remember my dad bought me this t-shirt it was yellow and it had black all caps [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  it said anything boys can do girls can do better I know that's not true but [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=163.92s)]
*  there was a time when there was a push to help girls have more confidence that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=168.92s)]
*  has helped in a lot of ways but it was to the exclusion of boys I remember Laura [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=173.04s)]
*  Bush when she was first lady early on she was like we have to as a country [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  start focusing more on boys in K through 12 education and so it was building for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=181.04s)]
*  a long time the Democrats were gonna have to deal with this there was never a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  cost to them turning on men until suddenly there was so I don't know what [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=189.68s)]
*  they're going to do at the to me if you look at Zoran Mamdani he's basically [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=194.4s)]
*  promising the moon and the stars for free to everybody I mean I don't know [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=198.68s)]
*  who's going to buy that there will be some men that do but if that's the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=203.24s)]
*  direction that the Democratic Party is going because Hakeem Jeffries can't seem [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  to say anything else then they might be in the wilderness for quite a while [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=209.88s)]
*  Emily does it have to be about pushing men down or bringing women up can't we [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=213.52s)]
*  just be together we work better together men and women don't we come on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=219.44s)]
*  man this is live TV you can't hit on her now [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=225.56s)]
*  well I think that the argument like that's that's what Trump did right he [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=231.24s)]
*  just saw when he just respected women he respects women so much no one cherishes [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=235.28s)]
*  women more than Trump that's what seats here we go all right so here's the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=241.4s)]
*  thing so in this in this whole article and like assessment they supposedly talked [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  to all these experts about what went wrong and how they ignored these the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  guys right and they called it a blind spot they said what a massive voter [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  blind spot but it wasn't a blind spot they excommunicated them they said we [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=259.92s)]
*  ignored them this time on you didn't ignore them you rejected and expelled and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  vilified men they created an epidemic of eunuchs and a world where Dylan Mulvaney [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=269.56s)]
*  was the face of Budweiser and Leah Thomas was nominated by you pen to be [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=276.56s)]
*  the NCAA woman of the year they literally recreated her land and here's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  the thing the left saw just simple masculinity as toxic obviously and hyper [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=286.2s)]
*  all of this analysis whenever they refer to masculinity they say hyper [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  masculinity and the whole point is that Trump and the GOP just just respected [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  masculinity just respected women and actually went to protect biological [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=300.96s)]
*  women so that the whole thing is everything on the left sees everything [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  is so magnified you know an American flag oh you must be a redneck terrible [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=308.44s)]
*  violent person oh you you like to be masculine you must be terrible instead [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=314.04s)]
*  of just respecting a normal person Donald Trump famously said Harold he's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=318.56s)]
*  gonna protect women whether they like it or not isn't that the message that women [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  need to hear I think I think James Carville says things in ways that really [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=328.04s)]
*  not only get people's attention but really makes you think Democrats forgot [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=334.16s)]
*  in many ways in 2024 and I agree with Dana it's been building for some time [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=339.72s)]
*  that every voter wants to be lifted up men in many ways were these swing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=344.12s)]
*  voters in this election his team President Trump's team looked at the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  data and said that we had we lost men from 16 to 20 we got to grow that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  number so they did what the other campaign didn't do they respected them [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  men they lifted men up I don't agree I don't necessarily agree that we can't [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=361.56s)]
*  get them back I never thought I would see a presidential election where the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=366.08s)]
*  Cheney's endorsed the Democrat and the Kennedy a prominent Kennedy would [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  endorse a Republican and then work in his administration and then we elect the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=372.88s)]
*  president who's a Republican who's pro-tariff pro-union and pro-entitlement [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=376.32s)]
*  spending so things can change in politics but I'd say to Democrats who [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=381.2s)]
*  remember this as you think about this women who are Democrats they bear [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=384.88s)]
*  children and they raise little boys to be young men so when we attack men women [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=388.52s)]
*  who have children who have little boys like my wife and many others they [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=395.44s)]
*  understand what it means to raise a little boy and they want their little [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  they want their young men and the men in their families to be respected and not [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=402.35999999999996s)]
*  to be belittled that doesn't mean they want them coddled but they don't want [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  them disrespected and that's what we did I am saying I want to be a firm [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=409.84s)]
*  at the same time dads want their girls to not have to compete against men in [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=415.52s)]
*  sports no doubt about it I'm just saying that like if you add all of the stuff up [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  it was like where else were they supposed to go but I got to disagree [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=423.96s)]
*  with you Harold I don't men don't want to be lifted up we want to be left alone [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=426.64s)]
*  we don't want to be pandered to I don't think the pan I think the Dems look at [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=430.36s)]
*  everything as groups and then they pander to them that's two different [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=434.36s)]
*  points I don't disagree with you now we do we do play too much identity politics [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=437.76s)]
*  but men certainly don't want to be belittled yeah men want men want like [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=441.0s)]
*  women want good jobs but women want men want their their boys and their girls to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=445.0s)]
*  be raised in safe communities and safe house I mean I agree with I think those [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=449.76s)]
*  are two different points yeah we don't all men want to be left alone Greg I [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=452.92s)]
*  mean to be given attention once in a while she's right there Jessie look at [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjbVBK3nrI8&t=457.12s)]
