# ‘The Five’: Why are Dems going ‘dark woke’?
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc)
*  Gavin Newsom just threw his own party under the bus in a brand new interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=0.0s)]
*  The California governor took a swipe at the Democrats saying, quote, I don't know what [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=5.32s)]
*  the party is. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=9.58s)]
*  I'm still struggling with that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=10.66s)]
*  That criticism comes as the party tries to rebrand themselves as dark woke. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=13.24s)]
*  The New York Times chronicling the rise of Democrats who think a new provocative, edgy [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=18.86s)]
*  attitude will help them defeat Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=23.64s)]
*  The ongoing dark woke is all the rage among Democrats who are desperate for authenticity. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=26.96s)]
*  This is what kicking the s*** out of fascism looks like. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=34.0s)]
*  I think I could... [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=38.56s)]
*  I think I could kick most of their s***. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=39.56s)]
*  I do think that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=40.56s)]
*  Somebody slap me and wake me the f*** up because I'm ready to get on with it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=41.56s)]
*  Total bulls***. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=45.44s)]
*  Absolute bulls***. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=47.84s)]
*  Beep, bitch. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=48.84s)]
*  Once you get successful, don't be a greedy bastard and not pay your taxes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=49.84s)]
*  If you could speak directly to Elon Musk, what would you say? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=54.8s)]
*  F*** off. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=57.64s)]
*  And here's more dark woke nonsense. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  Seinfeld creator Larry David is trashing Bill Maher for visiting Trump at the White House [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=61.72s)]
*  after writing an op-ed in the New York Times called My Dinner with Adolf. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=67.44s)]
*  And the climate doomsayer Al Gore comparing the Trump administration with Nazi Germany. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=72.88s)]
*  I understand very well why it is wrong to compare Adolf Hitler's Third Reich to any [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=79.6s)]
*  other movement. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=84.36s)]
*  It was uniquely evil, full stop. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=85.88s)]
*  I get it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  But there are important lessons from the history of that emergent evil. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  The Trump administration is insisting on trying to create their own preferred version of reality. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=93.08s)]
*  Okay, Jesse. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=100.6s)]
*  The New York Times says that dark woke is the way for the Dems to get their groove back. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=103.24s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, they said that about Dark Brandon. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  And he didn't get his groove back. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  So I talked to a Democrat the other day, did it by accident. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  I try to avoid these people, Judge. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=117.88s)]
*  But he told me how things used to go with Pelosi. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=119.63999999999999s)]
*  When she ran the thing, she would get her caucus together and get out a calendar. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  Say okay, Friday the jobs numbers are coming out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=128.04s)]
*  On Tuesday you're going to have a Pentagon hearing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=130.64s)]
*  On Thursday, NATO summit. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=132.76s)]
*  In the next week, whatever. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=134.32s)]
*  And she'd line up her best speakers for each of those issues and she'd put them out on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=137.2s)]
*  television and put them out on press conferences. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  And then everybody would get the same messaging. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=144.0s)]
*  And they'd have the messaging for offense and then they had it for defense. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=146.54s)]
*  And then they'd have a legal strategy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=150.16s)]
*  And then she broke her hip and the coup backfired and she was collateral damage. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  So Hakeem is running the show. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  And no one fears Hakeem. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=158.38s)]
*  Now Nancy, if you crossed her, she'd probably launch an ethics investigation against you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=160.36s)]
*  or strip you from your committee seat or something like that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=164.28s)]
*  But Hakeem doesn't have any clout. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=167.36s)]
*  So now everybody goes wherever they want at the same time and it's chaos. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=169.62s)]
*  And he's afraid of the base. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=174.38000000000002s)]
*  The base isn't afraid of them. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  That's why you're seeing people be rambunctious to get attention. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=178.02s)]
*  And they're all the ones going to El Salvador, ones fighting with Federman. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=182.08s)]
*  That's what you're seeing right now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  So until they have someone that can run the ship like a captain, you're going to see more [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=187.6s)]
*  of this trash. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=191.48s)]
*  You know, that's such a good point, Dana. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=192.48s)]
*  And the idea that, you know, the New York Times is saying that we need someone crass [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=194.12s)]
*  but discerning, rude, but only to a point. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=198.68s)]
*  I mean, they're defining Jasmine Crockett. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=201.84s)]
*  So nobody does marketing, they're marketing better than Democrats. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  How many times do they go to the well and pay consultants a gazillion dollars to come [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=209.82s)]
*  up with something that is so dumb? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=214.48s)]
*  And then the New York Times will write about it because they love process stories. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  Oh, look, they're really getting their act together. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  How is Darkwoke any different from before? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=222.2s)]
*  It's a little bit more crude, it's a little bit more crass, but it's still the same result. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  They always do like all the easy stuff that they think is going to get them where they [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  need to be, mostly because the media had helped them for a long time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  But that ship has sailed and I don't know who it's going to be. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=237.06s)]
*  Maybe it is Gavin Newsom that's figured out and said, I know how to break out and be somebody [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  who was outside of Washington who was saying, this party has changed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=244.16s)]
*  Let me be the one that comes in and solves everything and tries to cobble this back together. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=247.44s)]
*  I know that at some point the Democrats will get their act together. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=252.76s)]
*  I just find it really hard to imagine what that looks like right now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=255.88s)]
*  I can't imagine it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=259.32s)]
*  But Newsom's saying, I don't know what the Democratic Party is. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=260.32s)]
*  But it seems like this is trying to take a page out of the Donald Trump playbook clearly. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=264.28s)]
*  And we've seen them try this before and it hasn't worked for them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=268.08s)]
*  The New York Times piece references this new form of combative rhetoric. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  They said they want to win back the voters who have responded to Trump's no holds barred [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  version of politics. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=280.0s)]
*  So they want to go after dark woke. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=281.88s)]
*  They say they've been locked in a respectability prison. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=285.06s)]
*  They want to grab voters' attention. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=288.0s)]
*  I think the only thing you can take away from this is that they're not taking a page out [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  of Trump's playbook. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=293.32s)]
*  He focused on the issues. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=294.78s)]
*  He spoke to voters directly. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=296.18s)]
*  He addressed their concerns with policy pitches. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=297.84s)]
*  And they're still focused on the messaging. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=300.26s)]
*  And what is that messaging, Greg? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=303.02s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=305.18s)]
*  They have no messaging. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=306.18s)]
*  First of all, you got Al Gore and Larry David comparing the Trump administration to Hitler. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=307.18s)]
*  They haven't been arrested for that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=313.08s)]
*  So that doesn't help their argument, does it? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=315.38s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=317.4s)]
*  The comparison still happens despite millions voting for this Hitlerian person. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=319.58s)]
*  And I'm counting among his supporters Jewish leaders and philanthropists. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=325.5s)]
*  RFK Jr. and his wife Cheryl, who was in curb your enthusiasm. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=329.9s)]
*  Those are all apparently Nazi collaborators. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=334.7s)]
*  It won't matter because to these lazy minds, calling somebody Hitler isn't a big deal to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=337.62s)]
*  them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=344.9s)]
*  They've reduced the smear to just people that they don't like. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=345.9s)]
*  It's no longer a mass murderer. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=348.14s)]
*  So who knew liberals would be the one who gives Hitler a makeover? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=350.28s)]
*  Now he's just some guy you don't get along with. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=354.5s)]
*  Oh, he's like Hitler. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=356.54s)]
*  I don't get along with him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=357.54s)]
*  Oh, I get it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=358.54s)]
*  Dark woke sounds like a new like a new coffee brand at the Starbucks menu. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=359.54s)]
*  It's like I'll have a dark woke Colombian. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=364.66s)]
*  But they're not doing I think I think what Gavin's doing in the parties and doing is [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=368.16s)]
*  the heavy lifting. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=372.66s)]
*  We've talked about the fact that they don't have any ideas. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=374.3s)]
*  And we point this out. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=376.66s)]
*  And the reason is because underneath, whatever is generating their ideas is an ideology that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=377.74s)]
*  prevents you from thinking outside your failed ideas and thinking of new ones. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=382.98s)]
*  Of course, that's identity politics. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  It creates a tiny confined space. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=390.26s)]
*  And it tells you that the outside world is contaminated. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=392.62s)]
*  It's a reason why a new idea can't get out of bed because it's strapped to a gurney [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=396.14000000000004s)]
*  with a fat woke lady sitting on its chest. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  Imagine like you're going to a beautiful party and you want to go it looks great. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  It's wonderful. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=407.70000000000005s)]
*  But you're with a friend who says you don't want to go in there. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=408.70000000000005s)]
*  You're going to hate it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=410.8s)]
*  It's going to suck. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=412.06s)]
*  That friend is no friend. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=413.46s)]
*  That's identity politics. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=415.22s)]
*  And that beautiful party is life. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=416.46s)]
*  You become a boy in a plastic bubble, allergic to real human connection because you're not [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=418.22s)]
*  supposed to connect with those people because they're the oppressor. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=422.26s)]
*  So behind this adherence to identity politics is ultimately a fear of this, that your entire [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=425.54s)]
*  mindset has been a waste. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=431.22s)]
*  The sunk cost fallacy that I bring up a lot. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=434.18s)]
*  A sunk cost of a bad relationship is not a reason to stay in a bad relationship. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=437.14s)]
*  It's why wokeism like a drug or like a violent spouse will say if you ever leave me, you'll [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=442.97999999999996s)]
*  die. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=449.53999999999996s)]
*  It's why when people leave the left, the left turns on them just like an angry spouse. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  Up next, Dana's got a new advice book and we're all in it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktGhxGKlWc&t=457.06s)]
