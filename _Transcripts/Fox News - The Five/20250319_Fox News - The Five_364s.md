# 'The Five': Democrats root for Tesla's demise
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M)
*  Musk knows exactly why he's become the Democrats' public enemy number one. Listen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=0.0s)]
*  And they basically want to kill me because I'm stopping their fraud and they want to hurt Tesla [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=5.36s)]
*  because we're stopping this terrible waste and corruption in the government. And, well, I guess [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=11.68s)]
*  they're bad people. Bad people will do bad things. If we were succeeding in getting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  corruption and waste, they wouldn't care. But we are succeeding. Really, we're just implementing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=26.08s)]
*  the will of the people. And President Trump's praising his tech support for a job well done [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=33.04s)]
*  on the SpaceX rescue. Elon's able to do that with his genius and you have people that hate it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  And I really believe these are people that hate our country. It's a big problem. But, you know, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  there aren't so many of them. There are many more that love our country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=52.08s)]
*  This, Andrew, is last week the Democrats were blasting Trump for the stock market going down [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  and now they're on stage rooting for the stock market to go down. That was a very uncomfortable [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=62.0s)]
*  moment for an American governor to be rooting down an American company headquartered in Austin, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=66.88s)]
*  Texas. I mean, those employees count on that stock for their bonuses, for their pay. It's a large [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=72.08s)]
*  part of the compensation. The way they attract and retain top talent at the company. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=76.4s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, as you know, we often get the White House press briefing as you watch our show [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=81.44000000000001s)]
*  every day, Greg. America reports and Caroline Levitt briefed today. And she was asked about this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  She was asked about Governor Walz's words and she said, I think it's pretty sad. She said, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=91.04s)]
*  unfortunately, Walz is living a sad existence after his defeat in November. So she had sort of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=95.44s)]
*  a drop the mic moment. But I think this is a case where Democrats can probably learn that rooting on [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=101.68s)]
*  the demise of an American company does not fall into the category of turning their party around. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=107.68s)]
*  They should take note of that and perhaps, you know, continue to revamp the party. I say that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  as Jessica staring me down. Jessica, were you staring her down? Absolutely not. I would never [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  do that to Sandra. Do you want me to say more? Not really, but go ahead. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  You guys know, I think Elon Musk has done a tremendous amount of good. I think Starlink is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=127.2s)]
*  one of the more exciting modern discoveries or creations that there is. I again reiterate, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=135.52s)]
*  I draw the line at arson. No one should be setting cars on fire. But I would argue, no, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=141.76s)]
*  this is an important point. It's a free market point. But also, we talked about Dylan Mulvaney, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=148.72s)]
*  a single trans influencer who was on a single can of beer for months. And that can of beer set the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=154.4s)]
*  conservative movement on proverbial fire, rooting against at least half an American company, the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  Anheuser-Busch side of things. Kid Rock out there doing target practice with Budweiser cans, people [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=168.24s)]
*  vowing to decimate that brand. And Dylan Mulvaney has much less of an impact on people's lives than [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk does. So is that OK? Or that was wrong too, and everyone wants to may have culpa over [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  that. It was one can of beer with one transgender person on it. No one was intimidated not to buy [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=186.4s)]
*  Bud Light. Really? Then why did it drop? Why did they lose market value? Because it wasn't Dylan [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=192.0s)]
*  Mulvaney. It was the marketing person who denigrated the people who drank the beer. Really, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=197.68s)]
*  Dylan Mulvaney didn't get denigrated? Oh, yeah, she did. He did. I correct myself. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=203.12s)]
*  No, but I'm sorry. Go ahead. That's basically it. Also on the Musk wasn't allowed to get [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=211.36s)]
*  the astronauts down. The timeline doesn't add up. This NASA administrator from last summer, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=218.24s)]
*  Bill Nelson, said there was no discussion of that whatsoever, didn't know about the offer. And NASA [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=222.4s)]
*  officials have said that late February was the earliest that the crew could return without [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  interrupting other scheduled missions. OK, so they were just hanging out in space for nine months. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=230.56s)]
*  If you read articles about it. Oh, if I read articles about it? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=236.0s)]
*  Well, what else am I supposed to do? I didn't call them up. OK, OK, so they weren't stranded. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=239.76s)]
*  They were just hanging out. Spending a great time up in space. OK. You know, it was one thing to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=243.92s)]
*  shoot a can of beer and another thing to throw a Molotov cocktail at a $50,000 car. Yeah, last time [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=248.0s)]
*  I checked, there weren't conservatives setting Budweiser factories on fire. There were not crazed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=253.6s)]
*  conservatives keying Budweiser vehicles or trucks around the country. That wasn't happening. But [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=260.24s)]
*  look at this. I mean, Elon Musk rescues two astronauts who are up there for 286 days. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=266.32s)]
*  And this is how he's thanked. We'll light your businesses on fire. And the absolute absurd [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=272.0s)]
*  behavior of the left. He triggers liberals so much. I mean, to watch Tim Walz there talk about [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=277.6s)]
*  the joy in his day of the stock app. Like I pulled up the stock app on my phone. I'm not Nancy Pelosi. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=284.16s)]
*  I don't follow it minute by minute. So it says welcome to stocks on my phone on his phone. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=288.96s)]
*  He's tracking Elon Musk. He's excited when it drops to 225. Well, sorry, Tim Walz. You're having [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  a bad day. It's now at 235. And it's not just him. Mark Kelly, the supposed moderate, the guy who's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=298.96s)]
*  such a moderating voice in the Democratic Party. Every time I get in the car over the last 60 days, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=304.32s)]
*  it reminds me of the damage from Trump and Musk. Who gets in their vehicle? And for 60 days, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=310.56s)]
*  the thing on their mind is how much they despise a politician. This is entirely abnormal behavior. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=316.4s)]
*  Musk called Mark Kelly an American hero a traitor. When you've gotten in your car, I know you don't [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  drive. You're in Manhattan. But I do drive. OK, so every time you got in your car for 60 days, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=328.0s)]
*  have you thought about how much you hate Donald Trump? I mean, that is bizarre behavior. I mostly [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=332.0s)]
*  think about Moana because that's all that we listen to. Well, I love Moana too. But I would [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=335.2s)]
*  just say this. Libs of TikTok said you have a choice. You could be on team innovation or team [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=339.28s)]
*  destruction. Team innovation rescues people from space and creates billion dollar companies. Team [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=344.48s)]
*  destruction burns down said factories. I will take team innovation any day. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6KEKT6D7M&t=350.40000000000003s)]
