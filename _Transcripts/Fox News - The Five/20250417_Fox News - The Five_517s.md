# DAMAGING CREDIBILITY: 'The Five' dissects Democrats 'doubling down' on opposing deportation
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc)
*  Now this President Trump justifying his hardline deportation crackdown as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=0.0s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers like Senator Chris Van Hollen scrambled to El Salvador [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=4.0s)]
*  to rally behind Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=9.0s)]
*  The alleged MS-13 gang member who, as it's now been revealed, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=12.0s)]
*  also faced domestic abuse allegations. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=15.0s)]
*  Here's what the President said. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=17.0s)]
*  They're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=20.0s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person, and they're on the loose. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=24.0s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=29.0s)]
*  or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=33.0s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=36.0s)]
*  One anonymous House Democrat is not happy with how his party is focused on [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=41.0s)]
*  fighting deportations, telling Axios that Trump is, quote, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=45.0s)]
*  setting a trap for the Democrats, and we're falling for it like usual. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=48.0s)]
*  And right on cue, it looks like these folks are falling for it too. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=53.0s)]
*  Democrats should have someone on the ground in El Salvador every day [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=58.0s)]
*  until Kilmar Abrego Garcia is sent home. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=62.0s)]
*  If you're not speaking up for this man, there will be no one left to speak up for you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=67.0s)]
*  If they can disappear Mr. Abrego Garcia, then they can disappear you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=71.0s)]
*  They can do this to Abrego. They could do this to any immigrant. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=77.0s)]
*  What is stopping them from deporting me into this El Salvador prison? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=80.0s)]
*  This is simply about letting him have his day in court. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=84.0s)]
*  Greg, the strategy of ready fire aim strikes the Democrats again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=88.0s)]
*  Yes. How do you think Van Hollen felt sitting on the plane heading to El Salvador [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=94.0s)]
*  as the news comes out about this Father of the Year? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=100.0s)]
*  It's like, wait, this illegal immigrant has a history of violence, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=103.0s)]
*  attacked his wife one or two times. Is it too late to turn around? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=107.0s)]
*  Can we do an emergency? I have a medical emergency. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=113.0s)]
*  He should have faked a medical emergency and landed in Miami. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=116.0s)]
*  Usually constituents fall for this BS from politicians. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=119.0s)]
*  It's rare to see a politician fall for their own BS. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=124.0s)]
*  Don't hit your own stash. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=128.0s)]
*  By the way, is it true Cory Booker is going? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=130.0s)]
*  As I understand it, that trip is still on. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=134.0s)]
*  My theory is because it's a captive audience. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=137.0s)]
*  He's going to a prison. They can't leave when he starts yapping. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=139.0s)]
*  After 10 minutes, they're going to be begging for the lethal injection. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=143.0s)]
*  The Democrats keep egging each other on to participate in actions [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=147.0s)]
*  that only damage their credibility and their careers and their future. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=151.0s)]
*  Remember, it's the Dems who told people to take to the streets, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=155.0s)]
*  get in their faces, bring the fight to the people, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=158.0s)]
*  while also telling them that their enemy is a Nazi or a Hitler. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=163.0s)]
*  Van Hollen took the bait. Now I think he's a dead fish. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=168.0s)]
*  Who can take him seriously after this? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=171.0s)]
*  You're chasing a wife beater. It's a climax of love actually. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=174.0s)]
*  This Maryland dad is yet another daily special that they serve up to the gullible, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=178.0s)]
*  who are incapable of telling truth from fiction. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=184.0s)]
*  This situation will stick with them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=188.0s)]
*  Think about people who aren't a politician. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=191.0s)]
*  Do you think anybody is going to hire a Colombian student [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=194.0s)]
*  who tore down posters of hostages? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=197.0s)]
*  So they were fed a lot of propaganda and they're going to pay for it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=199.0s)]
*  People vandalizing cars. People are going to hire that guy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=202.0s)]
*  They're going to know his name. He was filmed. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=205.0s)]
*  And now you've got Van Hollen, who looks like a complete tool. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=207.0s)]
*  This stuff sticks with you when you fall for this crap. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=210.0s)]
*  Jesse, yesterday I was like, maybe he didn't really think this through, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=214.0s)]
*  but apparently they thought it through and they are doubling down on it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=217.0s)]
*  Well, we have a rule on primetime. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=221.0s)]
*  We have to have some Democrats on the staff and we have to have some feminists, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=223.0s)]
*  because if I just have people that just say, yes, Jesse, I'll get fired. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=228.0s)]
*  You have to have a line that you can't cross. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=233.0s)]
*  And I blame his staff. They have dumb staff. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=236.0s)]
*  You have to rely on staff to tell you, turn the plane around. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=240.0s)]
*  Or this guy, maybe he's really not dad of the year. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=244.0s)]
*  If you are street smart, remember, Greg, we were in the green room during Smollett. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=249.0s)]
*  We were like, I don't think so here. He's going out for a sandwich at midnight. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=253.0s)]
*  I don't think this is right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=258.0s)]
*  That's green room smart. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=260.0s)]
*  This is green room smart. Okay. Maybe not book smart, but I'll take green room smart. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=261.0s)]
*  When you know a guy is arrested in a gang sweep of other MS-13 members, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=266.0s)]
*  you know he's not just hanging with the wrong crowd on accident, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=272.0s)]
*  because it's said in the detective's report, MS-13 only hang out with other MS-13. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=276.0s)]
*  If they hang out with someone outside MS-13, it compromises the gang. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=282.0s)]
*  So if you're in a group of MS-13, you're in MS-13. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=288.0s)]
*  So that's how I knew this guy was bad news. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=292.0s)]
*  And now we're finding out he was pulled over in Tennessee a couple years ago [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=294.0s)]
*  with like eight guys in his car. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=299.0s)]
*  And he told the cop, oh, yeah, we're going to a job. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=301.0s)]
*  I'm just taking him from Texas to Maryland. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=304.0s)]
*  He's an obvious human trafficker. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=307.0s)]
*  And he wasn't arrested then because guess what? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=310.0s)]
*  Biden didn't do anything back then. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=313.0s)]
*  If you are going to talk about the rule of law and due process, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=315.0s)]
*  you have to have a victim that is pure. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=319.0s)]
*  You can't have a Floyd. You can't have a Smollett. You can't have a Garcia. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=322.0s)]
*  Your example of victimhood has to be a sympathetic victim, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=326.0s)]
*  not someone who beats his wife and traffics humans [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=332.0s)]
*  and is in a bloodthirsty gang that rapes and murders people. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=335.0s)]
*  Remember that ad in the last election? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=339.0s)]
*  And it was Kamala Harris wants to do sex change operations on illegal aliens in prison. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=343.0s)]
*  This ad is going to run all midterm, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=348.0s)]
*  that the Democrats are trying to jailbreak an MS-13 wife-beating, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=351.0s)]
*  human-smuggling gang member, and that is going to kill them this midterm. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=356.0s)]
*  How will Democrats respond to that? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=361.0s)]
*  Good to be with you all. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=364.0s)]
*  Send them in a way there's no doubt the country is with the president. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=365.0s)]
*  And I disagree with you about George Floyd. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=368.0s)]
*  He was killed on the side of the street by police officers. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=370.0s)]
*  Yes, but not the greatest human. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=372.0s)]
*  Autopsy would agree. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=374.0s)]
*  We're about none of us are. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=376.0s)]
*  Let he without sin raise their hand here at the table. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=377.0s)]
*  I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=380.0s)]
*  Well, go figure. My hand is on. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=382.0s)]
*  Go figure. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=384.0s)]
*  Two, Democrats, you all are right. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=386.0s)]
*  The message you're giving Democrats, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=388.0s)]
*  this is going to run like the transgender ad ran. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=389.0s)]
*  It's going to run like the ad when Kamala Harris was asked, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=392.0s)]
*  what would she do differently? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=395.0s)]
*  Was not able to answer the question. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=397.0s)]
*  What I don't understand, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=398.0s)]
*  and I get the issues of due process and the legal concerns my party may have, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=399.0s)]
*  but let the court sort that out. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=403.0s)]
*  I think trying to find your way down there, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=405.0s)]
*  it would be much better to see senators, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=407.0s)]
*  Democratic senators and congressmen outside of auto repair shops, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=409.0s)]
*  showing how prices are going up, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=412.0s)]
*  outside of car dealerships showing how the price of cars are going up [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=414.0s)]
*  because of this unbelievably, I think, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=417.0s)]
*  ill misguided plan the president has on terror. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=419.0s)]
*  So it would be great to show them at grocery stores. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=422.0s)]
*  Why not go to closed social security offices and veterans affairs, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=424.0s)]
*  services centers across the country and show how veterans, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=428.0s)]
*  to your point, where veterans should be prioritized. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=431.0s)]
*  Why not go with a group of retirees and veterans to say, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=433.0s)]
*  look, their 401Ks are shrinking because of what's happening, Mr. President. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=435.0s)]
*  What you're doing is not working. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=439.0s)]
*  My only advice to Democrats, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=440.0s)]
*  I think we have to step back and realize, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=442.0s)]
*  as I tried to share yesterday about the great Bill Russell, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=445.0s)]
*  you enter politics to win and to be able to make a difference in people's lives. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=448.0s)]
*  And the only way you're able to do that successfully and persistently [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=452.0s)]
*  is to win elections. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=455.0s)]
*  And issues we are choosing to highlight are not issues that are going to win elections. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=457.0s)]
*  They may be issues worthy, worthy of attention. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=461.0s)]
*  Let the courts deal with this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=464.0s)]
*  This is not a matter that United States senators should be traveling to El Salvador [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=466.0s)]
*  at a time in which the country where Americans are paying more for the things they need [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=470.0s)]
*  or worried more about their kids' education and concerned about their futures. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=474.0s)]
*  This issue here does not lend itself to that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=478.0s)]
*  I wanted to mention that, so Senator Van Hollen, he gets there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=481.0s)]
*  He doesn't get to see Garcia. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=484.0s)]
*  He basically goes on a sightseeing expedition to El Salvador for 24 hours. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=486.0s)]
*  But I think it might be better for him in the long run. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=489.0s)]
*  Because if the pictures were of him coddling and trying to make feel better [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=492.0s)]
*  a MS13 gang member, alleged, whatever, proven, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=497.0s)]
*  that might have been worse for him in the long run. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSvNZDNRpc&t=501.0s)]
