# 'The Five' on Trump's 'palace in the sky' gift from Qatar
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI)
*  It's the dawn of a new Middle East President Trump and cutter for day two of his Mideast diplomatic blitz [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=0.0s)]
*  Putting commerce over conflict as he cuts more economic deals in court's peace [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=5.94s)]
*  Donald the dove lifting sanctions on Syria and meeting with their new president urging him to sign on to the Abraham Accords with Israel [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=10.36s)]
*  He also signaled some wiggle room for a new Iran deal [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=16.42s)]
*  47 also securing a historic 1.2 trillion dollar economic commitment in Qatar and complimented them on the decor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=19.84s)]
*  as a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=27.16s)]
*  Construction person I'm seeing perfect marble. This is what they call perfecto. We appreciate those camels [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=28.66s)]
*  I haven't seen [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=35.56s)]
*  Both tall handsome guys that happen to be very smart. I want to make a deal with Iran [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=37.58s)]
*  I want to do something if it's possible, but for that to happen it must stop sponsoring terror [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  We are currently exploring normalizing relations with Syria's new government as you know [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=48.66s)]
*  I'm also ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria to give them a fresh start [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=53.94s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and as Trump racks up trillions and deals from the Gulf states all the Dems and media want to do is hound the prez over [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=59.38s)]
*  A luxury jumbo jet offer from cutter [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  My attitude is why wouldn't I accept the gift? He does not believe in rules and laws and norms [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=68.86s)]
*  He thinks therefore for suckers this flying grift or [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=75.26s)]
*  Khan Air Force one [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=80.26s)]
*  This is all about is getting a 400 million dollar aircraft for Donald Trump when he leaves the presidency this administration is corrupt full and through [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=81.7s)]
*  Hmm. It's kind of funny. It's a funny story Kennedy, although it does give them something to talk about because [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=90.22s)]
*  Everything in this and this trip is a win. It's just deliverables [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=97.42s)]
*  Everything one after the other is a win-win win here you play with the little story about the plane [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=101.7s)]
*  Yes, but if you if you read the left-leaning media [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=106.66s)]
*  They're like well P hasn't really done any deals with with Syria and Ron and he called the new Syrian president a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  Terrorist a jihadist not long ago, but the plane I [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=117.46s)]
*  I don't think the plane is that great of an idea to accept because I think that if we are [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=121.82s)]
*  forcing Democrats and the Biden family which was [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=129.22s)]
*  Famous for decades of grift and if we're holding them to account [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=132.62s)]
*  Then I think it's a political mistake to be doing something that could be construed as the same thing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you got to act better than your your predecessor [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=142.78s)]
*  Yeah, even if you're in the right employ the political golden rule, which is if it's wrong for them [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  It's wrong for us and why? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  Distract from the the phenomenal wins that have happened over the last 10 days [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=152.82s)]
*  You know, it's interesting Dan I was asked this question in the break the other one not that other one [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=157.5s)]
*  They he notices the camels and the marble if they were to come here. What do you think they would notice? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=162.9s)]
*  I would love please come with me and walk the streets [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=169.76s)]
*  Why do you have so many people on the streets fun if President Trump came and we're like sir [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=173.82s)]
*  Can we walk will you will you walk with me to my dance lesson today? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=178.1s)]
*  Because I would you've got to see this and do something about it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=181.06s)]
*  I'm dying for him to go on the subway and then it'll get fixed and that would be an amazing thing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=183.5s)]
*  I wrote down distraction. I'm crossing it off. No need to talk about that because she said it. I think this is [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=187.5s)]
*  Remarkable what he's done with Syria. So yes. Yes. She hottest. Yes prisoner at Abu Ghraib [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=194.26s)]
*  Yes, somebody who got rid of Assad everybody forgets that Assad is cool in his heels in Moscow hasn't been thrown out of a window yet [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=201.1s)]
*  That's what I guess that's a plus for him. But in Syria, it's remarkable that President Trump would say [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=208.04s)]
*  Okay, I'll give you here's a deal if you meet these benchmarks [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=213.46s)]
*  You got to get rid of terrorism. You got to do all several of the things and they're tough [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=218.22s)]
*  Requirements then no more sanctions on you [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=223.22s)]
*  So this is a chance for Syria for the first time since 1979 to join the rest of the world and you can see [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  Putting these pieces together what I do like about [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  Economic diplomacy is that it is our superpower [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=235.3s)]
*  We can use it very well and they want to invest in America. We can invest in them [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=238.26000000000002s)]
*  I think economic ties are very very good [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=242.58s)]
*  I also believe in medical ties and you know the health ties bow ties freedom now bow ties [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=245.3s)]
*  I'm not really for I mean on some people they're fine. Whatever bolo ties though. I really like [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=251.28s)]
*  The last thing I would say is we said that he said that there is wiggle room on Iran, but [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=256.26s)]
*  He says a lot of things about making a deal with Iran, but he does always say [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=263.14s)]
*  But they should not be allowed to have a nuclear weapon [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=267.02000000000004s)]
*  But that gets sort of pushed to the side because people want to play and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=270.14s)]
*  Suggest that he is going to be willing to allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=275.74s)]
*  I don't think that's fair to him [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=280.3s)]
*  but I think that the White House comes people need to understand and maybe they do that he has to say that over and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=281.98s)]
*  Over again because the media or the left or whoever it is wants to try to pull him back from that red line [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=286.98s)]
*  Harold it seems that this is kind of the way Trump always viewed this foreign policy all commerce no combat [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=293.86s)]
*  So I differ slightly and it's hard for me to differ with my pal Dana on a substance [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  I do I do on the Syria thing for this reason. I don't know [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=308.98s)]
*  Where the national strategic? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=313.14s)]
*  Security interests are and what we're doing I take you at what everything you said [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=316.42s)]
*  Face value Abraham Accords, I'm talking about Syria. Yeah, I mean Syria joins the Abraham Accords, but they have been and we've really we [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=320.18s)]
*  Yes, the Saudis Saudis also [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=328.26s)]
*  The reason I say this is because the president says a lot of things the beginning of a week and in a couple weeks later [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=330.42s)]
*  He says something different [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=335.62s)]
*  we remember we had a lot of tariffs on a lot of countries and he suspended all of them for 90 days and kept the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=336.9s)]
*  Ones on China and then things got wishy-washy with the market [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=341.82s)]
*  He took the things off China. So we now have another 90 days for that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=345.54s)]
*  You take a plane from a group of people that we've said around this table. I've heard all of us say [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  The Qataris they harbored Hamas. I didn't hear him at all say [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=355.86s)]
*  I'll accept this plane if you guys renounce this and tell me you'll never do this again [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  It all seems a little about about him now. He could be exactly right [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=364.62s)]
*  I'm not suggesting the president's not right about this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=368.44s)]
*  But I don't understand how you go to a country and say to people in front of you the 2020 election was rigged [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=370.48s)]
*  I don't believe it was but even if it was the people you're saying in front of mr. President [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=377.14s)]
*  They don't even have elections. I the thing that troubles me the most is I think about it in overarching way [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  I don't mind us resetting in talking about a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=386.34s)]
*  Recharge and a redo of our role in the world [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=390.58s)]
*  But we are forced for good for democracy for rule of law for decency for writing wrongs [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=393.18s)]
*  And if we're gonna change that I think we deserve to hear more than just the president being in a US-Saudi conference [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  Praising these men for the great work that they're doing and for the business deals are doing [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=406.34s)]
*  I love commerce as much as anyone the commerce to me does not at all is [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=410.09999999999997s)]
*  Not at all greater than whom we are as a nation and what we mean for the 250 years [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=414.9s)]
*  We've been on this earth because we've been a force for so much good [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=419.14s)]
*  And I hope and pray we continue to be and I just want to hear the president articulate [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=421.94s)]
*  You don't know China you you're all high and mighty with the Mideast, but you don't act that way with China [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=425.86s)]
*  I'm the one that acts that way with China. I want to bow [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=430.86s)]
*  China you hate tariffs [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=433.18s)]
*  Put me in with the communist China that is you're absolutely wrong [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=436.26s)]
*  Just did rewind it just put you in with them and Dana is so right [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=439.36s)]
*  What he's trying to do is create a peace and prosperity [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  Framework in this region so we can pivot away from it go back to the Western Hemisphere and realign ourselves into the Near East [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=446.1s)]
*  Listen if you peel [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=453.7s)]
*  Syria away from Russia and you lift sanctions and then you cut a nuke deal with the Iranians and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=456.78s)]
*  Lift the embargo and get the oil back online and tell the Saudis to pump more oil it drives the price of oil down [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=462.82s)]
*  It starves the war machine in Russia and forces Putin to negotiate with Zelensky [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=469.26s)]
*  Then you sell chips and arms to the Saudis and you get these guys to do business with Israel [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=475.12s)]
*  You step back up with the Abraham Accords so everybody can trade with each other and trade with us and then we all get rich [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=480.46s)]
*  The only thing hanging up this thing is the Hamas situation if [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=487.9s)]
*  That just that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=492.98s)]
*  Yahoo can settle this thing then the Saudis will come on board and we can all be [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=494.48s)]
*  Fine and on the plane Harold [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=499.94s)]
*  He's gonna take the plane and then you guys are gonna do nothing about it and the press is gonna ride on it [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=501.94s)]
*  And then if you win in the midterms, you're gonna impeach him. So what? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=506.86s)]
*  Okay, and then Kamala is gonna win and she's not gonna go on the new jet. She's gonna go on the one for 1990 [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKCfT0EUlI&t=511.65999999999997s)]
