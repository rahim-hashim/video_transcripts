# 'The Five’: ‘Cover-up queen’ KJP ripped for ‘kiss and tell’ Biden book
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk)
*  Well, the cover-up queen is cashing in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=0.0s)]
*  How do we get out of this? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=3.2s)]
*  How do we protect our democracy? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=4.7s)]
*  And this is my answer. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=6.7s)]
*  And what I mean by that is, in an era of misinformation, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=9.24s)]
*  disinformation, what I have decided to do, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=12.6s)]
*  and I really have thought long and hard about this, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=15.32s)]
*  is to follow my own compass. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  They are cheap fakes video. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=20.76s)]
*  They are done in bad faith. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=22.38s)]
*  Is anyone in the White House hiding information [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=23.84s)]
*  about the president's health or his ability [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  to do the job day to day? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=29.68s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=31.08s)]
*  He is as sharp as ever. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=31.92s)]
*  There's been no cover-up. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=33.68s)]
*  Want to be very clear about that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=35.28s)]
*  Those didn't age well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=37.64s)]
*  Well, if you haven't heard by now, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=38.84s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre is leaving the Democratic Party [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=40.24s)]
*  and writing a book. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=43.24s)]
*  Suffice to say, ex-Biden staffers, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=44.6s)]
*  they were not happy trashing the former press secretary [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=47.0s)]
*  like crazy, some calling it a grift, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=49.72s)]
*  others a bizarre cash grab. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=52.2s)]
*  Former Biden policy advisor Tim Wu hosted, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=55.36s)]
*  then deleted this, quote, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=58.76s)]
*  "'The real problem with Corrine Jean-Pierre [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=60.44s)]
*  was that she was kind of dumb. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=62.32s)]
*  No interest in understanding harder topics, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=64.4s)]
*  just gave random, incoherent answers on policy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=66.92s)]
*  Ouch.'" [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=70.36s)]
*  Even the usual lapdogs in the media [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=71.44s)]
*  could not hide their mockery. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=73.32s)]
*  This is just all an attempt to sell books, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  and that is what the general consensus is right now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=78.4s)]
*  There's something called loyalty, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  and that there's, you should not go out and kiss and tell [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=83.8s)]
*  and kind of papoo your colleagues [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=87.68s)]
*  and papoo your Democratic Party [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=89.96s)]
*  that puts you on this pedestal. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=91.44s)]
*  As a Democrat myself, what I would rather see [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=92.8s)]
*  is people rolling up their sleeves. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=95.12s)]
*  Like, you got a solution, bring it to the table. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=96.48s)]
*  I don't think I can emphasize how brutal this is. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=101.0s)]
*  Former colleagues, you know, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=102.92s)]
*  she's probably wondering who these people are, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=104.16s)]
*  criticizing her personally, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=106.32s)]
*  saying she was one of the most ineffectual, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=107.88s)]
*  unprepared people I've ever worked with. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=109.84s)]
*  She had meltdowns after interviews [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=112.84s)]
*  that asked about a topic not sent by producers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=114.52s)]
*  Another former colleague, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=116.68s)]
*  the amount of time spent coddling her was astronomical [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=118.0s)]
*  compared to our attention [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=121.64s)]
*  and actual matters of substance. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  Jesse, you affectionately call her the binder, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  and it appears that the Biden White House [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  was not a fan of the binder. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, now I call her DEI Tapper, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=130.32s)]
*  because it's the same book Tapper wrote. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=132.36s)]
*  And now CNN's like, oh, it's a money grab. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=134.4s)]
*  Well, then what the hell was Tapper's book then? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=136.52s)]
*  Not a money grab? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=138.52s)]
*  Listen, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=140.08s)]
*  you can't say Biden was great [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=140.92s)]
*  and the White House was the best since FDR, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=143.92s)]
*  and then leave the party six months later [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  and say the White House was broken. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=149.44s)]
*  If you knew it was broken, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=151.44s)]
*  if you said all that stuff, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=152.88s)]
*  you should have left and let Kirby take the job. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=154.32s)]
*  Remember, Kirby was better, and everybody wanted Kirby, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  but she was a black gay woman, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=160.27999999999997s)]
*  and you couldn't touch her [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=161.92s)]
*  because of this whole DEI structure they had. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  And so everybody else, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=166.32s)]
*  and so everybody out there saying the same thing we did. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=169.28s)]
*  This thing comes out and they're like, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=174.08s)]
*  she was unprepared, she was really stupid, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=175.4s)]
*  and she was out of touch. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  That's what we said. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  And we were called racists. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  And we were called racists and sexists, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=180.44s)]
*  and now they're saying the exact same thing Fox said. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  They're saying the exact same thing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  everybody in the country saw. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  It's Tapper all over again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  And everyone knows that's not why you're racist. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=191.72s)]
*  They're for people reasons. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=197.32s)]
*  All right, we'll cut this off. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=198.36s)]
*  Greg. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=199.84s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=200.68s)]
*  You know, I know you are. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=201.5s)]
*  11.45 a.m. yesterday, about when the story broke. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=203.0s)]
*  By 1.30 p.m., there was a Politico story [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=206.12s)]
*  saying seven former colleagues [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=209.0s)]
*  had said the group text light up. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=211.28s)]
*  That's two hours. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=212.52s)]
*  I mean, thinking of you, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=213.36s)]
*  you only have four former colleagues on the five, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=214.4s)]
*  but imagine if you announced a book, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=217.08s)]
*  and by two hours later, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  you had your four former colleagues [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=220.08s)]
*  leaking to Politico. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=221.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know what? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=222.84s)]
*  Jesse kinda said everything I was gonna say, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=224.56s)]
*  but I'm gonna defend her. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=226.84s)]
*  It's on the Dems. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=229.52s)]
*  They didn't hire her for loyalty. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=231.56s)]
*  They didn't hire her for competence. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=233.88s)]
*  They hired her because she checks more boxes [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=236.2s)]
*  than an Amazon driver. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=238.26s)]
*  By showing up, she fulfilled the job, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=241.68s)]
*  and they used her identity [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=245.08s)]
*  to shield the malfeasance of a coverup. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=246.56s)]
*  If you do come hard at her, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=248.8s)]
*  it's because you're obviously racist. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=250.38s)]
*  You know, and there are no loyalties [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=253.26s)]
*  in intersectionality or identity politics, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=256.94s)]
*  because by definition, it is transactional. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=260.94s)]
*  My identity is the commodity, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=263.84s)]
*  and you get nothing more. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=266.26s)]
*  I'm here as a person because of what I am. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=267.97999999999996s)]
*  They hired a black lesbian, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  and they didn't expect anything beyond that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=273.46s)]
*  You know, I'm gonna pretend I'm Jesse [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  and use a troubling analogy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=278.34s)]
*  Trouble. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=280.98s)]
*  Permission granted. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=283.06s)]
*  Kaylee, you know, KJP, he's like a really hot girl, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  hired as a hostess at the restaurant. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=288.18s)]
*  You know, she's only there because she's hot, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=292.22s)]
*  but if you expect her to answer the phones [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=294.70000000000005s)]
*  or check on a reservation, that's your fault. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=296.66s)]
*  You got me. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=299.44s)]
*  You got me. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=301.58000000000004s)]
*  Well done, well played. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=303.42s)]
*  You know, Sandra, I'm just thinking, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=304.74s)]
*  sitting in that office, you know, she's... [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=310.38s)]
*  She's seeing private publicist on emails, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  government emails, and her colleagues reported her [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=315.32s)]
*  to White House Counsel's office. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=318.26000000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's crazy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=320.38s)]
*  What was she doing? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  I think about the amount of viewers [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=322.62s)]
*  that we have in daytime television on Fox News Channel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  She wouldn't give interviews. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the entire time that she held that position, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=328.1s)]
*  she would not come and give an interview. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=330.94s)]
*  We covered many of these White House press briefings. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=332.42s)]
*  We carried them live during our show, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=334.54s)]
*  and I don't think there was anybody who was watching her [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=336.06s)]
*  and thinking, wow, she's really in the inner circle [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=338.5s)]
*  of what's going on. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=342.46s)]
*  You got the impression that she was kind of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  just shoved out the door to act the part [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=345.62s)]
*  of the White House press secretary, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=347.9s)]
*  but we really questioned whether or not [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=349.5s)]
*  she was really giving us, you know, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=351.02s)]
*  real information from the Oval Office. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=352.94s)]
*  She spent a lot of that time talking about those [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=356.02s)]
*  false videos and deep fakes during Biden's decline, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=359.14s)]
*  and she was convincing the media [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=362.96s)]
*  and telling the American public they were fools [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=365.06s)]
*  if they didn't believe that that was just [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=367.3s)]
*  partisan politics at play. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=369.3s)]
*  You think back to all of those moments, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  and now you hear former White House staffers [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=373.86s)]
*  that worked with her going on the record. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=376.38s)]
*  Actually, this is a former White House official [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=378.7s)]
*  under the Biden administration. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=380.86s)]
*  She didn't know how to manage a team. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=382.1s)]
*  She didn't know how to shape or deliver a message. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  It often created more problems than she solved. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=386.66s)]
*  You got the sense sometimes when you're watching [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=389.3s)]
*  these briefings, it was like a NASCAR race, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=390.98s)]
*  that there was a crash about to happen. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=393.02s)]
*  So bottom line, I think people watching [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=394.62s)]
*  and seeing this happen think, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=397.3s)]
*  what a disservice to the American public [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=398.42s)]
*  to have that person to have been [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=400.7s)]
*  our White House press secretary [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=403.42s)]
*  answering the most critical questions [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=405.18s)]
*  for our nation at that time. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, Harold, I'm interested to see the posture [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=407.82s)]
*  she takes towards Biden, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=409.74s)]
*  because she calls it a broken White House, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=410.98s)]
*  but she, a month before the election, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=413.38s)]
*  was promoted to senior advisor. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  They clearly saw her as someone loyal. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=417.38s)]
*  Do you think she's still loyal? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=419.38s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=421.78s)]
*  So I take a little different approach to this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=423.26s)]
*  I don't know her, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  so there's no friendship or relationship. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=427.14s)]
*  But I do think, I don't like some of the things [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=429.90000000000003s)]
*  that people are saying, the negative things [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=432.94s)]
*  about her being unprepared and her being not-substant. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=434.58s)]
*  They kept her around for a long time. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=437.3s)]
*  If they didn't want, if they thought that was the case, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=438.7s)]
*  certainly anyone could not be prepared [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  and not be substantive, and you fired them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  They didn't do that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  Two, I don't like what she's done. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=445.54s)]
*  I hate kiss and tellers. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=447.18s)]
*  You don't work for the president of the United States [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  and have that kind of proximate to them, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=450.42s)]
*  and then write a kiss and tell book. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=452.14s)]
*  I think your point about the DEI thing is pretty funny. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=454.34s)]
*  And Jesse's not a racist, he just plays one on TV. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=457.34s)]
*  Ah! [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=459.73999999999995s)]
*  I'm joking. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=462.02s)]
*  Two, I think the people who are saying [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=463.02s)]
*  some of these things about her [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=465.38s)]
*  and questioning her substance and so forth, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=466.7s)]
*  I guess at some point, they don't know [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=469.02s)]
*  what she's gonna write in this book. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  She talked about a White House that was broken. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=471.2s)]
*  And I guess to your point, Greg and Jesse, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=474.02s)]
*  you've been saying this for a long time, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=476.34s)]
*  and two of you have as well in your shows, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=477.94s)]
*  but the show has been saying this. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=479.5s)]
*  You're gonna have to wonder in the book, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=481.7s)]
*  what did she know, when did she know it, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=482.74s)]
*  and what did she do about it, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=484.54s)]
*  as it relates to the cognitive decline, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=486.5s)]
*  or for that matter, if she says the White House was broken. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=488.02s)]
*  And those who were responsible for breaking it, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=490.74s)]
*  I guess maybe some of the reason [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=493.18s)]
*  why they're being so critical of her is because of that. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=494.86s)]
*  The whole thing is a mess. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=498.3s)]
*  And I gotta tell you, just as an outsider, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=499.82s)]
*  and someone doesn't know her, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=502.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm not particularly interested in hearing her thoughts [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=503.34000000000003s)]
*  about being an independent. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=505.54s)]
*  I'm glad she is, and I'm glad that she's [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=506.38s)]
*  figuring out her own political identity, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=508.5s)]
*  but the whole thing is a mess. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=510.0s)]
*  Don't kiss and tell, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=512.98s)]
*  don't criticize your colleagues like this, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=514.38s)]
*  and frankly, all of you are gonna have questions to answer [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=516.46s)]
*  about what was happening in that White House. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=519.36s)]
*  But I would just say, it's not just Republicans saying [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=520.9s)]
*  she was unprepared, these are former colleagues. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=522.78s)]
*  They didn't say this about Jen Psaki, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=524.42s)]
*  they didn't say this about me, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  they didn't say this about Sarah Sanders, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=527.5s)]
*  what motivated it? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=529.06s)]
*  You all didn't write books about him either. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=530.46s)]
*  So I just think it's a bad look for all of them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=531.86s)]
*  If you said you were gonna write a book, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=534.14s)]
*  they might have said something bad about you, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=535.26s)]
*  or if you, don't get me wrong, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=536.5s)]
*  I'm not suggesting anyone would say anything bad about you, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=538.42s)]
*  and you got a little baby coming now, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=540.18s)]
*  I don't wanna say anything bad about you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=541.22s)]
*  Right, now, my only point is, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=542.74s)]
*  I think it's a bad look for all of them. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=543.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdSCK-awPk&t=545.5s)]
