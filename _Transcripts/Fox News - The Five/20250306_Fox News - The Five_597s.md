# Gutfeld: Dems are enlisting Elmo and Big Bird in war on DOGE
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY)
*  Public media is the best! Save NPR, save PBS! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to see Doug Burgum in there on the right. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=10.6s)]
*  Democrats are enlisting Elmo and Big Bird as they continue to wage war on Doe, staging a massive protest. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Literally three people this morning in front of NPR. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=22.24s)]
*  By the way, NPR stands for not pooping regularly, which is why, what's his name? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  Scott Simon always sounds constipated. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=32.68s)]
*  Anyway, this comes as President Trump convenes his cabinet to talk shop on the cost cutting crew that saved taxpayers $105 billion and counting. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  Elon also in attendance. Here's what 47 said about the meeting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=44.72s)]
*  I want the cabinet members to keep good people. I don't want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=49.72s)]
*  I want the cabinet members to keep the good people and the cabinet members go first. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=56.72s)]
*  And if they can cut, it's better. And if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=61.08s)]
*  But a Columbia professor claims cutting waste is racist, all because the coconut lady lost. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=67.24s)]
*  Yes, it's an attack on government, but it's also an attack on this government. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=73.8s)]
*  What I mean by that is it's an attack on this government that used to be headed by a black man. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=77.64s)]
*  It's an attack on this government that almost elected a black woman to the highest office in the land. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=82.92s)]
*  It's an attack on a government that has been more welcoming and more supportive of people who have come to this country in search for a better life. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=88.56s)]
*  All right, Harold. This is the point I was making. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=97.44s)]
*  As long as you have a contingent in your party that says everything is racist, you can't build your brand unless you split it off and you have an everything is racist party and the Democrat Party, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=102.44s)]
*  because he seems to forget that you had a white president. His name was Joe Biden. Senile, but white. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=115.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't think the cuts are are racist. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=124.16s)]
*  And I know he's a friend. I just don't think I don't think he's if he said that, I don't think he's right about that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=128.56s)]
*  What I do think is and I've said on the show, there are no advocates for waste and fraud and abuse. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=132.72s)]
*  If there are, they're certainly not. I don't consider them Democrats. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  I consider them people who enjoy waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  And their ideas should not be the ones that rule the day. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  Having said that, I think you can you can also be critical of the way that the administration is going about some of these things. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=146.68s)]
*  But when you poll, as Dana and the judge have said routinely around the table, people are on the side of the cutters or the doge effort [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=153.12s)]
*  than they do on Democrats saying, don't do it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=162.36s)]
*  So if if the president and and Mr. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=165.8s)]
*  Musk believed that USAID and I read a story today that the Department of Education was going to be executive ordered out. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=169.56s)]
*  And I heard a story said President Trump decided not to do that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=175.56s)]
*  I do think if President Trump does executive order out, meaning he bans or dismantles the Department of Education, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=179.12s)]
*  I think you'll see a different kind of response. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  But I'm for doges. I've said the spirit of it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=187.44s)]
*  I don't like all the cuts in Democrats who don't like the cuts they're making. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  Here's a novel idea. Come up with your own. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=193.08s)]
*  If you believe that we should reform government like Bill Clinton and Al Gore believe, like Barack Obama did, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=196.52s)]
*  then come up with your own ideas as opposed to just trying to dismantle the entire idea or poopooing on the entire idea. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=201.72000000000003s)]
*  Poopooing. My kids are not going to like me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=208.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, Heff and George, you don't like me when I use that word. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  Poopooing? Poopooing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  All right. That's an interesting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's Jesse. He don't like it either. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  So Dana, writer Joshua Lysak says that a bad review by a bad person is a good review. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  So whenever you hear this criticism of doge, it means it's good. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=227.28s)]
*  So it's like a double negative. A double negative. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=233.16000000000003s)]
*  I see. I got it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=235.24s)]
*  Not not like a double negative. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=236.56s)]
*  In the five stages of democratic outrage, everything we are mad about is racist usually comes a little bit later. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  But it's here now. This is one thing I would say about that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=245.68s)]
*  And I wasn't planning necessarily to bring up education, but I'm glad Harold did because [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  we have the record low test scores for America's children and no Democrats talking about it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=254.96s)]
*  No one's talking about it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=263.04s)]
*  Are they saying that we should have more money at the Department of Education? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=264.8s)]
*  What are the outcomes you are getting for that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=267.4s)]
*  As my former boss used to call this, especially at the inner city school levels, but now in rural schools as well, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  that it's the soft bigotry of low expectations. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=275.08s)]
*  And the thing about this is you have a Department of Education that is really catering to a lot of different things [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=278.08s)]
*  that it might not necessarily need to exist because the things that people say they like about the schools, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=283.92s)]
*  for example, the pre-K program, that's not done through Department of Education. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=287.84s)]
*  That's over at the Health and Human Services Department. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=291.48s)]
*  You care about school lunches. You want kids to have school lunches but not school breakfast. Great. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=293.92s)]
*  Well, call Brooke Rollins. She's at the USDA. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=297.44s)]
*  You care about military schools? Pete Hegseth is now in charge of that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=300.2s)]
*  So a lot of these things like student loans. Why couldn't that be done at the Treasury Department? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=304.52s)]
*  It's the bureaucracy and all these administrators and all the DEI stuff that was happening that was not getting you [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=310.08s)]
*  to the results that you need to get so that you could actually overcome. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=315.24s)]
*  You humiliated Harold over there. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=320.8s)]
*  Can I say something? Well, I'll say it at the end. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=322.6s)]
*  Because I rarely ever disagree with Dana. Here's where I disagree. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=325.0s)]
*  I actually think we have to have a Department of Education that's ten times size than what we have now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=327.96s)]
*  We centralize the things that we value the most. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=332.68s)]
*  Local governments have screwed up education more so than federal governments have. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=335.32s)]
*  They spend more money on it. They have more responsibility. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=340.16s)]
*  And I'm not saying they're bad people. They just haven't managed it right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=343.68s)]
*  Well, let me give you an example, though. Today I interviewed Dr. Cade Brumley. He is from Louisiana. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=346.44s)]
*  Nerd debate. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=350.56s)]
*  Yes, no, but he is from Louisiana. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=351.44s)]
*  Guess the only state to improve in reading in the last four years was Louisiana. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=353.4s)]
*  You know what? Because they really sucked before. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=359.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=361.28s)]
*  They did. And they said, we don't want to suck anymore. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=361.88s)]
*  So they said, guess what? We're going back to basics. We're doing phonics. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=364.32s)]
*  He said, we do flashcards for math. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=366.68s)]
*  I love that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=368.64s)]
*  But that's not the Department of Education. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  And I asked him, are you OK if it goes away? And he says, yes, it can be the money. I can do better. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  Leadership is saying when something works, scale it. And when something doesn't work, scrap it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=374.76s)]
*  I think the federal government should have a bigger role with local partners. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  That's just because our schools suck. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=382.04s)]
*  They suck. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=383.92s)]
*  If you believe that, and you know where the responsibility is, it's at the local level. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=384.44s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=388.12s)]
*  We need a different approach. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  It's a federal bureaucracy, but it's the local level's fault. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=392.36s)]
*  The federal... Judge, look at the amount of money and look at the responsibilities in education. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=393.56s)]
*  You can do that in the commercial break. Then you can beat me up all you want. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=398.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=400.44s)]
*  It's all at the local... You see what I'm saying, Dana? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=400.68s)]
*  I do see what you're saying. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=402.68s)]
*  You may not agree, but that's the point I make. I didn't mean to hijack your thing, but since we got going on it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  It's all right. I like the fire in your eyes, Harold. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=407.72s)]
*  Me too. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, boy. Wow. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=411.56s)]
*  Smokey in here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=413.32s)]
*  Open education. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=414.44s)]
*  Continue bashing Harold for me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=414.96s)]
*  Look, I think the problem with this whole thing, and by the way, you know what? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=417.08s)]
*  Jimmy Carter, I think I've said this before, created the Department of Education with an executive order. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  So Donald Trump taking it out with an executive order, I think is very appropriate. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=426.08s)]
*  And I honestly believe that what happened, especially during COVID, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  and the loss of learning that our kids have suffered and will never make up for in the next generation [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=435.48s)]
*  while kids in other countries were doing, you know, studying quantum physics in China and Russia, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=441.8s)]
*  is really a result of the federalization of the education. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yvP00iSPY&t=447.36s)]
