# ‘The Five’ on Terminator not 'taking the bait'
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M)
*  Anti-ice agitators who've been burning way most you're about to get terminated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=0.0s)]
*  Arnold Schwarzenegger not taking the bait on the view after Joy Behar and the ladies tried to get him to endorse the anti-ice [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=4.32s)]
*  Insanity that's been sweeping liberal cities watch [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=11.72s)]
*  As an immigrant yourself you are an immigrant. Yes. You're an immigrant in this country [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, did you have a visceral reaction to what they're doing? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=19.44s)]
*  What ice is doing when you see the videos of it? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=23.44s)]
*  I'm so so happy to do to see firsthand that this is the greatest country in the world [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=25.56s)]
*  And this is the land of opportunity, but the key thing also is at the same time that we got to do things legal [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=31.84s)]
*  That is the important thing when you come to America [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=38.0s)]
*  You're a guest and you have to behave like a guest you have a responsibility as an immigrant to give back to America [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=41.56s)]
*  Greg you know what I loved about that. This is like lib kryptonite [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=50.16s)]
*  Which is when you talk about a lived experience plus common sense well, let's be go ahead. Sorry [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=52.96s)]
*  Good [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  The only reason why Arnold went on the view was to look skinny [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=60.64s)]
*  But he is voicing the damage that the liberals embrace of illegal immigration has done to legal [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=68.52s)]
*  Immigration how's it feel to have waited in line to get into Disneyland? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=75.76s)]
*  When everybody else just jumped the fence gotten for free and they're peeing in the teacups [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Because that's what he's talking about if I hear another hack say we're a nation of immigrants during this process [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=84.56s)]
*  I'm gonna deport their ass with my foot [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=90.24s)]
*  You can't say that while you're destroying the process of legal immigration [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  If you believe that immigration is the foundation of this country, then you should protect the process with all your might [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=96.8s)]
*  That's what because what you're seeing right now is the is the consequence of letting that go away [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=103.64s)]
*  The biggest harm the Democrats have done is they contaminated to this system by defying the system. You've heard the phrase [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=109.0s)]
*  This is why you can't have nice things [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=115.8s)]
*  Think about so many nice things that we can't have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=118.36s)]
*  Because of liberalism one of them is legal immigration because they destroyed that but think about women's sports those that was nice for a while [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=122.68s)]
*  Peaceful protests that was nice can't have that anymore safety nuts that safety nuts safety nets [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=130.76s)]
*  You know for people that needed it they exploited that look at our entertainment when it went woke look at religion [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  They put folk guitar in Catholic mass worst thing that could ever happen [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=144.24s)]
*  Our politics is destroyed our comedy got destroyed now. I'm rebuilding it. Thank you sanctuary cities [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  Were the poison pill that killed legal immigration? We're dealing with it now [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=155.08s)]
*  Safety nuts are my favorite safety nuts. All right, Jesse [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=159.8s)]
*  Here's what I loved about it [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  Also is that it's a perfect illustration of what happens when you try to debate or just have a conversation with a lid [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=164.18s)]
*  Which is that they interrupt you so the person the thing to his right kept verbally interrupting and the one to his left kept [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  Touching him which by the way to touch me [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=177.26s)]
*  I will punch you so that they couldn't even let him get his answer out [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  Before trying to jump in and just wipe it away. You're having a great show already [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  Love what you're putting out there [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  Arnold was right. So an illegal immigrant is like an uninvited guest at a party, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=190.26000000000002s)]
*  So you know that you say you have in a party and people who weren't invited show up to the party as long as they're hanging [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=195.74s)]
*  Out having a good time not messing with anybody [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=201.86s)]
*  They can stay and that's pretty much the American policy towards illegal aliens [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=205.94s)]
*  But if you roll up to the party and crash into the pillar and then just roofie the bartender and then slap the host in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=210.5s)]
*  the face [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=216.44s)]
*  You're gonna call the cops right away [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=217.38s)]
*  Democrats are like the people at the party that like hide this guy in the basement [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=220.74s)]
*  And then when the cops show up they fight the cops now [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Democrats would never do that in their own lives [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=229.66s)]
*  There's such a wide gap between the way Democrats behave in their personal life and the way they behave in their public life [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=233.74s)]
*  Democrats in their private lives don't harbor fugitives [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  They don't yell gestapo at police officers, they don't do any of that stuff [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=243.62s)]
*  But for some reason in their public life their animals [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=249.06s)]
*  It's like I can't never use any let's just say Joy Behar invites me over for cocktails in our dirt [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I go over to the house. He's civilized. No, you're having a great time [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=259.76s)]
*  If a fire starts, she doesn't say no, no, no, we're just gonna let it burn [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=264.26s)]
*  She calls someone immediately and we put out the fire [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=269.12s)]
*  I'm sure when she found out what hers was coming over for a derv she went shopping [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=271.96s)]
*  So she's in line at the grocery store 12 people cut joy in line at the grocery store and she doesn't say anything [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=276.44s)]
*  She she's gonna yell. Hey get the hell back in line. I've been waiting here [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  So Democrats the only other people they're like are like actors [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  Because actors their private life and their public lives completely different [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  They'll go on set act like a totally different person leave the set. They're back to themselves same thing with Democrats [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=297.32s)]
*  They're just performers. That's all they're doing and bad at it Harold [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  Here's the other thing that was a perfect contrast between the current [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=308.18s)]
*  Toxic ineffective inept governor of California and the prior one that actually had common sense [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=312.5s)]
*  I say this as a Californian because my and you too because our state went to ruin under Gavin Newsom [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=318.24s)]
*  So I think Arnold Schwarzenegger is like and I like him is like a lot of foreigners and immigrants who come to our country who? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=323.98s)]
*  Love the freedom and opportunity that our country offers. He came with a great work ethic a lot of grit [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  obviously a lot of talent that he continued to harness while he was here and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=338.22s)]
*  He was offered a path to citizenship to both of you all's points that he pursued [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  And thankfully [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=348.41999999999996s)]
*  He met all the requirements and we're better off for him our country's better off for him for for having him in our country [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=350.02s)]
*  And having him as an American. I hope some point we we do two things again because when he came [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=356.73999999999995s)]
*  Emily the path the citizenship was far more defined than it is today [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=363.73999999999995s)]
*  We've not reformed this process in a really long time not since Ronald Reagan was president and I hope we reform it again [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=367.41999999999996s)]
*  So we can ensure we get the very best like him coming to our country and we find ways to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=374.5s)]
*  Export the very worst because there's no question over the last few years. We've had an influx of people [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=379.34s)]
*  Some who should be on the path of citizenship and many many whom should not I happen to allocate a little responsibility [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=384.98s)]
*  To because I served in Congress Republicans and Democrats alike were responsible for not addressing this, but I don't I don't at all [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=392.3s)]
*  Don't own up to the fact that over the last four years under the past president [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=399.14000000000004s)]
*  We had an enormous influx of people who should not have been here who should not have been here [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=403.06s)]
*  And I'm hopeful that President Trump and his and mr. Holman will continue down the path of kicking out the worst first [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=406.98s)]
*  Katie I just love that joy starts with the assumption. Oh, you're an immigrant, right? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=414.94s)]
*  So you totally agree with what we're saying about this issue, which of course is her long-standing position [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=419.5s)]
*  Which is one that Democrats have had which is the conflation and a disrespect between [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=425.54s)]
*  immigration legally and illegal immigration and for someone like him to sit there and listen and assume [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=430.62s)]
*  That he agrees with her on this when you're watching riots breaking out all over the place [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=436.94s)]
*  We're watching foreign flags being you know flown around as cars are burning [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=441.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean how offensive would it be if you're someone who came here legally and you're assuming that you're all in the same boat? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=446.02000000000004s)]
*  Legal immigrants come here and have for many many years since the beginning of the country really and said [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=452.06s)]
*  What can I do to make this country better? How can I be worthy of of the people who came before me? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  How can I be a positive? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=462.9s)]
*  a an adding to what we can do for the future and if I have children or grandchildren with they what can they then do to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=465.46s)]
*  Help their country illegal immigrants come here and the first thing they do is break the law [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=472.97999999999996s)]
*  It is illegal to come here. It's legal to come here without permission [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  It is illegal to come here [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=479.70000000000005s)]
*  It's legal to come here without permission and then they come in and they want benefits [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=480.70000000000005s)]
*  They want you as a legal immigrant or as a citizen to pay for their health care to pay for their housing to get put [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=484.74s)]
*  Up in a hotel room in New York to get a a food card and the list goes on and on and so there is always [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=489.94s)]
*  been a difference between legal and illegal immigration and the left has purposely conflated them for the sake of [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=495.82000000000005s)]
*  Trying to call the right bigots for daring to want some kind of system [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=501.1s)]
*  Where things are in order and they are in favor of people who follow the law and want to be a positive [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  For the country not a drag by forcing [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=510.9s)]
*  Citizens to deal with the issues that come with legal immigration with its crime or costs in terms of local budgets [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=514.58s)]
*  Did you know what Arnold said when he left the view I won't be back [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY60cYBei6M&t=523.34s)]
