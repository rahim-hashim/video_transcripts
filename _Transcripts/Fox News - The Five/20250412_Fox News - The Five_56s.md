# ‘CHAOS’ AGENT?: Democrats hammer Trump with new label #shorts #foxnews #trump
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE)
*  Democrats have finally tested, poll-tested a buzzword to take down the big bad wolf [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=0.0s)]
*  that they've been after for over 10 years. Donald Trump is the chaos president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=5.68s)]
*  According to The Wall Street Journal, Democrats bet casting Trump as an agent of chaos [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=10.24s)]
*  will boost their fortunes. And like one of their cringy social media videos, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  the Democrats were all eager to read from the same script. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=19.44s)]
*  Chaos is still up. Confusion is up. Economic chaos. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=24.0s)]
*  Are sending a message that they're chaotic. The utter chaos that comes out of the Oval Office. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=28.24s)]
*  We have chaos and that chaos is hurting the American brand. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  If the American people continue to feel that pain, continue to see the chaos, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  it will be terrible for Republicans in the midterm election. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=42.16s)]
*  But repeating a word isn't going to help the Democrats [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=45.76s)]
*  dig themselves out of that massive hole that they dug back in November. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHVT7mGdHE&t=48.72s)]
