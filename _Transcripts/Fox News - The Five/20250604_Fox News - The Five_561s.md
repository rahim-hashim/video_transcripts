# ‘The Five’: Dems suddenly love Elon Musk?
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4)
*  Democrats suddenly in love with the guy they torched Tesla's over, called a Nazi, and recently accused of genocide. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk taking issue with President Trump's big beautiful bill, calling it a disgusting abomination, which he fears is bankrupting America. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=6.0s)]
*  The Democrats wasting no time pouncing on Musk's comments. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=15.0s)]
*  Breaking news, Elon Musk and I agree with each other. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=20.0s)]
*  Every single Republican who voted for the one big ugly bill should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=25.0s)]
*  Say something I didn't think was imaginable. I agree with Elon Musk. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=35.0s)]
*  Now that the national divorce is happening with Elon Musk, and I'm a child of divorce, okay, I mean who's going to get big balls? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=41.0s)]
*  I'm worried about him in the divorce. The children always get caught in the middle, right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=49.0s)]
*  And so I just, you know, if he's out there, I just want him to know we're rooting for him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=54.0s)]
*  And the liberal media exploding in delight over the big beautiful beef. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=59.0s)]
*  Breaking up is hard to do. And that is exactly what is going on here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=64.0s)]
*  This is what it's like outside the tent with Elon Musk outside the tent, which is not a good place for the Trump administration to be because he has a huge platform. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=70.0s)]
*  If you attack Donald Trump and Donald Trump says nothing, Donald Trump's silence is the biggest expression of fear that he has. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=78.0s)]
*  Trump versus Elon, what an unexpected, I'm not sure who to root for. It's like Diddy versus R. Kelly. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=87.0s)]
*  All right, Dennis, the Democrats are delighting in this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=94.0s)]
*  Yes, it's a strange new respect, although it is very disingenuous of them to say they agree with Elon Musk. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=97.0s)]
*  They agree that they don't like the big, beautiful bill, but for very different reasons, the Democrats want to spend a lot more Elon Musk is saying we really need to cut more. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=102.0s)]
*  And he's not wrong. And I think that if we were in a perfect world, there would be a lot of different cuts. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=109.0s)]
*  But one of the most important things that this bill does is for someone who's going to be a trillionaire, they might not care about the tax cuts in this bill. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=116.0s)]
*  But if you're a middle class taxpayer, you care a lot. And so the bill needs to get done. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=123.0s)]
*  Right now, I just feel like I just step back. I don't deal with all of the details in every day and get into the nitty gritty of it because I believe this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=129.0s)]
*  The bill is going to get done at the end of the day. Neither side is going to really like it that much, but it'll get done. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=137.0s)]
*  We'll fund the government. Nothing much will change. And then we will go on to whatever is next. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=143.0s)]
*  Greg, they're telling me in my ear that Musk just took his Tesla back from Trump. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=149.0s)]
*  Oh, that's terrible. That's terrible. You know, for a normal thinking person, you can hold two thoughts in your head. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=153.0s)]
*  The bill isn't where the cuts should be, but it's what needs to be done now. It's not that hard. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=158.0s)]
*  And actually, it's loving. It's wonderful that they are that transparent. This argument is not happening behind closed doors. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=164.0s)]
*  No one is lying to you about Trump's mental state. Nobody's telling you, oh, they're going on picnics together. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=171.0s)]
*  You can see it. There's no conspiracy, no corruption. When Republicans, when in Trump's administration, when something's going down, you see it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=178.0s)]
*  This is a reconciliation, not an appropriations bill. There's no mechanism for reductions for like 99 percent of the governor, what the government does. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=188.0s)]
*  But that's going to come later. But we don't have time to explain that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=197.0s)]
*  But that's but and I get why Musk is mad because Musk, you know, he wants to put a rocket in space. He's going to do it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=203.0s)]
*  So he's just impatient. But it's important that he's impatient. We need to have that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=208.0s)]
*  You know, in the A block, we talked about immigration in the B block. We're talking about budget. The next block crime. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=213.0s)]
*  Suddenly, how adult did this country become? The A block immigration, B budget, C crime, no gender, no race, no book bands, no Pride Month. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=220.0s)]
*  And why? Because Trump and Musk, through their deeds, deliberately focused attention on the issues that actually matter. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=232.0s)]
*  And so, you know, the Dems always say we need to have a conversation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=241.0s)]
*  Well, we're actually having the conversation and it's right out there in front of you. You should be really happy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=246.0s)]
*  I think it sucks to be a Democrat because your life is wholly negative. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=251.0s)]
*  If you wake up rooting for failure and it happens, we as a country fail. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=257.0s)]
*  If you wake up rooting for failure and we don't fail, then you're dejected. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=263.0s)]
*  So your satisfaction is rooted in failure and your dissatisfaction is rooted in success. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=267.0s)]
*  That means if you align to their thinking, you're going to lose either way. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=274.0s)]
*  Would you care to respond to that? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=278.0s)]
*  Not a ton, but I know that I have to to some degree. I mean, I'm a pretty happy Democrat. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=281.0s)]
*  You are, but that's because you're around us. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=287.0s)]
*  Oh, it's my conservative lift that I get every day from 5 to 6 p.m. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=290.0s)]
*  We keep you real. We keep you real. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=294.0s)]
*  You don't drift off into some far left loony bin. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=297.0s)]
*  I mean, sometimes, but no one is in love with Elon Musk. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=300.0s)]
*  Politics is a game. And JD Vance didn't like Donald Trump a whole lot. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=306.0s)]
*  Right. America's Hitler. Now he's the vice president. Marco Rubio has all the other jobs in the government. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=312.0s)]
*  And he hated Donald Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=317.0s)]
*  Ted Cruz has forgiven him for saying that his wife is super ugly [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=319.0s)]
*  and saying that his dad was a murderer. Right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=323.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=325.0s)]
*  And he said that about your kids. Anyway, it was only half right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=326.0s)]
*  So for this particular in this particular moment, we have something in common with Elon Musk. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=328.0s)]
*  We should definitely leverage it. That's what's important. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=336.0s)]
*  But I do think that Republicans, including my dear colleagues here at the table, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=338.0s)]
*  would prefer that we were talking about Elon Musk versus the brass tacks of the bill itself. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=342.0s)]
*  So the final CBO scoring came out today. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=349.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=351.0s)]
*  Yeah, oh, boy. 2.4 trillion to the deficit, 3.7 trillion in tax cuts, 16 million all in total [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=352.0s)]
*  between Medicaid cuts and Obamacare credit tax cuts going off their health insurance. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=359.0s)]
*  That's what matters. And Steve Bannon, a huge supporter of President Trump, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=365.0s)]
*  feels the same as Elon Musk does about it. He says you're going to have to raise taxes. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=368.0s)]
*  And the Republicans have a new talking point. Mike Johnson was doing this on the Sunday shows. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=372.0s)]
*  The CBO is a Democratic organization. It's run by a Bush appointee who's only ever donated once [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=376.0s)]
*  to a candidate and it was a Republican in 2014. But the CBO was fine in 2018 and 2019 [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=383.0s)]
*  when their projections were 99.5% accurate grading Trump's bill. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=389.0s)]
*  But because it's... [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=395.0s)]
*  But Jessica, let's just be honest. I worked on Capitol Hill starting in 1996. You can do the math. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=397.0s)]
*  Okay. Ever since then, anybody who is president and has done have a... They hate the CBO. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=402.0s)]
*  And Biden, they hated the CBO then. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=408.0s)]
*  But the point is that it's accurate. And they're saying that it's a lie. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=411.0s)]
*  I actually don't think that it's correct to say that it's accurate. I think that it is complicated [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=415.0s)]
*  and complex and difficult and you can argue it in all these different ways. You can get different people [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=420.0s)]
*  to use different numbers. But the Biden people hated CBO and now the Trump people hate CBO. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=424.0s)]
*  It's like it always happens. It's been going on since... [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=429.0s)]
*  We can all agree that this is going to add to the deficit and that we don't need 3. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=431.0s)]
*  No, that's not what she said. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=435.0s)]
*  The CBO doesn't agree with that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=436.0s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=437.0s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=438.0s)]
*  2.4 trillion. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=439.0s)]
*  They said that nearly 1.7 trillion in tax cuts. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=440.0s)]
*  It would save 1.7 trillion in mandatory spending. Maybe it's because you didn't factor in the tax cuts, but I don't know. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=442.0s)]
*  When you add in the revenue also from the tariffs, the deficit is no longer an issue. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=447.0s)]
*  The tariffs that are going to spike in place. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=451.0s)]
*  The CBO actually, when it comes to what they've been scoring, you could say is not accurate [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=452.0s)]
*  and many would say is garbage in terms of the numbers they came up with. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=456.0s)]
*  But let's get back to Elon Musk. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=459.0s)]
*  When Elon Musk decided he wanted to get involved in politics, Democrats loved it because they had run everything they could against Donald Trump. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=461.0s)]
*  Nothing had worked. They figured, now great, we have this boogeyman. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=467.0s)]
*  And they could not stop talking about Doe showing up in front of federal government agencies, defending things like USAID and so on and so forth. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=470.0s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, they have a disagreement in a transparent way. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=478.0s)]
*  And you have Chuck Schumer just hours after essentially saying he's the worst person on the planet, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=482.0s)]
*  saying that he agrees with him. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=487.0s)]
*  Now you can't go from calling someone a Nazi to then saying we agree with them unless you're a Democrat. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=489.0s)]
*  Because if you're a Republican, they would say that you're endorsing white supremacy and on and on and on. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=495.0s)]
*  What about J.D. Vance and Trump? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=500.0s)]
*  So the point is that Elon Musk has this disagreement. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=501.0s)]
*  We will see what the Senate comes up with. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=505.0s)]
*  The Senate is, or the White House rather, has sent up this rescissions package from the Office of Budget and Management [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=507.0s)]
*  to codify a lot of these Doge cuts. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=513.0s)]
*  Whether Congress will do that is a whole other question. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=515.0s)]
*  But the Doge cuts that the Democrats protested, including in violent ways at Tesla dealerships, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=518.0s)]
*  are getting sent up to the Hill for debate in a separate piece of legislation. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=525.0s)]
*  So Democrats have a problem with authenticity. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=529.0s)]
*  Here's just another example. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=532.0s)]
*  One second they hate Elon Musk and another when they can use him for political purpose, they're happy to do so. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=533.0s)]
*  That was a great special report, all-star panel. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=538.0s)]
*  Well done, everybody. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=541.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=542.0s)]
*  Brett Hume, where am I? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=543.0s)]
*  Up next, Eric Swalwell claims he secretly gossips with Republican men. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=544.0s)]
*  Hey, Brett, at the gym. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTPKt4zfEh4&t=550.0s)]
