# Watters: Gavin Newsom can see this 'game' is over
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc)
*  liberal Joe Rogan is finally here and they added a greasy pile [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=0.0s)]
*  of hair Gavin Newsom launching a podcast to go toe to toe with [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=3.64s)]
*  MAGA. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=7.24s)]
*  We need to change the conversation. And that's why I'm [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=8.96s)]
*  launching a new podcast. And this is going to be anything but [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=11.44s)]
*  the ordinary politician podcast. I'm going to be talking to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=15.16s)]
*  people directly that I disagree with, as well as people I look [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=18.84s)]
*  up to look there's an onslaught of information that we take in. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=22.72s)]
*  So let's take it to the sources without the typical political [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=25.92s)]
*  mumbo jumbo. In the first few weeks, we're going to be sitting [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=29.76s)]
*  down with some of the biggest leaders and architects in the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=32.52s)]
*  MAGA movement. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=35.2s)]
*  Oh, this is so funny. How does this guy have the time to do [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=36.72s)]
*  this? It's not like California is running smoothly. They got [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=42.88s)]
*  fires, homelessness, drug addicts crime. I'm going to start [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  a podcast. We're going to start a conversation. Oh, there you go. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=51.24s)]
*  Harold. Hey, let's have a conversation. How long do you [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=54.72s)]
*  think this podcast is going to last Harold? He's gonna run out [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=57.16s)]
*  of platitudes in five minutes. You know what, I don't want to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  hear from you, Howard. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  You want me to talk? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=64.88s)]
*  So I agree with you. I don't understand how in the middle of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  trying to trying to manage an enormous state, if not the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=69.44s)]
*  biggest state, six biggest economy in the world. But Gavin [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=72.84s)]
*  Gavin's a smart guy. He's got a lot of energy. I hope if he is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  able to pull it off, that what he does is really listen and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=78.64s)]
*  have a lot of people on who don't necessarily agree with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=83.44s)]
*  him. In fact, I would probably have the first six months, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=86.0s)]
*  people who didn't agree with me at all, and try to listen to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=88.36s)]
*  them and understand them and encounter a little bit where you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=91.2s)]
*  can but figure out why why someone's life experiences that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=94.04s)]
*  you think would lend themselves to supporting you didn't [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=98.08s)]
*  support you. And as opposed to demonizing people, I'm not [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=100.8s)]
*  saying he would, but I think that's what the instinct might [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=105.08s)]
*  be. So I'm happy to hear he's doing what he's doing. But I [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  don't disagree with your first thing, Greg. It seems like he [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=109.76s)]
*  has a lot on his plate as is. So I hope he doesn't spend too much [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=112.6s)]
*  time with this. Because I think the real thing is to fix [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=115.48s)]
*  something to repair something to reform something and to make [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=117.92s)]
*  life better for your constituents. You know, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=121.16s)]
*  Harold has changed my mind. I think this is a great idea. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=123.04s)]
*  Why? Well, when you think about it, it's like the problem with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=125.68s)]
*  the democrats is they can't listen to other people ideas and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=129.16s)]
*  they're stuck in identity politics. And they don't [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=132.28s)]
*  understand the terrain of the podcast. They don't understand [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=134.56s)]
*  how to make their ideas last. It's their ideas are built for a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=137.12s)]
*  12 person panel on CNN. Okay, like talk for two minutes and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  then say, let's have a conversation. Would he maybe [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=146.68s)]
*  this is the step out of identity politics where they try to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  explain themselves. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=152.56s)]
*  Okay, maybe that could that could be and I wrote down like [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=153.72s)]
*  what do you need for a good podcast, you need to be curious. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  You have to have authenticity. You have to have some humility. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=159.16s)]
*  No, I like going on. And you have to have some humor. Okay. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=162.32s)]
*  Also, he has a terrible approval rating right now in California. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=166.16s)]
*  He's not doing anything that would actually help him get the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  fact that everybody in California just voted against him [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=174.08s)]
*  on that reform bill on the bail reform and the crime reform [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=177.4s)]
*  bill that prop 36 70% of the state went against him on that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=180.52s)]
*  His own national appeal is limited. We talked about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  transparency in the first block. He is so transparent. The only [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  reason he's doing this is because he wants to run for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=193.44s)]
*  president in 2028. And he thinks of podcast is the way to do it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=195.28s)]
*  I have one other thing. So the graphics of the podcast, you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=198.6s)]
*  pull those up the light blue and the yellow. That's fresh. That [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=201.72s)]
*  looks that looks good. Then cut to his backdrop and what it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=205.16s)]
*  looks like if he's in an olive green study, fake study with a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  little lamp on the side, like, honestly, what are you doing? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=213.68s)]
*  That does not say fresh. That does not say new. That doesn't [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=217.84s)]
*  say anything. But maybe you want to be a psychiatrist. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=220.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. You know, it is funny. He's very ambitious. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=223.12s)]
*  Whatever job he's doing, he's not doing it because he set his [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  sights on the next job. See that when he was mayor of San [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=230.88s)]
*  Francisco, he was looking at governor. But would you go on? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=233.76s)]
*  If he asked you, Jesse, would you go on? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=236.92s)]
*  No, he has to come on my show. And then I'm not out in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=238.72s)]
*  California a lot. And when I am, I want a vacation. I don't want [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=243.04s)]
*  to work. I don't want to do a podcast. The downside for me is [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  tremendous on that show. But you know, compared to all these [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  other Democratic politicians, he's doing better than they are. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=254.72s)]
*  At least he's trying. He's trying to get out of that bubble. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=258.08s)]
*  Yeah, because the road to the Democrat nomination is not [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=262.0s)]
*  through CNN 60 minutes. It's through Fox. He's gonna have to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=264.88s)]
*  do a Democrat primary debate on Fox News. He might actually have [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=270.8s)]
*  to do exclamation. Yes, he might actually have to do this show. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=275.28s)]
*  No, he's gonna have to do maybe yes, he's gonna have to do bar [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=279.44s)]
*  stool. That old media game, like you were just saying, you two [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=282.88s)]
*  minutes and you're out. That game is done. That is deadly for [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=287.08s)]
*  Democrats. Look what happened with Kamala. She tried it. She [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=290.4s)]
*  failed. I just like the fact that at least he's accepting the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  fact that his game is over and he needs to try something new. The [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=299.08s)]
*  Democratic Party hasn't accepted that. So you're right. If you do [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  a long form interview, you have to dig deep on an issue. Yeah, you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=307.76s)]
*  can't say let's have a conversation. You have to know [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=311.72s)]
*  the issue. And if you come on... What's so wrong with that? No, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=314.36s)]
*  it's the same. Usually Democrats don't do that. They go on 60 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  minutes, they ask nothing, and then they edit it. So if you do [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=321.04s)]
*  my show, I will argue with you or I'll just confront you or I'll [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  interrupt you. And it forces you to respond honestly. If you're [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  doing a two hour podcast, Judge, about let's say, men and women [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=335.56s)]
*  sports, and he just goes, well, that's transphobic, then that's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=339.72s)]
*  the end of the conversation. Right. You have to actually argue [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=343.68s)]
*  everything behind that. Right. And you know, the truth is that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=346.56s)]
*  he's not a guy who goes that deep. He's too ideological. All [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  right. It just stopped right there with the ideology. Do you [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=354.92s)]
*  remember a couple weeks ago when the Democrats were looking for [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=358.04s)]
*  their own Joe Rogan, we did a segment on it, and they had these [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  media moguls and they were trying to figure out who should [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=364.68s)]
*  they put their money behind. Maybe they ended up with Gavin [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=367.12s)]
*  Newsom, you know, maybe they said, well, he's our guy. But you [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=370.12s)]
*  know, the truth is that when he says things like, you know, is [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=373.04s)]
*  the reason I want to do this podcast is I want to understand [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=377.6s)]
*  where the mag of people are coming from. I mean, how dumb is [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=381.08s)]
*  that? And the truth is that what he's trying to do is he's trying [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=384.76s)]
*  to be the number one guy to run for president. And yet, it's not [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=388.8s)]
*  possible right now, because the Democrats are so locked into [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=393.68s)]
*  their identity politics, that there isn't any room for [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11PfQgX-gc&t=397.48s)]
