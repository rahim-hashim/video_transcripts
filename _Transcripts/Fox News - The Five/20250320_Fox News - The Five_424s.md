# 'The Five': Why are Dem-run cities 'dumpster fires'?
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk)
*  Why are Democrat-run cities such a dumpster fire of epic proportions? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=0.0s)]
*  Instead of being known for the Golden Gate Bridge, places like San Francisco feature [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=5.28s)]
*  a poop map and drug-ridden homeless encampments on every corner. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=10.0s)]
*  Now, a pair of left-wing journalists are trying to figure out why blue cities are spiraling, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=14.96s)]
*  and even they admit liberals can't just blame Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=20.64s)]
*  It is often our own side whose obsession with process is getting in the way of outcomes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=25.92s)]
*  Five states of homelessness is highest, including Hawaii, California, Oregon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=32.8s)]
*  They're all governed by Democrats. That's not Donald Trump's fault. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=36.64s)]
*  All right, Katie, would you agree with Klein and Thompson there that their assertion that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=42.88s)]
*  blue states are losing not because of Trump but because of their progressive politics? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=49.76s)]
*  Yes, and because of corruption and because there's more regulation on building a business or putting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=56.0s)]
*  a fence in your yard than there is on people pooping in the street or building their tent [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=61.28s)]
*  cities. I mean, that's really what it comes down to is when you're in these places, you're not [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=66.4s)]
*  comfortable, you're certainly not having fun, and it's not a place that people feel like they want [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=70.32s)]
*  to spend their money, their time, not to mention raise their kids and have a family. So it's pretty [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=74.56s)]
*  basic when it comes to focusing on things that work, government that works, and not harassing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=78.64s)]
*  people who are following the rules or allowing people to just break all the rules around you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=84.4s)]
*  and feel unsafe. And you know, Jesse, they're saying that when you focus on this progressive stuff, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=88.88s)]
*  what you're not dealing with real outcomes and real people, and is there any way to be a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=95.12s)]
*  progressive and want a city and somehow balance that progressive liberal stuff and have a successful [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=101.12s)]
*  city? Well, not anymore. Right now, they don't like civilization. They want to tear it down. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=108.32s)]
*  They think all this stuff were buildings bad for the environment. They want to give the land back [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=112.55999999999999s)]
*  to the Native Americans and judge if there's an endangered species like a snail, no progress at [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  all. Everything has to come to a halt. Didn't used to be like this. Remember when maybe you call them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  the good old days, you have these politicians that were more patrician and they were very successful [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=128.32s)]
*  individuals and they would be like, you know what? Yeah, I'll be a public servant. I'll serve the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=133.2s)]
*  public instead of today where they just serve themselves. And then they'd appoint all of their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=138.16s)]
*  successful friends in the administration and you'd actually have good services and you could build [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=142.16s)]
*  things. Now it's like some moron mayor appoints like some even dumber guy to be in the cabinet [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=147.12s)]
*  because like that moron helped them win Queens. It's a patronage mill and no one has any skills [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=154.56s)]
*  and they just steal all the money. Also, lastly, judge, it's the lawyer's fault. And I have to tell [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  you right to your face. There's so many liberal special interest groups and now all the groups [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=164.88s)]
*  have their own lawyers. So if anything wants to get done, you have about a thousand lawyers come [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=169.84s)]
*  and ensue and just nothing happens. How do you think that people who are leaving states like California [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  and identify the move, do they say it's because of the liberal nonsense or do they say we just [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=184.0s)]
*  want to go to a safer red state? They say it's a quality of life issue and I don't you guys, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=189.68s)]
*  you know liberals out in the real world feel a lot like I do. They're not looking to switch parties [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=196.08s)]
*  but they want safer streets. They want a good subway experience. They, you know, they want it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=202.72s)]
*  to be like the good old days like when Mike Bloomberg was the mayor. I thought he was a good [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=208.88s)]
*  mayor. Everyone thought he was a good mayor. Giuliani was pretty good too. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=212.08s)]
*  So their book, Ezra Klein and Derek Chomsky's book, Abundance, is going to be the guidebook for [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=219.68s)]
*  the next several elections the democrats are going to run and they actually are lifting up [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  progressive values. Things like having good health care systems, having affordable housing, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  transitioning to cleaner energy but they're doing it in a common sense pragmatic way. That's the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  difference. They're talking about cutting red tape which is a huge problem and right after the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=241.2s)]
*  LA fires we were marking like oh it's not so hard actually to cancel regulations that you don't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=246.0s)]
*  actually need right like if you need to build housing fast you can do that. You can cut this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=251.2s)]
*  red tape and move forward. The issue will be and it will expose people within the party who are the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=256.88s)]
*  NIMBYs, the not in my backyard people who have all these you know grand ideas about making sure [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=262.4s)]
*  that everyone can live in a nice place etc but they don't actually want affordable housing anywhere [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=267.44s)]
*  near them. You know Greg when you think about Gavin Newsom in California I mean there's so much [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=271.68s)]
*  of California that's absurd like the Tenderloin District and all of those areas they have the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=277.84s)]
*  highest homelessness. By the way they have the biggest poverty level in the country in California. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=282.8s)]
*  Gavin Newsom's not stupid why doesn't he just look at Florida and say if I change this I can be as [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=288.72s)]
*  popular as Juan DeSantis. He's not doing his job. Look the conclusion is pretty outrageous that these [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=294.32s)]
*  guys guys came up with. Left-wing cities suck because they're run by left-wingers. That's exactly [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=300.48s)]
*  what they said. Suddenly the media has discovered cause and effect that the incentivizing of crime [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=306.4s)]
*  and corruption leads to crime and corruption and all of this misery has been enabled by the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=312.4s)]
*  hijacking of compassion. Sanctuary cities homelessness no cash bail. They exist because [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=318.24s)]
*  anytime you oppose it you are called as hateful and then if you get into power and you try to solve [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=324.48s)]
*  it what do they do? They go after your methods. This guy's even pointed out he said our obsession [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=329.6s)]
*  with process gets in the way of outcomes. What did we see with the deportations? Everybody's going oh [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=335.04s)]
*  I'm against rapists and killers but this process I'm not good with this process. Well come up with [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=340.72s)]
*  one you had dirt bags. The other thing is and I know you'll agree with me judge the broken windows [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=345.92s)]
*  theory okay. This was never debunked but they allowed that narrative to take place based on one [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=351.12s)]
*  faulty study when the reality is we live in the broken windows theory every day. The reason why I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=357.68s)]
*  don't come to the five in sandals and a speedo even if I wanted to it lowers standards and lowering [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=364.56s)]
*  standards lowers standards more. Also the women wouldn't handle my sexy feet but we we establish [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=371.68s)]
*  criteria at work it at home base level behavior. We don't leave dirty dishes on our bed. We leave [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  the toilet seat down the dirty laundry's in the hamper and not on the floor and suddenly we think [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=386.88s)]
*  that that's that does not apply to the street. Of course it does. We need to we need to bring back [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=391.92s)]
*  the broken windows policing and the sooner the better and we need to debunk these ideas. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=400.4s)]
*  Whoever came up with them that it doesn't work it is it you don't even need research. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44a3h29XpMk&t=407.84s)]
