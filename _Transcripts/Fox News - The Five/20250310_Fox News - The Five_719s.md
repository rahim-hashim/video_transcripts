# ‘The Five’: Dems admit they’re ‘screwed’
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y)
*  Look, man, we're screwed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, we don't know, Democrats don't know what to do. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=2.32s)]
*  This is a nightmare. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  The Democratic Party is going through [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=6.24s)]
*  a massive set of internal crises. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=9.36s)]
*  You have a party that got trapped. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=12.56s)]
*  Ben Jones dropping a truth nuke [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=15.6s)]
*  on how screwed dopey Democrats are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=17.32s)]
*  as the party swears up a storm to stop the orange menace. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=19.92s)]
*  Right now, Democrats are struggling to land [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=23.44s)]
*  on a coherent policy or even a message [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=25.44s)]
*  to oppose President Trump [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=27.76s)]
*  unless it's nicely printed on a paddle. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=29.360000000000003s)]
*  And now they think cursing like drunken sailors [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=31.44s)]
*  will somehow make the American people like them again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  It's total [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=38.96s)]
*  absolute [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Somebody slap me and wake me the up. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Elon Musk and his hackers don't know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=48.0s)]
*  To think that Elon Musk or Donald Trump [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  give a about our public schools. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't swear in public very well, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=57.76s)]
*  but we have to f*** Trump. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  But Democrats should focus less on the profanities [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=67.44s)]
*  and more on persuasion. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=69.84s)]
*  But even that skill is lacking. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=71.24s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries somehow thinks his party [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=72.84s)]
*  has the Republicans running scared. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=75.2s)]
*  We have the Republicans on the run [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=78.36s)]
*  on three core issues. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=81.84s)]
*  They are on the run in terms of the economy, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  in terms of health care, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  particularly as it relates to Medicaid. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=90.28s)]
*  And we have them on the run with respect to the GOP tax scam. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=92.72000000000001s)]
*  We have them on the run. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to keep our foot on the gas pedal. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=101.56s)]
*  And President Trump's delighted as he sits back [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=106.48s)]
*  and watches his opponents implode. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  There's something wrong with them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=111.64000000000001s)]
*  It's just something I can't even believe it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=113.68s)]
*  The Democrats were having their little signs up, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=117.28s)]
*  their little signs, their little tiny signs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=121.0s)]
*  And I said, it's unbelievable. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=124.04s)]
*  They don't get it. They don't get it now. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=127.04s)]
*  And I think they're going to end up being a minor party [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=130.16s)]
*  if they keep going like this, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=132.28s)]
*  because people don't want to hear [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=133.36s)]
*  about these stupid ideas that they have. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=135.2s)]
*  All right, Greg, as someone who uses profanity quite often. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=139.76s)]
*  Not often, actually. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=142.56s)]
*  Often at work. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=144.24s)]
*  Yes, I'll give you that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=145.04s)]
*  What is the strategy with the Democrats [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=146.6s)]
*  dropping the F-bomb like this? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=149.2s)]
*  Well, they're struggling for an identity [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=152.12s)]
*  much like you, Jesse. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=153.48s)]
*  And they think that shock value might work. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=154.6s)]
*  But I want to start with Hakeem Jeffries [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=157.24s)]
*  because he's saying that Republicans are running scared [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=159.72s)]
*  when actually it's a victory lap. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=162.88s)]
*  And I'm watching it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=164.96s)]
*  This guy is no Nancy Pelosi. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=167.64s)]
*  He's Nancy Grace. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=170.0s)]
*  He's presiding over a crime scene. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=171.32s)]
*  I don't think they have anybody right now in the party [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=174.2s)]
*  that can express one ounce of honesty. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=177.2s)]
*  There's a huge hole in this Democrat party [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=179.12s)]
*  and it can only be filled by one real person. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=181.64s)]
*  Sadly, that person is here sitting at this table, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=184.04s)]
*  Harold Ford Jr. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=187.72s)]
*  And if you don't come forward, your party's done. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=188.72s)]
*  Anyway, I was watching Van Jones [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=191.64s)]
*  and I think he opened the window of a future. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=193.44s)]
*  And that is laughing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=197.56s)]
*  That is like the first time you've actually seen [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=199.32s)]
*  somebody laugh on CNN, you know, in ages. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=201.2s)]
*  And maybe having fun at the expense of your losing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=204.84s)]
*  can take you in the right direction. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=208.96s)]
*  With the swearing thing, everybody does it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=210.96s)]
*  But doing it all at once is another piece of evidence [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=213.32s)]
*  that they cannot think for themselves. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=219.0s)]
*  And you notice like there is no organic outrage [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=220.92s)]
*  or protests over these dramatic reductions in immigration. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=224.76s)]
*  There's none. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=228.48s)]
*  Nobody's on the street. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=229.32s)]
*  Nobody's on the street about trans [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=230.6s)]
*  and nobody's on the street about the death of DEI. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=232.68s)]
*  So what does it tell you? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=235.6s)]
*  They never cared. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  This was never real. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=240.28s)]
*  All of this was fake. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=241.76s)]
*  That means this outrage isn't real either. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=243.16s)]
*  That is why they're doing it all at once. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=245.68s)]
*  It's just odd how easily all of these bad things [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  have been fixed and there's no pushback. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=250.96s)]
*  So when you see the swearing and the singing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=254.32s)]
*  and the crying, you realize it's about as real [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=256.28s)]
*  as Dylan Mulvaney's knockers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=259.04s)]
*  It's all theater. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=261.16s)]
*  It's almost like drag. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=262.92s)]
*  You know how drag is a performance [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  that isn't based on authenticity. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=268.0s)]
*  It's based on extroverted campy drama. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  It's like we know they're not women. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=274.24s)]
*  They're acting like, and it's the same thing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  with the Democrats. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=278.20000000000005s)]
*  No one believes they're actually engaged in the real world. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=279.32000000000005s)]
*  It's just surface level theatrics. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  Generally the media would be compliant and saluted, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=284.88s)]
*  but they don't exist anymore. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=288.76s)]
*  Have you ever been to a drag show, Dana? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  I have not, but I look forward to it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=293.2s)]
*  Are we going? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=294.76s)]
*  The five trip. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=296.12s)]
*  The field trip. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=297.2s)]
*  One of the things about the cursing is that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=298.8s)]
*  I was thinking, I don't have children, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=300.28s)]
*  but maybe this happened with you guys and your children, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=301.44s)]
*  when they learn a curse word [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=304.68s)]
*  and then they try to use it for shock value [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=306.4s)]
*  and to get your attention. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=308.4s)]
*  And I feel like the Democratic Party is like, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=309.76s)]
*  I don't know whether they're saying to them, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=312.4s)]
*  we like this, do it more often, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=314.24s)]
*  or that because the parents are not reacting, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=315.96s)]
*  they just keep doing it until they try to get some reaction. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=318.36s)]
*  Jesse Jr. says booty now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=321.2s)]
*  He thinks that's really funny. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=322.92s)]
*  Where did you learn that from? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=324.44s)]
*  His sisters. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=325.68s)]
*  Have you been with? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=326.52s)]
*  Not me. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=327.36s)]
*  The older sisters. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  The older sisters. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=329.56s)]
*  I do think that the Van Jones segment that we watched, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=330.4s)]
*  that might be the first time I've seen any Democrats [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=332.96s)]
*  laugh since November. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=335.6s)]
*  And that would be a healthy thing to do. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=337.68s)]
*  You have to at least be able to say, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=339.28s)]
*  wow, we really stink, and he was willing to do that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=340.88s)]
*  But there is somebody on the Democratic side, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=343.6s)]
*  it's not at this table who is getting crowds [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=346.28s)]
*  and he's not getting a lot of attention for it, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=349.4s)]
*  but I'm gonna tell you about it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=351.2s)]
*  Bernie Sanders. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  Probably the most authentic [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=354.0s)]
*  Democrat in leadership right now, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  maybe except for John Fetterman. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=357.0s)]
*  But Bernie Sanders is who he is, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=358.64s)]
*  and you can like him or dislike him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=360.88s)]
*  He's been going out and doing these huge rallies. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  He's getting crowds of four, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=365.64s)]
*  and I know it's not a Trump crowd, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=367.2s)]
*  but it's a 4,000 people in Kenosha on a Friday night. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  He had another 2,600 people away just the next morning, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  just a few hours away in Altoona, Wisconsin. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  Then he went to Detroit, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=378.52s)]
*  he got 9,000 people in suburban Detroit. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=379.44s)]
*  AOC is gonna join him on the road, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=382.08s)]
*  and the Democratic party, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=383.88s)]
*  there might be life in the old gal yet, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  and maybe Bernie Sanders at 83 years old [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=388.44s)]
*  is gonna figure out a way to pull it out of that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  Did you see who he had there, that trans folk singer [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=391.44s)]
*  that said God has a huge... [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=394.64s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=396.64s)]
*  I did not see that. I don't think that's gonna fly. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=397.84s)]
*  It might not fly. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=399.44s)]
*  That's a doge of a folk singer. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=400.28s)]
*  I don't even think Bernie Sanders liked that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=401.12s)]
*  Getting out on the road's good, Harold. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=402.96s)]
*  Do you think that's a good tactic for your party? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=404.68s)]
*  Hope everybody had a good weekend. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=407.36s)]
*  The, and it's good to be back. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=409.4s)]
*  I don't know, Bernie Sanders says that the future [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=410.88s)]
*  of the Democratic party, I think it's great that he's out. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=413.2s)]
*  And I think Dana's point is probably a little tongue in cheek. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  He's not easily holding a tiny microphone. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=418.28s)]
*  Right, that he's at least doing the things you have to do. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  I think there's a lot of frustration amongst them. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=421.36s)]
*  I think that's why you hear the cursing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  I hope it ceases. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  I hope whenever anyone in my party wants to curse [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=426.4s)]
*  or to really exclaim themselves [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=430.84s)]
*  in profoundly emotional ways, to think about substance. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  This weekend, or even the last few days, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=437.44s)]
*  I thought President Trump gave us a good piece of advice [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  when he told us to stop holding up signs [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=442.68s)]
*  and to get more serious. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  President Trump said something on the last 24 hours [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  that I find remarkable that we hadn't touched on yet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=448.68s)]
*  He was asked if he thought that the country [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  might be going into a recession, and he said, who knows? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  And it made me think if Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=457.16s)]
*  if she'd been elected or even Barack Obama [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  had answered a question like that, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=462.12s)]
*  I would rightly criticize, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  and I think some around the table, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  not all of us would say, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=466.84s)]
*  how can the leader of the strongest, richest, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  most important nation in the world say something like that? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, we've seen the stock market do what it did today. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=473.76s)]
*  It's down 2,000 points a day, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=477.2s)]
*  it was just in the month of March. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  That's not an indicator of everything, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=480.4s)]
*  but it certainly is a daily scorecard. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=482.36s)]
*  And the question I have is for Democrats, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=484.76s)]
*  why not begin to ask these questions? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=488.12s)]
*  Why not begin to fashion answers [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=490.16s)]
*  to how everyday Americans, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=492.12s)]
*  who put the president over the finish line, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=494.36s)]
*  President Trump, that is, in November, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  who may be wondering why prices [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  on the things that they need the most at home are going up, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=500.24s)]
*  or why it's much harder to invest today than it was before. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=502.68s)]
*  I think raising challenges is part of it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=505.8s)]
*  You then have to develop answers. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=507.64000000000004s)]
*  So every time you think about cursing, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=509.32000000000005s)]
*  and every time you think about singing, please don't. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=510.76000000000005s)]
*  Think about ways in which you can offer serious answers. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=513.12s)]
*  The only way you offer serious answers [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=517.0400000000001s)]
*  is to begin to think about the questions [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=518.68s)]
*  on the minds of voters. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=520.12s)]
*  I agree with you, Greg. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=521.12s)]
*  There's so many cultural issues that we just lost track of, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=522.7199999999999s)]
*  and frankly, lost a sense of common sense about. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=525.76s)]
*  The president had that right. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=528.88s)]
*  But I can tell you, most of the American people [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=530.4s)]
*  who work in class who went to vote for President Trump [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  don't want to see what's happening [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=535.68s)]
*  in our economy happening today, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  especially if they don't know what the end game is. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  If it's tariffs we want, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=541.0s)]
*  if it's paying down the debt we want, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=542.4s)]
*  if it's just a tax cut we want, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=543.8s)]
*  the president should give us that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=545.3599999999999s)]
*  Democrats, if you don't ask these tough questions, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  the president doesn't have to answer them. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  So stop singing and stop cursing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=550.88s)]
*  Let's go to Judge Jean, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=554.28s)]
*  who's never uttered a swear word in her entire life. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=555.16s)]
*  Of course not, of course not. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=557.68s)]
*  Don't tempt her. You could go online. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=559.24s)]
*  Don't tempt her. You can see I've never said boo. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=560.88s)]
*  Look, to me, the Democrats are like [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=562.8s)]
*  a bunch of potty-mouth kids. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=564.52s)]
*  I think they believe that if they swear [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=566.76s)]
*  that they're real and they're relatable [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  and that the American people say they're just like us, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=571.9599999999999s)]
*  but they're not real and they're not relatable [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  because they say everything in unison. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=577.4s)]
*  They copy each other. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=579.4s)]
*  The curse words are the same. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=580.92s)]
*  And there was a gentleman who said at the end there, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=582.36s)]
*  and I don't know who it was, he said, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=585.04s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk don't give an SHIT [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=586.8399999999999s)]
*  about our public schools. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=590.28s)]
*  And I couldn't help but think, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=591.88s)]
*  you think Joe Biden did? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=593.24s)]
*  How many billions did we put in the public schools [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=594.36s)]
*  and our kids were not allowed to go back to school [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=596.68s)]
*  because there was no metric that would allow the kids [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=599.24s)]
*  to go back to school [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=601.68s)]
*  according to the Democrats and the unions. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=602.52s)]
*  But let's just talk about the fact [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=604.48s)]
*  that the Democrats have tried everything. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=607.12s)]
*  He was a Russian puppet, and then he was a Nazi, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=609.8000000000001s)]
*  and then he was a threat to democracy. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=612.36s)]
*  And then, you know, Elon Trump is taking over, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=614.6s)]
*  and then it was, you know, Trump is not happy. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=619.44s)]
*  He's gonna get rid of Elon Musk. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=623.88s)]
*  And they go on and on. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=626.2s)]
*  They make this stuff up. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=627.48s)]
*  Then it's F both of them. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=628.52s)]
*  And then it's like they're full of SHIT. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=630.32s)]
*  And they go on from there. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=633.04s)]
*  I mean, is that really what your party's about? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=634.08s)]
*  She spelled it. They just can't go. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=636.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm spelling it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=638.6s)]
*  They just can't go there. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=639.64s)]
*  But I think what's interesting about this segment [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=641.24s)]
*  is that Shapiro and Tim Walz have now decided [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=643.1600000000001s)]
*  the way for the Democrat party to succeed [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  is to go on podcasts. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=649.1600000000001s)]
*  What kind of podcast? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=650.72s)]
*  Sports podcasts. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=652.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know anybody who gives a darn [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=654.44s)]
*  about what Shapiro thinks or Tim Walz or Andy Beshear [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=656.88s)]
*  about a sports team. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=661.12s)]
*  Plus, why would they do that? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=663.56s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  You're gonna automatically, you know, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=665.92s)]
*  tee off half of the sports team, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=668.04s)]
*  the other half the opponents of the team. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=670.56s)]
*  So they're trying to copy Trump, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  and they don't know what to do. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=675.64s)]
*  And they're so frustrated. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  They're like a bunch of kids [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=678.64s)]
*  who can't articulate how they feel, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=680.0s)]
*  which reminds me of when my grandson was learning to talk, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=681.88s)]
*  and I'm sure Jesse Jr. too. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=684.88s)]
*  They'd get very frustrated, and they would cry, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=686.68s)]
*  and they would scream, and then you have to say to them, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=688.68s)]
*  say with your words, what do you mean? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=690.92s)]
*  Yeah, Gigi's stomping her feet now. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=693.72s)]
*  Yeah, and you have to say, say with words. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=696.08s)]
*  And then they learn. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=699.0s)]
*  Democrats haven't learned. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=699.88s)]
*  All right, thank you very much, Judge Jeanine. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=701.28s)]
*  Up next, anti-Musk wackos are now taking out their rage [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=703.04s)]
*  on Tesla dealerships. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHIa9FJ169Y&t=707.36s)]
