# Greg Gutfeld: As Trump embraces the future, these liberals distort the past
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc)
*  President Trump showing off why he resonated with millions of young voters with some big [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=0.0s)]
*  moves on crypto and TikTok. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  The commander-in-chief signing an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=6.9s)]
*  of cryptocurrency. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=12.0s)]
*  The judge is going to explain all that to us by using tokens already owned by the government, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=13.0s)]
*  estimated to be worth $17 billion. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  And Trump's crypto czar is promising that it will not cost taxpayers a dime. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  Earlier, the president spoke at the first ever White House crypto summit. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=25.32s)]
*  Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=30.28s)]
*  capital of the planet. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=35.84s)]
*  And we're taking historic action to deliver on that promise. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=37.28s)]
*  And here's another move that will put a smile on the faces of young voters. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=41.32s)]
*  President Trump says he will probably extend the TikTok ban deadline if a deal isn't reached [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=45.3s)]
*  in time. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=50.8s)]
*  This is sharp contrast to how the left is trying to connect with young people. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=52.2s)]
*  Protesters singing songs like this during today's anti-Trump science rally in D.C. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=62.2s)]
*  This is a song for all the good people. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=70.2s)]
*  Come on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=74.2s)]
*  All the good people who are part of this family. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=75.2s)]
*  All right, Craig, how's that gonna resonate with the young whippersnappers out there? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=81.2s)]
*  Oh, those people. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=85.2s)]
*  Those hot tunes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=86.2s)]
*  I think I saw them in Coachella in like 1850. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=87.2s)]
*  You know, just a fun fact about that song, and I'm sure Harold knows this, Little Light [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=90.2s)]
*  of Mine originated in black churches in the 1930s. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=96.0s)]
*  First recording was from a prison in 1934 in Texas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  It's a gospel song associated with civil rights, considered an African-American spiritual. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=103.68s)]
*  But these rejects from Peter, Paul, and Mary added science lights the way. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=110.12s)]
*  No. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=116.12s)]
*  You want cultural appropriation? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=117.12s)]
*  They were talking about God in that gospel, not about Fauci. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  Imagine if I started quoting MLK's speech, I Have a Dream, and claimed the dream was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=123.12s)]
*  that a future conservative network called Fox News would reign supreme. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=128.4s)]
*  I don't think people would like that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  As Trump embraces the future, they distort the past. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=135.32s)]
*  It has nothing to do with age either. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=138.56s)]
*  Trump's no spring chicken. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  It's about his engagement to the world, his engagement to the environment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=142.36s)]
*  He's connected like a plug in a socket. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=145.84s)]
*  He understands people's interests and concerns. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=148.28s)]
*  It's another symptom of how out of step the progs are. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=150.72000000000003s)]
*  They use a song with no visceral connection to the topic at hand, and it goes back to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=154.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=157.8s)]
*  If you talk to anybody in the media, regardless of age, about crypto, bitcoin, blockchain, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=158.8s)]
*  they recoil. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=166.56s)]
*  It's like, do I have to read about this? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=168.0s)]
*  You know, it's a few. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=172.08s)]
*  It's not just a fear of the unknown. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a fear of effort. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=174.68s)]
*  It's a lot of work to get up to speed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=176.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, a guy who's closing in on 80 gobbles this stuff up. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=177.96s)]
*  Doesn't matter what thing it is. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=182.08s)]
*  He just goes, have somebody brief him for 20 minutes and then he's on board. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=183.68s)]
*  No wonder he's scooping up young people because he can effortlessly just kind of like walk [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=188.12s)]
*  in on their turf and get it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  You did a lot of homework. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=194.88s)]
*  You're like our resident historian. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=196.0s)]
*  You know why? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=198.24s)]
*  Because I did that for your mother, who is a delightful woman. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=199.24s)]
*  She texted before the show and she said, don't forget, this is Greg's show. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=201.28s)]
*  Well, I told him she's watching right now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=204.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm full of myself now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=205.88s)]
*  Well, and rightfully so. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=207.4s)]
*  Rightfully so. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  In the meantime, Judge Jeanine has offered to tutor us on the issue of crypto. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know where is it? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  There's a strategic reserve, but is this like in the is this where the cloud is? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=217.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  I get very confused. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  I think it's like the cloud. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  They say it's a digital Fort Knox. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  But I think what's interesting about this is you've got Donald Trump bringing crypto [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=225.32s)]
*  from exile and Donald Trump is now the first crypto president. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=230.0s)]
*  And this is appealing to young people like, you know, my kids are really into this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=238.2s)]
*  I know there's a block chain for every crypto or something like that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=239.2s)]
*  But apparently it is it is something where it has bipartisan support in Congress. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  And in the end, I think that or in the beginning, they ended up taking seized assets from criminal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=250.32s)]
*  and civil cases and making that part of their federal reserve. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=258.08s)]
*  So whatever it is, I mean, they've got some foundational basis. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=263.24s)]
*  They've got their Fort Knox. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  They're going to start to explain it to us. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=268.96s)]
*  And then when I started researching, I said, why is crypto good for me? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=270.6s)]
*  And they said it's good for you because you can diversify. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=274.76s)]
*  OK, you can diversify. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  It hedges against inflation because there's a limited supply and it has increased liquidity. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  It trades quickly and global access because of bypasses traditional banking. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  So I guess it means if you're in Iran and you can't use a regular bank, you use crypto. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=293.0s)]
*  It just it is just something that is we're going to have to start to understand it, but it's no cost to the taxpayer. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=298.0s)]
*  So, I mean, as we start getting educated, I think it's going to be a good thing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=305.32s)]
*  And Harold, young people are already educated. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=309.04s)]
*  I mean, they're digging it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  And the president gets that that this is another place he can connect with them, the next generation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=312.0s)]
*  Well, I don't I don't think that's the reason we should be connecting with just because young people are connecting with you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  You think politically there's an advantage. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=321.6s)]
*  I remind everybody in 2019, President Trump lampooned Bitcoin and lampooned other crypto. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=323.12s)]
*  He's come around six years later because he had every right to. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=330.24s)]
*  It seems that part of the reason he's come around is that it's given him an opportunity to appeal to young voters. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=333.0s)]
*  Today's announcement, he created two things. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=338.04s)]
*  He basically directed the Department of Treasury to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and then a digital asset stockpile. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  There are a lot of people who believe that we'll be able to take some of this and maybe even pay down our debt. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=348.24s)]
*  It's unclear to me how we do that, because one of the rules, the president also said we would not sell any of this stuff and you could keep it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=352.72s)]
*  It may have a lot of value on one day, may have not as much value another, may have few pennies on the dollars several days later. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=359.16s)]
*  I'm a believer in the technology that undergirds it, which is what the judge was talking about called blockchain. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  Can we borrow against it? Is that one of the advantages? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=371.56s)]
*  Well, if you have it in your if you have it in your portfolio, perhaps you can if you invest in it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  Jesse fell asleep. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=377.88s)]
*  Jesse fell asleep during that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=379.16s)]
*  I didn't pick this segment. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  Let me say this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=381.6s)]
*  I want to say TikTok. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  I hope the president changes his mind on TikTok. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=385.24s)]
*  He is. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=389.6s)]
*  He has a strong opinion. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=390.16s)]
*  Change it which way? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=391.0s)]
*  Because he was against it before trying to get rid of it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=391.76s)]
*  Now he's forwarding. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=393.68s)]
*  He's trying to save it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=394.44s)]
*  So you want him to not keep it? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=395.2s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  I believe it is a danger and a threat to our national security. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=397.08s)]
*  President Trump believes that that if we produce more things in America, he would he's going to reduce tariffs on other countries. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=400.96s)]
*  I may disagree with how he's doing it, but I understand the understand the notion. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=409.0s)]
*  What I don't understand is TikTok, the Congress, the Supreme Court and the 9-0 decision said that they are what they're doing is collecting information on young people mostly and could very well weaponize it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=413.12s)]
*  And they've said not to do that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=425.0s)]
*  The president continues to want to go. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=426.4s)]
*  But here's the difference. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=427.76s)]
*  They have Shine and Taimu has your credit card. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=428.12s)]
*  They have your address. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  They have your telephone number. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=432.88s)]
*  TikTok's a little different. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=434.23999999999995s)]
*  But the Chinese government, the Supreme Court and the 9-0 decision said that Congress went through this laboriously. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=436.08s)]
*  You had every Republican and Democrat on the intelligence. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=444.44s)]
*  I'm just saying I just think it's bad. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=446.67999999999995s)]
*  I just remember though when it went down for like 24 hours, Jesse's dance videos couldn't get out there and it was a national emergency. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=448.28s)]
*  I want to talk about the singing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=455.0s)]
*  We're back to the singing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=456.76s)]
*  OK, you speak my language. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=457.88s)]
*  I want to talk about Bitcoin. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=459.88s)]
*  I bought Bitcoin, but I don't want to talk about it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=461.12s)]
*  It's the baby boomers. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  This is what happened. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  The greatest generation comes back from war. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=466.08s)]
*  They're all been out of shape after the Depression, too. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=468.56s)]
*  And they had lots of kids and they spoiled them and they gave them everything. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=470.96s)]
*  And all of these children just competed for attention. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=474.96s)]
*  And you get the 60s and they're all like, me, me, me, look at me. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to sing. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=482.52s)]
*  There's no consequences. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=483.68s)]
*  Free love. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=485.08s)]
*  And then they got lucky because you hit the Reagan 80s and then all the way up until now, they rode out the greatest stock market rally in the history of civilization. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=486.28s)]
*  So now they're at the top of their game and they're all rich and they drove this country into a ditch. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=496.36s)]
*  Look at the border. Look at the debt. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=502.68s)]
*  And what they've done is they've turned every program into their own personal piggy bank because it's theirs. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=504.84s)]
*  Everything is theirs. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=511.24s)]
*  USAID, that's my money. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=512.48s)]
*  Green Newscam, give me, give me, give me. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=514.24s)]
*  Even Open Borders, what did they do? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=516.0s)]
*  All they did was like buy a place to house the migrants and they got a six billion dollar grant from Joe. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  This is what's happening. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=525.04s)]
*  This is the last gasp of the baby boomer generation. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=526.4s)]
*  They're going to sing. They're going to do a little folk song. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=530.32s)]
*  But they have not groomed the younger generation. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=532.76s)]
*  And the younger generation is just as stupid. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=536.16s)]
*  And this is where the Democratic Party is. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=538.84s)]
*  You put us in the middle though, like we're okay. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=540.96s)]
*  You're saying that they're not going. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  But Gen X. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=545.2s)]
*  You're not supposed to ask. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  These same dumb people you're talking about. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=548.32s)]
*  After we got attacked on 9-11, they went and defended us and beat those doggone terrorists. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't think they're all that way. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=555.6s)]
*  Okay, we gotta go. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=557.2s)]
*  We'll discuss our generational differences during the break. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrk9ihu0BJc&t=560.32s)]
