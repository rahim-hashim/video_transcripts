# ‘The Five’ explore ‘huge hole’ in media’s narrative of Biden’s decline
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc)
*  Hello everybody, I'm Jesse Waters along with Kennedy, Jessica Tarlov, Martha McCallum and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=0.0s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=5.16s)]
*  It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=6.16s)]
*  President Trump blitzing Capitol Hill to save the day on the big beautiful bill and smacking [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=15.64s)]
*  Republican holdouts in the line. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=20.76s)]
*  He popped up at four separate camera stakeouts to close the deal and of course couldn't resist [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=22.96s)]
*  but to comment on the Biden cover up. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  We're going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation, who [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=30.08s)]
*  signed legislation opening our border? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=34.92s)]
*  I don't think he knew. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=37.32s)]
*  I said there's nobody that could want an open border, nobody. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  And now I find out that it wasn't him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=42.36s)]
*  He auto-penned it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=44.72s)]
*  Who was operating the auto-pen? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  No sane person would sign it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  You know who signed it? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=50.04s)]
*  Radical left lunatics that were running our country and the auto-pen signed it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=51.04s)]
*  They didn't want him and they were disappointed in getting him because they wanted Bernie [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=55.36s)]
*  Sanders and then after about two weeks they said wait a minute this is a gift. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  He'll do anything. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=64.92s)]
*  But Democrats in the media who blew their credibility by participating in the cover [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=66.56s)]
*  up are loudly telling people there's nothing to see here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=70.76s)]
*  They literally are trying to take health care. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=75.28s)]
*  Do you think the Republicans want to fan the flames of conspiracy theories at this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=80.48s)]
*  moment? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=84.56s)]
*  No thank you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=85.56s)]
*  I don't think this is the time for politics but what I will say is that this administration [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=86.56s)]
*  has cut cancer funding research and I think that's so despicable and so disdainful. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=90.28s)]
*  According to a spokesman, Joe Biden's last known prostate specific antigen test was in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=96.88s)]
*  2014 and his first cancer diagnosis was last Friday. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=101.44s)]
*  Meanwhile Joe Scarborough is saying F you if you dare call him Biden's lap dog. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=106.6s)]
*  There were plenty of days in public when he was not the best Biden ever. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=112.96s)]
*  He stumbled and he stumbled and he stumbled and bumbled around Mark. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=117.36s)]
*  I mean yeah he certainly did. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=121.16s)]
*  Donald Trump did, other politicians did. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=123.72s)]
*  But it's actually the same case a lot of times when I've gone in and talked to Donald Trump. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=126.56s)]
*  That didn't seem to me to get in the way of Joe Biden being able to analyze the most [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=133.18s)]
*  important issues and I certainly think he has a better grasp on it than probably the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  overwhelming majority of his critics certainly did when I spoke with him. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=146.24s)]
*  Kennedy, the media is handling this Biden cover-up in a funny way. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=150.5s)]
*  There's factions that are breaking off. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  Explain how people are dealing with this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  Well Joe Scarborough is in denial and his words will come back to haunt him for as long [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=159.98s)]
*  as he is on the air because he was the guy and he's trying to kind of shellac it, gloss [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=165.26s)]
*  over it a little bit right now, give it a favorable finish which isn't going to do any [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=170.06s)]
*  good because when you go back and look at the original tape he's like this is the best [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden and he keeps going back to analysis like his analysis is spot on. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=179.14s)]
*  He is sharp. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=184.88s)]
*  He is fast. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=186.04s)]
*  And it's like no he was a withering vegetable who had real problems and everyone around [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=187.04s)]
*  him knew it and now they're all going on and off the record to a number of different authors. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  We've got four books and counting about Biden's cognitive decline that tell the opposite picture [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=198.32s)]
*  of the magical interactions that Joe Scarborough and Joe Biden had which you know all you had [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=204.72s)]
*  to do was look at Joe Biden every other second of the day to know that something was terribly [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=211.92s)]
*  wrong and the prostate cancer the metastatic prostate cancer that diagnosis is awful and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=216.52s)]
*  I wouldn't wish that on anyone. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  You know it's it's terribly sad and concerning that a family has to deal with something like [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=226.52s)]
*  that but they have managed to politicize it and you have to think logic would dictate [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  that they've known about that diagnosis for a long time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  It is incredibly inconvenient for his post presidency because the other postpresidencies [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=240.86s)]
*  have been very lucrative in modern history and he will not get to enjoy that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  And so it feels like they kind of put that news in there too because they were bookended [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  by the her tapes and of course the book that came out today original sin and they both [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=256.24s)]
*  draw a very damning portrait. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  So there are people who say you know like Sonny Hoss and like we can't make this about [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=265.24s)]
*  politics. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=269.4s)]
*  It's like if this were Trump it would be impeachment. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=270.62s)]
*  It would be like impeach him for what he did you know seventy five years ago and impeach [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  him for everything. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=278.88000000000005s)]
*  It would be a full nuclear holocaust. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=280.36s)]
*  So you can't have it both ways. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  It's either completely political and everything is on the table or the entire thing was a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  lie and we have to move on completely from the Democrat establishment. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  Jessica they're saying they never tested his prostate for cancer in the last 10 years. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=296.12s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=301.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah I do believe that it's there are a lot of doctors who have been talking about the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=304.92s)]
*  fact that now after the age of 70 that they don't recommend that you test your PSA levels. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=309.44s)]
*  Now I think that if you are the commander in chief and the leader of the free world [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=314.12s)]
*  you should probably have some extra tests than the average 75 78 year old. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=317.44000000000005s)]
*  But you know I have no reason to not believe them about that and even Scott Adams who's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=322.24s)]
*  a good friend of Greg's and created Dilbert who is unfortunately also dying of the same [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=327.8s)]
*  cancer. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=332.68s)]
*  He posted a video saying he was going to pass away this summer and he's no fan of Joe Biden [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=333.72s)]
*  but he said it is completely feasible that they did just find out about this and it wasn't [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=338.2s)]
*  some big cover up and even Zeke Emanuel who went on warning Joan was talking about it [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=342.24s)]
*  said he had to have known for 10 years a guy who actually has the same disease is saying [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=346.0s)]
*  his story could possibly check out. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=350.64s)]
*  But he wasn't president. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=353.04s)]
*  Scott Adams wasn't president. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=354.04s)]
*  But Scott Adams is I led with I'm not saying that someone who has the most important job [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=355.52s)]
*  in the entire world shouldn't have extra testing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=361.08s)]
*  I'm just saying that going to this is a massive cover up that's going on for years and that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  he knew that he had cancer and he still ran for reelection. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=367.76s)]
*  That seems like a bridge too far. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=371.2s)]
*  Democrats were very good at self-flagellation. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=373.32s)]
*  It's like our favorite thing to do. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=376.44s)]
*  I feel like Republicans they suffer a setback something bad happens they just move on they [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=377.92s)]
*  plow through and oftentimes they go with the same behavior and they don't care. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=381.92s)]
*  And Democrats we love to wallow. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=384.56s)]
*  We love to say oh what was us. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=386.24s)]
*  This is what we did here. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=388.0s)]
*  But I understand what Hakeem Jeffries is talking about. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=389.44s)]
*  We cannot go back. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=392.24s)]
*  Twenty twenty four cannot be undone. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=393.36s)]
*  There are people who won't trust the media again. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=395.4s)]
*  That's all well and good. But we still have elections to win. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=397.52s)]
*  And we're staring down the barrel of this GOP resolution. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=401.0s)]
*  The big reconciliation bill the big beautiful bill that favors the wealthiest Americans [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=404.2s)]
*  and penalizes the poor. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=408.36s)]
*  And Donald Trump I get it he's very high energy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=409.88s)]
*  But when you actually read the transcripts of what he's talking about he says oh Joe [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=412.64s)]
*  Biden's brain is absolute mush. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=415.76s)]
*  He has stage nine cancer which is not real. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=418.24s)]
*  Oh by the way I just aced a cognitive test. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=420.88s)]
*  He loves bragging about that you know man woman person camera TV. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=423.24s)]
*  And we are also supposed to believe that he's six three and two hundred twenty four [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=426.76s)]
*  pounds which makes him an NFL wide receiver. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=429.52s)]
*  There are and we forgot remember his original doctor who forged that letter about him. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=432.91999999999996s)]
*  Like come on here. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=438.36s)]
*  Come on it's actually comparing him to this. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=440.44s)]
*  This is a math like you have no reason to question the Dems about this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=443.96s)]
*  Are you out of your mind that they're the best doctors in the world and a patient who [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=450.32s)]
*  is arguably the most important patient in the world who gets tested pretty much weekly. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=456.72s)]
*  They have to check him out. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=462.24s)]
*  But somehow they decided not to do this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=463.32s)]
*  I'm wondering do you believe that story or is it possible the Democrats might be [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=465.56s)]
*  lying. That's a tough call. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=469.2s)]
*  Listen to Joe Scarborough just now feeling like I'm watching a Dateline episode and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=471.2s)]
*  watching the husband's alibi fall apart. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  And he's desperately trying to save his life because he's trying to save his job. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=478.36s)]
*  There is a huge hole in this narrative about Joe's decline. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=482.56s)]
*  They're trying to present themselves as a loyal staff protecting an incapacitated [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=486.4s)]
*  leader. And yet the policies were anything but feeble. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=491.64s)]
*  He may have been a mess but the policies were a coherent list of woke desires and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=495.48s)]
*  true the decisions may have possibly destroyed the country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=502.64s)]
*  That wasn't a byproduct of Biden's brain. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=506.56s)]
*  That was deliberate and determined. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=509.12s)]
*  And we need to find out who that person was. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=510.88s)]
*  This is what Trump is talking about when he's mentioned the auto pen. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=513.36s)]
*  This isn't just about a cover up of Joe's incapacity. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=516.2s)]
*  It's why a debilitated Biden was an ideal Biden. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=519.72s)]
*  It wasn't a consequence. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=525.92s)]
*  It was a benefit. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  If you have a feeble CEO then the otherlings can do exactly what they wanted. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=528.72s)]
*  And it answers that huge paradox that we were wondering for four years. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=533.84s)]
*  How did a candidate running as a reasonable centrist a moderate end up as the most [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=539.36s)]
*  left-wing progressive president in history. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=546.64s)]
*  I just told you there the answer the debilitation was deliberate. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=550.72s)]
*  And the ideas that we saw coming happened because of that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=555.84s)]
*  They they embrace his infirmity. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=559.84s)]
*  It was necessary for all this to happen. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=563.0799999999999s)]
*  And now what they're trying to do is an emotional pivot away from our outrage to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=565.7199999999999s)]
*  sympathy and it won't work. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=570.1999999999999s)]
*  It won't work. I can have my then you bring up Scott Adams and I'm glad you did. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=571.8s)]
*  One of my dearest friends a mentor in my life. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  His video was devastating. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=578.52s)]
*  I can feel that for him and also talk about how we need to punish everybody in this [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=581.04s)]
*  White House for what they did to America. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=588.24s)]
*  I can hold to in my brain. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=590.24s)]
*  It's hard to believe because my head so small. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=592.12s)]
*  But you know Sonny Hauston says it's not a time to be political. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=594.96s)]
*  The problem is that they have been political with the issue of Joe Biden since the very [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  beginning since the primaries. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=602.24s)]
*  They didn't want him. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=604.08s)]
*  They wanted Pete Buttigieg. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=605.44s)]
*  They wanted Kamala Harris. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=607.08s)]
*  They both blew up on the launch pad. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=608.44s)]
*  So they finally acceded to the fact that they were going to be stuck with Joe Biden. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=610.36s)]
*  He emerged as the candidate. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=614.96s)]
*  Then he emerged as the person during covid who could potentially beat Donald Trump. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=616.48s)]
*  So it has always been political and it has always compromised the country because this [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  is the commander in chief who 80 percent of the American public said in a CNN poll in [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=627.0400000000001s)]
*  September right before the election was not physically or mentally capable of doing the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=633.24s)]
*  job. So for me it is absolutely I agree with her. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  It is not about politics. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  It is about the risk that was incurred in the White House in the highest office in the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=643.72s)]
*  land by all of these people enabling this person to continue to be president. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=648.84s)]
*  And I think that the the accountability has to go back to that point. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=653.72s)]
*  Not should he run again. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=658.2800000000001s)]
*  Should he be serving as president of the United States at that point. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  This is a real question that needs to be addressed. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=665.2s)]
*  And if on top of all of that he was also having treatments if it turns out that he was [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  also being treated for prostate cancer which by the way is a treatable cancer but now it's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=673.52s)]
*  at a point where it's aggressive. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=677.4s)]
*  These questions are very real. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=679.32s)]
*  And look at what happened. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=681.2s)]
*  OK. We have a war in Ukraine that he said a minor incursion might be OK. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=682.4s)]
*  Look at what's happened. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=686.84s)]
*  You have thousands of people who've lost their lives in this war. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=688.0s)]
*  Look at what happened in Israel. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=691.16s)]
*  You know these are serious consequences that are the result potentially of someone who [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=693.16s)]
*  perhaps was not up to the job. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=698.0s)]
*  That goes way beyond politics that goes to the future and the safety of the country. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=700.44s)]
*  We'll be back next week with a live interview with the Fox News YouTube page to catch our [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=707.6s)]
*  hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDUePDAUhc&t=712.44s)]
