# Tyrus: We have a terrorist group marching in New York right now!
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ)
*  People who peacefully protest for an issue, they're not throwing bottles in chairs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=0.0s)]
*  So it seems like there's no end in sight for the pro-Hamas insanity raging across college [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=21.36s)]
*  campuses. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=25.64s)]
*  NYPD decked out in riot gear clashing with anti-Israel agitators armed with flares at [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=27.64s)]
*  the so-called liberated zone encampment at NYU. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=32.0s)]
*  The protesters ignoring warnings to vacate. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=35.56s)]
*  One officer who was wearing a helmet got hit in the head with a chair. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=37.88s)]
*  The helmet was dented. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=41.68s)]
*  Over 130 arrested, including staff and faculty members. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=43.36s)]
*  President Biden has yet to fully use his bully pulpit to stand with Jewish students who've [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  been terrorized. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Not just statements, a mid-level staffer or off-the-cuff remark in a forest. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=52.46s)]
*  I condemn the anti-Semitic protests. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=58.1s)]
*  That's why I've set up a program to deal with that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=60.1s)]
*  I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  But Donald Trump took the precious little time he had outside the courtroom that we [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=68.1s)]
*  mentioned in the A-Block. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=71.3s)]
*  He said this about anti-Semitism. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=72.82s)]
*  What's going on at the college level, at the colleges, Columbia, NYU and others is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=76.3s)]
*  a disgrace. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=82.94s)]
*  And it's really on Biden. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=83.94s)]
*  He has the wrong signal, he's got the wrong tone, he's got the wrong words, he doesn't [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=86.66s)]
*  know who he's backing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  And it's a mess. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  He is the worst president in the history of our country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  But it all starts with Joe Biden. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=96.66s)]
*  The signals he puts out are so bad. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=98.38s)]
*  And I can tell you, he's no friend of Israel, that's for sure. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  What do you think about the contrast in the statements from the president and the former [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=104.98s)]
*  state president? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  You made a great point in A that he needs to stay on the news cycle and not complain [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  about the court cases. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=115.66s)]
*  And that was a great point he made. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=117.78s)]
*  Remember the fine people drama? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=119.22s)]
*  That was like a year or two long. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=122.42s)]
*  And it was a hoax. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=124.62s)]
*  He said there was fine people on both sides after he said that there was horrible people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=125.62s)]
*  on both sides too. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=130.02s)]
*  Joe Biden is looking at Israel who's just defending itself. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=132.14s)]
*  Hamas came in in parachutes and slit women's throats and then raped them. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=136.54s)]
*  If you are now in the press and you're saying these protests are just a bunch of salsa dancing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  and sushi eating, or a bunch of pizza eating and dancing, a Jewish kid got his eyeball [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=146.5s)]
*  gouged by a Palestinian flagpole. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  They are chanting, death to America. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=156.26s)]
*  They are chanting, I am Hamas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=158.86s)]
*  It's not a peaceful protest here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=162.58s)]
*  So Joe Biden has to just come out and say, I condemn what I'm seeing on these campuses. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=164.38000000000002s)]
*  It's violent. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=169.86s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=171.0s)]
*  It's preventing other people from going to class. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=172.3s)]
*  And it's anti-Semitic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=175.0s)]
*  And it's actually pro-terrorism. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=176.0s)]
*  He doesn't need to bring in the Islamophobia because you don't see Jewish people out there [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=178.44000000000003s)]
*  doing what these pro-Hamas people are doing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  Have you seen any Jewish person stab anybody in the eye with a flagpole? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=187.06s)]
*  Have you seen a Jewish person light anything on fire? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=190.94s)]
*  Have you seen a Jewish person chant, death to America? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=193.48s)]
*  You haven't seen it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=195.5s)]
*  So it's not a time for equivocation. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=196.58s)]
*  Biden really lost that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=198.54s)]
*  I wondered also, Tyrus, about the message that it's okay to just tell all the students [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=200.74s)]
*  you'll have to do Zoom school. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=206.1s)]
*  Sorry, we're going to have to accommodate all these protesters instead of saying, maybe [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=207.26s)]
*  like if I were at the White House, say, why don't you call the president of Columbia and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=211.1s)]
*  those students get to class tomorrow? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=215.38s)]
*  What do you need from me? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=217.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, we saw that in the civil rights movement when black students were escorted in the classrooms [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  when there was. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=224.98s)]
*  And that was the reason for that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=225.98s)]
*  The problem is that we have a president who wants to be friends with everybody. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=227.62s)]
*  And I always get told, there was always a friend of mine, Aaron, be like, oh, man, you [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=231.32s)]
*  got to meet this guy, man. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=234.46s)]
*  Everybody likes him. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=235.82s)]
*  I don't like him now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=236.82s)]
*  If you're friends with everybody, you're friends with nobody. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=238.06s)]
*  Okay? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=240.62s)]
*  Everyone's got a problem with somebody. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=241.62s)]
*  So when you hear the president say, oh, man, yeah, that's bad, but hey, that's bad, he's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=243.0s)]
*  trying to split the diff. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=247.92s)]
*  This ain't a split the diff situation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=248.92s)]
*  And what I don't understand is that Hamas is a terrorist organization, correct? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=251.34s)]
*  And they are responsible on video of murder, mayhem, rape, butchering. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=256.02s)]
*  We've seen all that, correct? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=260.84s)]
*  So if I yell, I am Hamas, aren't I a part of that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=262.1s)]
*  And shouldn't America arrest as many Hamas as possible that might even, again, just don't [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=266.22s)]
*  want to sound near just because wouldn't that help us with negotiations with getting our [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=273.67999999999995s)]
*  hostages home? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  If we have some of Hamas is own right here in America. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, they are Hamas, which means they stand by what these are pamphlet protesters, by [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=281.02s)]
*  the way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=286.38s)]
*  That's how deep their protest is, is whatever the pamphlet. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=287.38s)]
*  But if you're willing to say, I am Hamas, it means you're just not only assuming, I [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  guess, the credit they want for being in Hamas to support him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=294.26s)]
*  Shouldn't they be treated as Hamas? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=297.42s)]
*  Because if we're supposed to be checking our borders and our streets to keep terrorists [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=301.06s)]
*  off and we're worried about domestic terrorists, we have a terrorist group marching in New [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=305.24s)]
*  York right now in broad daylight telling us, hey, I'm Hamas. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=309.16s)]
*  What you want to do about it? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=313.48s)]
*  Under that guise, shouldn't that be, hey, great, we don't have to look for them in Gaza. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=315.12s)]
*  They're right here. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  They're right here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  And in Judge, they've stopped just demanding a ceasefire. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  Now they're saying that they want Hamas to win. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=323.88s)]
*  And with the arrests, the arrests at this point don't really mean anything if you're [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=326.44s)]
*  not prosecuted. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=330.56s)]
*  No, it means nothing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=331.56s)]
*  The problem here is that the leadership has to come from the top. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=334.16s)]
*  And if you've got Joe Biden, who was basically doing a Charlottesville of his own, insultingly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  on the first day of Passover, where he says, I condemn people who don't understand what's [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=343.88s)]
*  going on with the Palestinians. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=349.76s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=351.8s)]
*  You're condemning ignorance. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=352.92s)]
*  But that's not even the point. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=354.32s)]
*  We've got lawlessness on college campuses. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=356.26s)]
*  And it's all over the country. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=359.58s)]
*  This is very coordinated. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=360.98s)]
*  We defunded police, and now we're sending them out to these campuses in riot gear. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=362.62s)]
*  They don't have the ability to take care of what's going on in the city to begin with. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=367.54s)]
*  And then we have these college presidents who are very reluctant to call the police in. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=372.02s)]
*  And by the way, Columbia's president, she needs to go. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=376.58s)]
*  She needs to resign. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=379.5s)]
*  So what do we do about this? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=381.06s)]
*  President has to be a leader. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=383.82s)]
*  He has to say, as far as I'm concerned, I condemn those people who are threatening and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=385.4s)]
*  harassing Jews. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=391.68s)]
*  When Jews are not safe in this country, on campus, this is a pre-1939, pre-World War II moment. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=392.84s)]
*  The Department of Education should be involved, as well as the Civil Rights Department from [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=400.04s)]
*  the Department of Justice. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=405.0s)]
*  And where are all the DEI programs? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=406.84s)]
*  We've been funding DEI for the last year and a half. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=408.84s)]
*  Why aren't they saying these Jewish kids need to be protected? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  And now that we don't have classes in school, they're learning on Zoom, which is not what [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=415.82s)]
*  you pay $70,000 a year for. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  They're basically saying, you know what, Hamas, you won. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=425.3s)]
*  And I agree with Tyrus. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=428.41999999999996s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=429.9s)]
*  Are any of these people, are they here on visas? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=432.29999999999995s)]
*  Are they here illegally? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=435.5s)]
*  Are they here from other countries? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=436.88s)]
*  Get them out of this country. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=438.26s)]
*  Who's buying the tents? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=439.62s)]
*  Yeah, they've got to do, the Department of Justice has to do that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=441.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=444.32s)]
*  Got to stop the Jew hatred. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=445.32s)]
*  We got to stop the hatred of America. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=446.4s)]
*  Harold, I know that you could write a great speech for President Biden, but what do you [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  give it? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=450.96s)]
*  I hope those there are trying to do this, and I hope they do a better job. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=451.96s)]
*  Presidents and professors at schools, you have one responsibility like the President [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=457.76s)]
*  of the United States has. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=463.12s)]
*  He's our commander in chief of our armed services. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=464.12s)]
*  You got to make it safe on campuses for kids to learn. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=466.08s)]
*  And whatever steps you have to take, even if you have to take steps beyond and above [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=471.06s)]
*  and perhaps put your own words at risk against your policies, I think you are on the side [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=475.46000000000004s)]
*  of putting kids in safe spaces. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  This notion of free speech, the judge and we all know around the table, there's a limit [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=484.1s)]
*  to it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=487.46000000000004s)]
*  You can't incite. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=488.46000000000004s)]
*  You can't endanger. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=490.18s)]
*  And for anyone to think you have an absolute right, anyone who believes you have an absolute [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=492.66s)]
*  right to free speech is simply wrong. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=495.94s)]
*  You can't threaten people. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=499.28s)]
*  What we're seeing on our campuses with tenured professors, we talked about it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  Robert Wolf was on one of the shows earlier this week. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=505.44s)]
*  He was exactly right. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=507.28s)]
*  We've talked about the value proposition of college data on this show many times. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=508.56s)]
*  This is only going to cause the conversation to accelerate more. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=513.08s)]
*  Before you get there, you have to understand the line. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  Kids can't be endangered. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  If a kid wants to protest powerfully, the way you protest powerfully is peacefully. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  You mentioned Dr. King and John Lewis Tyrus. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=526.02s)]
*  Dr. King denounced Stokely Carmichael, a comrade in wanting freedom and more opportunity for [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=528.98s)]
*  African Americans and women and others who were, but he said you can't do it that way. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=534.98s)]
*  Dr. King came to my hometown of Memphis and was assassinated. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=539.46s)]
*  People forget he was there a week before and he came back a week later because the week [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=542.9s)]
*  before he came, Jesse, there was violence in the streets. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=546.34s)]
*  And he said, I can't be associated with this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=548.66s)]
*  We have to come back and do it peacefully. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=551.5s)]
*  If you can't teach kids to teach and impart that we do protesting peacefully, any Democrat [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=553.74s)]
*  or Republican, I heard a Democrat say they're applauding people out protesting. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=559.52s)]
*  We applaud peaceful protesting. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=564.16s)]
*  We applaud not threatening other people because they don't look like us because they practice [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=566.52s)]
*  a different religion. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  And to your point, Tyrus, anyone that says they are Hamas, Mayor Adams, the New York [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=572.0600000000001s)]
*  mayor had it right earlier, there's something going on in this city. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=576.84s)]
*  There's a coordination. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=579.04s)]
*  They should all be arrested. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=580.22s)]
*  Yep. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=581.22s)]
*  And if you're wrong, or on the side of being wrong on that issue, as Bill Clinton said, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=582.22s)]
*  be right, be strong and right, then we can wrong. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=585.82s)]
*  It only takes one. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=588.5400000000001s)]
*  It's the only thing that's what you have to do for kids. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=589.5400000000001s)]
*  And if you're arrested and you have a student visa, bye bye. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=592.08s)]
*  I agree. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisbbLuB-WQ&t=595.74s)]
