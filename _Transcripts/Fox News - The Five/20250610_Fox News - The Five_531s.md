# 'The Five': Media goes UNHINGED on Trump over LA riots
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8)
*  Fox News alert, according to multiple reports, ABC News' longtime correspondent, Terry Moran, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=0.0s)]
*  out of a job after posting an anti-Trump social media rant. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=7.0s)]
*  Moran was previously suspended for calling Stephen Miller a world-class hater. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=11.56s)]
*  That comes as the liberal media calls Trump a dictator and a fascist for rolling out the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=16.84s)]
*  National Guard. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  And one guy was comparing ICE agents to slave catchers. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=22.88s)]
*  This reminds me historically of the... it's not a clear analogy, but when the nation, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=28.12s)]
*  when these political factions divided the nation in between, between slaveholders and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=33.68s)]
*  slave catchers. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=39.0s)]
*  Trump is militarizing that state as a test run, as a test run, to make sure that he can [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  do it in places like New York. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=47.6s)]
*  He's decided to throw out all the rules. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=49.28s)]
*  You know exactly what his intentions are. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=50.92s)]
*  He's blonde Berlusconi. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  Oh, while the rancors swear torching waymos is mostly peaceful, CNN's Brian Stelter is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=55.08s)]
*  out here playing the fact check fairy, warning us that riot videos might be misleading because [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=61.2s)]
*  some clips are two days old. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=67.08s)]
*  You got to be careful at a delicate moment like this to look at the time stamps, look [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  at the dates. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=75.08s)]
*  A lot of these algorithms are servicing hours old or even days old content. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=76.08s)]
*  So you might be looking at a video of something, wondering what's happening in LA. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=80.8s)]
*  It's actually from two days ago. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=84.04s)]
*  And that's, you know, it only matters because it can give people a false impression of what's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=86.04s)]
*  actually happening at a moment of unrest. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=90.2s)]
*  Brian Stelter, Greg, explaining the concept of time. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  I will get to him in a minute, but it's always a welcome surprise when I see that pudgy little [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  fella. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  I miss him. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  The media downplays the violence and the mayhem because they support the cause. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=109.0s)]
*  They wax poetic about everything but the victims, as Harold pointed out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  There are victims. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=118.52s)]
*  If this were their house, if this was Stelter's house, he'd be dialing 911 until his fingers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=119.52s)]
*  bleed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=125.36s)]
*  He might even put down a doughnut to call 911. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=126.36s)]
*  What I find interesting is how come these networks aren't interviewing the protesters? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=128.5s)]
*  There's a selective shielding going on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=135.04s)]
*  They know the protesters are the worst spokesmen for the protest. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=136.84s)]
*  So as the media, we'll take care of that for you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=141.44s)]
*  We don't need to interview them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=144.08s)]
*  We will be, I guess, the, your spokesmen. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=145.8s)]
*  And their delusional commentary alongside the videos of the rioters and the arson is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=150.44s)]
*  a perfect juxtaposition of reality and ideology. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, our eyes, we can see the destruction, but their mouths are trying to get into our [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  ears telling us it's mostly peaceful, but there's no better persuasion than the visual. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=164.8s)]
*  Every video strengthens Trump's position and reminds us how wrong the media was on everything [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=170.28s)]
*  from the summer of love to the fall of Biden. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=175.88s)]
*  Little seasonal pun there, but let's get to Stelter and all these other losers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=179.4s)]
*  Do you ever wonder who the media is talking to? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=184.44s)]
*  It's not the public. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=187.46s)]
*  They no longer watch or believe or care what these people have to say. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=188.88s)]
*  The media is talking to the media. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=193.16s)]
*  CNN, MSNBC, they are reduced to being the homeless man muttering to his reflection in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=196.04s)]
*  a CVS window. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=202.0s)]
*  When he nods, so does his reflection. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=203.88s)]
*  But they can't see this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  It's no longer a blind spot. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=207.32s)]
*  It's a complete total eclipse. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=208.6s)]
*  And the bigger, probably the biggest change in culture is the emancipation of the public [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  from the legacy media. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=216.88s)]
*  We are free from these zombies. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=218.48s)]
*  And they have freed us by exposing themselves as ranked partisans, Martha Terry Moran, out [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=221.04s)]
*  at ABC. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=227.44s)]
*  Yeah, you know, with Brian Stelter, I love the fact checking that he's doing there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=228.44s)]
*  I mean, basically the principle would be if you were showing Minnesota and you were saying, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  you know, this is what happened last night in Los Angeles, that's a bad idea, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=238.2s)]
*  If you're showing a continuous protest that has basically been going on since Friday night [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=242.16s)]
*  and you say, well, this was Tuesday, this is today, the story is continuing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=245.76s)]
*  It's the same story. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=250.64s)]
*  So I think it's pretty easy to make that clear. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=251.76s)]
*  It's not like overnight you talked about a fairy, that the fairy godmother came in and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  made everything perfect in Los Angeles, so we shouldn't be talking about it anymore. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=257.64s)]
*  And to Greg's point, you know, it's true that many of these covering this story have become [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=261.08s)]
*  sort of the proxy for the protester. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  And they're saying, here's what's happening here. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=268.76s)]
*  They're not walking up to the man with the flag from Mexico and asking him the obvious [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  question, which is why are you waving a flag from Mexico? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=277.36s)]
*  Aren't you actually angry with the American situation, the government that you find here [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=281.96s)]
*  that you feel is being oppressive to you? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=287.4s)]
*  If you're going to wave a Mexican flag, why not just go back home? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=289.64s)]
*  I mean, imagine if, you know, if thousands of people crossed into Canada and started [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=293.44s)]
*  burning, you know, waving American flags and burning Canadian flags. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=299.48s)]
*  Let's not disclose our military operations, Sandra. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=303.6s)]
*  I mean, they'd be like, go back to America, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=306.68s)]
*  It would be quite obvious. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=309.96s)]
*  But Rachel Maddow never ceases to give us material. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=310.96s)]
*  She said, even if these protests were 100 times the size that they are right now, they [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=314.24s)]
*  still wouldn't have an operational merit to bring in active duty troops or federalized [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=320.44s)]
*  National Guard. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=325.64s)]
*  100 times what you're seeing out there, she says, I would still say it is wrong to bring [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=326.64s)]
*  in the National Guard and to make these streets safe for Los Angeles. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  She has never been she has not been right in so many years. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  She doesn't know what it's like. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=338.6s)]
*  Well, let's go to the lawyer or one of the lawyers, Harold. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=339.6s)]
*  Is he on firm legal ground by activating the guard over the, I guess, reticence of the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=343.6s)]
*  governor? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=351.92s)]
*  You, Kayleigh and I were talking about this during break. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=352.92s)]
*  I think he has the authority to do it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=355.24s)]
*  They're the ground. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=356.8s)]
*  He has grounds to do it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=357.8s)]
*  What I was trying to say in the last in the last segment, and Kayleigh and I were talking [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=358.8s)]
*  about affairs, it would seem to me that with all of the firepower there, if the president [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=362.32s)]
*  is in charge, even Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass don't agree with what the president's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=367.24s)]
*  doing, they have to come together as leaders of the respective city, state and country [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=372.44s)]
*  and say, here's what's going to happen if activity like this finds itself unleashed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=379.44s)]
*  somewhere in our city. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=384.68s)]
*  Here's what we're going to do. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=386.12s)]
*  And if there's disagreement between or amongst the three of them, the president probably [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=387.12s)]
*  supersedes all of them in his authority with the National Guard. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=390.48s)]
*  Now, I don't know what the Marines can do. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=393.12s)]
*  I know what the Marines do, but I don't know what their authority is. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=395.04s)]
*  The president or someone, Secretary Hecht said someone should outline and enumerate [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=398.20000000000005s)]
*  it specifically what their role is there in Los Angeles and what they're able to do as [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=402.76s)]
*  a way. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  Greg and I've had this conversation about Tom Homan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  I think sometimes he talks big a lot and he's like going up for a Clint Eastwood movie all [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  the time. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=415.36s)]
*  And you said, you know what? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=416.36s)]
*  He has to do that sometimes. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=417.36s)]
*  I think it's important for someone to do this here to explain to these rioters, explain [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=418.36s)]
*  to these paid agitators, if you continue doing this, this is what's going to happen because [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=421.76s)]
*  I don't want to watch. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0tKnAK4Os8&t=426.56s)]
