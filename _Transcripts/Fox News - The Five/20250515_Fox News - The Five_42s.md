# Kellyanne Conway on why Kamala Harris lost election #shorts #foxnews #us #news #politics #thefive
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0)
*  Cover-up would be one thing, but they failed to cover what we all saw. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=0.0s)]
*  And but for Fox News, we would never have seen people crossing the border the way we did. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=3.52s)]
*  We would never have seen Joe and heard Joe Biden. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I'm so sick of hearing, had he not run, Kamala would have had more time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=10.48s)]
*  She didn't lose folks because of racism and sexism. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=14.16s)]
*  She lost because of eyesight and hearing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=16.72s)]
*  She had a different kind of cognitive challenge where she never stepped up into that role. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=18.72s)]
*  If you see the president of the United States is not being able to perform, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=23.6s)]
*  if you yourself as his number two don't have confidence in his competence, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=27.52s)]
*  you are duty bound constitutionally and practically and politically [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=31.2s)]
*  to step in and because she didn't work hard, they had no faith in. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XQegvi1kp0&t=35.2s)]
