# ‘The Five’ on the big broken bromance
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU)
*  Looks like we're not getting that big, beautiful truce. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, not yet, at least. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=3.2s)]
*  President Trump telling Bret Baier today [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=4.84s)]
*  that he is not interested in talking to Elon Musk [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=7.0s)]
*  and that, quote, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=10.0s)]
*  Elon's totally lost it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=10.9s)]
*  And like any breakup, he's giving his stuff back. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  President Trump is thinking about selling the Tesla [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=15.48s)]
*  he purchased back when he was trying to help promote [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=18.32s)]
*  Elon Musk's company. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=21.14s)]
*  It has been parked for three months at the White House. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=22.98s)]
*  However, the commander in chief was taking calls [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  this morning just not from Elon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=28.52s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=31.04s)]
*  You call the president on his cell phone at 645, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=32.28s)]
*  he picks up. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=34.18s)]
*  He said Elon wants to talk to him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  He's not ready to talk to Musk, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=36.56s)]
*  who he called a man who has lost his mind. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=38.92s)]
*  Someone who just got off the phone with the president. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=42.32s)]
*  CNN chief political correspondent, Dana Bash, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=44.96s)]
*  joins us now by phone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=47.4s)]
*  Dana, what did he tell you? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=49.4s)]
*  Good morning, John. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=51.84s)]
*  Well, he said that he's, quote, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=53.04s)]
*  well, here's exactly what he said, quote, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=54.94s)]
*  I'm not even thinking about Elon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  He's got a problem. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=59.52s)]
*  The poor guy's got a problem. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=60.7s)]
*  He said he won't be speaking to him for a while, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  but he said he wishes Elon Musk well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=66.56s)]
*  But some Democrats are split on the big, beautiful breakup. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=71.78s)]
*  One lawmaker warming up to the idea [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=75.5s)]
*  of bringing Musk back into the tent. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=78.12s)]
*  But others like ASC were spiking the football. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=80.78s)]
*  Oh man, the girls are fighting, aren't they? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  If Donald Trump is smart, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=87.24s)]
*  the first thing he's gonna do is fire, investigate, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  and prosecute all of Elon's people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=91.32s)]
*  Democrats have to be a big tent party. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=93.82s)]
*  And the way we do that is by bringing in people [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=97.08s)]
*  like Elon Musk and anyone else [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=99.92s)]
*  who would be open to the idea of competent government. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=102.16s)]
*  The Dems, we've been dumping all over Musk [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=105.1s)]
*  and vandalizing Teslas or whatever. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=107.1s)]
*  And now suddenly, now we might be more back into him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=109.5s)]
*  So Jessica, is it okay for Democrats [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=112.9s)]
*  to dust off their Teslas and start driving them again? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=114.96s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=118.8s)]
*  I think it's okay for you to keep doing it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=119.86s)]
*  I did see one on the Merritt Parkway [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=121.74s)]
*  where they had, you know, like the Tesla sign is a T, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=125.14s)]
*  but it said resist. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=127.44s)]
*  So it was like resist on it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=128.94s)]
*  So it was a combination of I don't like you, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=130.24s)]
*  but also this is a peak performance car and I love it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=131.94s)]
*  I personally am a fan of Teslas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=134.72s)]
*  I love how Trump called everyone to say, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=137.02s)]
*  I'm not thinking about Elon Musk. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=139.46s)]
*  I'm not thinking about Elon Musk, like classic. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=141.34s)]
*  You just got dumped. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=143.98s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=145.48s)]
*  All my speed dials like, hey, Brett, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm not thinking about him at all. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=149.56s)]
*  What's going on with you? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=150.72s)]
*  It was, he called, I don't know, something was in my ear. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=152.72s)]
*  Brett called him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=156.82s)]
*  Okay, anyway, Trump wants to talk about it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=157.66s)]
*  He's upset about it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  He's answering the phone. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  But that, he loves, he doesn't sleep and he loves the phone. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=162.7s)]
*  So this all makes sense. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=165.7s)]
*  It's kind of all perfect. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=168.54s)]
*  Do you have his number? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=169.38s)]
*  No, but I'm sure other people at the table could help me out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=170.3s)]
*  Jesse, do you have his number? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=172.3s)]
*  No comment. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=173.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=174.76s)]
*  So this is all fun, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=176.2s)]
*  Like the Real Housewives of the Oval Office [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=177.58s)]
*  and yesterday I was having a great time. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=179.68s)]
*  You know, wonderful meme day. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=182.28s)]
*  Twitter's got its groove back, all of that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=183.66s)]
*  But two things are really important here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=185.82s)]
*  One, we can't take our eye off the prize, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=188.12s)]
*  which is actually the content [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=190.38s)]
*  of what Elon Musk is talking about. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=191.66s)]
*  And that is this big, beautiful bill. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=192.94s)]
*  So he's upset because personally, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=194.72s)]
*  it's an attack on his companies [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=196.74s)]
*  because of getting rid of the energy credits. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=198.26000000000002s)]
*  But he is right about ballooning the deficit. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=200.4s)]
*  He is right about that you don't need those kinds of tax cuts. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=201.96s)]
*  And he's right and others as well, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  that you're gonna be throwing millions of people off [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=207.5s)]
*  with their health insurance. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=209.12s)]
*  The other part of this, and I heard it all the time, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=210.38s)]
*  you know, oh, it's so amazing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=212.66s)]
*  You have a transparent administration back in office [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=214.46s)]
*  and we're respected around the world. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  It is the exact opposite. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=218.62s)]
*  We are the laughing stock of the world. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  Literally, the internet across the globe [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  is making fun of America. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=224.02s)]
*  No, not the internet! [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=225.46s)]
*  Making fun of America. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=228.44s)]
*  I don't think I'm gonna sleep tonight. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not just saying like random, like big balls accounts. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=232.0s)]
*  I'm talking about like Medvedev, all of the Russians, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=235.08s)]
*  everyone in the government. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  He was so raunchy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=238.76s)]
*  Medvedev was tweeting about this? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=239.6s)]
*  Well, if this were reversed, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=241.56s)]
*  you would be making so much fun of... [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=244.24s)]
*  No, it couldn't actually. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=246.76s)]
*  We couldn't possibly be this immature. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=247.6s)]
*  No, it can't be. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=249.16s)]
*  It's impossible to be reversed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=250.0s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=250.84s)]
*  It also has real implications for the way the country... [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=252.16s)]
*  Because you guys don't do anything [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=253.0s)]
*  in front of other people. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=254.68s)]
*  You did five years of a massive deception [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=256.6s)]
*  entirely designed to trick a country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=261.66s)]
*  Look, if this feud we're having in a vacuum, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=265.02000000000004s)]
*  I might feel differently, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=267.24s)]
*  But I will gladly embrace a feud over a fraud. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=269.38s)]
*  This isn't a backroom coverup [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  of a horror show of a presidency. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=275.42s)]
*  It's not a massive deception engineered to trick a country. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=277.70000000000005s)]
*  This is an open quarrel between patriots. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  One who's risking his empire [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=286.38s)]
*  and another who risked his life, both for this country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=288.34s)]
*  And we understand it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=291.46s)]
*  We understand what's going on here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=292.92s)]
*  But the Dems don't. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=295.58s)]
*  Because the idea of fighting over principles, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=297.1s)]
*  honesty, transparency is so alien to them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=299.78s)]
*  They're thinking like, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  dude, why didn't you guys just lie? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=304.06s)]
*  I mean, that's what we do. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=306.08s)]
*  We had an incapacitated president [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  and we pretended he was real. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=309.54s)]
*  Why are you guys fighting? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=311.1s)]
*  Haven't you ever heard of lockstep? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=312.46s)]
*  No, we have Republicans, Libertarians. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=314.82s)]
*  We have a tolerance for risk. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=318.18s)]
*  We're okay with arguments. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=320.46s)]
*  We're even fine with infighting. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=323.26s)]
*  This isn't even that interesting to me. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=325.3s)]
*  It isn't. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=328.12s)]
*  And Musk, to his credit, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=329.28s)]
*  is directing a hell of a lot of attention [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=331.18s)]
*  to something that is existential, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=333.28s)]
*  the economic debt crisis. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=336.14s)]
*  And that's important. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  He's doing everything he can to do that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=338.56s)]
*  And he's mad at Trump for not getting there fast enough. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=340.42s)]
*  But if you were to ask a Democrat who's right, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=343.26s)]
*  most of them wouldn't have an answer [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=345.58s)]
*  because the answer doesn't matter. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=346.82s)]
*  In their world, it doesn't matter. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=348.7s)]
*  This might be ugly, it might be passionate, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=350.82s)]
*  but it's another day in the office for adults. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl83f4vIIU&t=354.21999999999997s)]
