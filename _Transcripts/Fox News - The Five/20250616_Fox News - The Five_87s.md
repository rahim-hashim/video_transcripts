**Fox News - The Five:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU)
*  I don't remember him being for any wars. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=0.0s)]
*  He was outspoken about most of them. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=3.44s)]
*  So I think to say, oh, now he's a neocon is unfair. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=6.28s)]
*  You know, he wouldn't do this unless he thought it had to be done. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  So you kind of have to give him the benefit of the doubt, which you cannot do with Iran. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=16.28s)]
*  Iran is like the T-1000, you know, in the second Terminator movie. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=20.56s)]
*  You knock it down, you knock down its nuclear capabilities, and it reconstitutes itself. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=24.96s)]
*  And so your only hope is that you make the time it takes to reconstitute longer and longer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=29.86s)]
*  You're not kicking the can down the road, you're kicking Tehran down the road. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=35.06s)]
*  And it's like whether or not you want to do it now, you know, you have to weigh the benefits. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=38.82s)]
*  I don't want to sound wishy washy, but you know, it's all about frame of reference. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=45.1s)]
*  You know, Israel has the Holocaust. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=48.54s)]
*  That is their frame of reference. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=51.14s)]
*  This is not going to happen again. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=52.14s)]
*  You know, if Israel was around before, there wouldn't have been a Holocaust. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=54.06s)]
*  But then the other frame of reference is Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=57.98s)]
*  We were promised an end to that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  So somehow you've got to like start fresh with this and try to push the backstory of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=66.34s)]
*  history off on the side. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=73.58s)]
*  I don't know if that's possible, you know, but you know, if you're going to trust somebody, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=74.94s)]
*  I would trust Trump and not Iran. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=81.14s)]
*  That's where I'm at. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9esK9opUaU&t=83.25999999999999s)]
