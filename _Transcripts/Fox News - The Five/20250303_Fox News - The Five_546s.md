# ‘The Five’: Could ‘knucklehead’ Tim Walz make a run in 2028?
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0)
*  The party of flag-burning pro-Hamas lunatics now wants to rebrand themselves as the party of pro-America country music-blasting patriots. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats reportedly held a comeback retreat last month to reconsider the party's dumpster fire messaging and ditch the far left once and for all. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=10.0s)]
*  According to Politico, some of the key takeaways were, quote, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=20.0s)]
*  Embracing patriotism, community, and traditional American imagery, pushing back against far-left staffers, and owning the failures of Democrats in large cities. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=23.0s)]
*  Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel trying to give his party advice on the last one. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=35.0s)]
*  Safe streets, strong schools, stable finances. Focus on those three things and your city's going to be fine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=41.0s)]
*  We've gone through five years where people became way too permissive of a culture. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=47.0s)]
*  They were all, which is why everything's locked up at Walgreens and CVS, and that is a disaster. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=51.0s)]
*  I don't want to hear another word about the bathroom. You better start focusing on the classroom. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=56.0s)]
*  But the party might be in some big trouble if this serial liar is making a comeback. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=61.0s)]
*  Tim Walz says he might run for president in 2028 and saying, quote, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=67.0s)]
*  Well, I had a friend tell me never turned on a job you haven't been offered. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=72.0s)]
*  If I think I could offer something, I would certainly consider that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=77.0s)]
*  All right. I'll start with you, Jessica. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=84.0s)]
*  Tim Walz. Now, he isn't known for his ability to deal with a crisis like Minneapolis. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=89.0s)]
*  And, you know, he isn't like involved in things that Americans support like tampons and boys bathrooms. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=97.0s)]
*  What do you think he could run on? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=103.0s)]
*  Well, I will just put it out here. It's going to be a very crowded field in 2028. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=107.0s)]
*  I doubt that our nominee will be Tim Walz, but he has a record from running for governor twice in Minnesota [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=111.0s)]
*  that a lot of people will be proud of. I think it's the sixth best state in the country to do business. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=117.0s)]
*  And there's nothing on the Democratic Party platform for Minnesota about tampons in the bathroom. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=122.0s)]
*  So I think he would be OK getting up on a debate stage. I'm not sure he would be the choice. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=127.0s)]
*  I just want to mention that everyone got hot and bothered over the weekend because of this memo [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=133.0s)]
*  that came out of a third way meeting, which is a centrist Democratic think tank. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=139.0s)]
*  And the memo basically said, stop saying crazy stuff. Don't alienate people. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=145.0s)]
*  There's no reason for it. And the far left lost their minds over it and says, well, we're not going to work with people [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=151.0s)]
*  who think this way and we didn't get invited and blah, blah, blah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=156.0s)]
*  That is the correct answer to what happened in 2024. People picked folks that were talking to them like normal people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=160.0s)]
*  And you look at the results of the elections, moderate Democrats overperformed by half a point to three and a half points. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=168.0s)]
*  And far left progressives underperformed point three points to five points. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=174.0s)]
*  The Justice Democrats performing the worst out of any cohort on the left. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=178.0s)]
*  So people really need to stop poo pooing the way other sides of the party are thinking about things. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=182.0s)]
*  Just go out, run your race based on the district that you are in. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=188.0s)]
*  All right, Jesse. You know, the party that, you know, believes in what is it? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=192.0s)]
*  What is the reading hour and grammar school to the kids and the transgender and men and women sport? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=198.0s)]
*  Drag Queen story hour. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=204.0s)]
*  Yeah, Drag Queen story hour. I'm sorry. It's not part of my lexicon. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=206.0s)]
*  You know, burned down cities after, you know, George Floyd. All of a sudden they want to be patriotic. How doable is this? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=209.0s)]
*  Yeah, like they're just trying to trick us by sounding like Republicans. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=215.0s)]
*  Put on a flag pin, go to a football game, dumb the words down for the rubes. It's not going to work. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=219.0s)]
*  Being patriotic means you want to gobble up Greenland and you can't fake that type of patriotism. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=225.0s)]
*  No, you know how I know who a phony person is when the World Cup comes around. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=231.0s)]
*  All of a sudden these so-called men get really into sports. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=237.0s)]
*  You see him at the bars on a Saturday with beer and they're yelling all of a sudden. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=241.0s)]
*  Argentina versus France. Calm down, guys. We all know what's going on here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=246.0s)]
*  You're trying to impress people that no one cares about. And that's what's wrong with the Democrats. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=252.0s)]
*  They're always trying to be popular with the wrong crowd, like foreign nations, like the media, like college professors or women. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=257.0s)]
*  And they always end up sounding like these effeminate snobs who hate America. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=264.0s)]
*  And everybody doesn't want to be around people like that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=269.0s)]
*  That's why the blacks and the Hispanics and all of the young men and all of the unions were like, guys, just get away from us. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=272.0s)]
*  And they think they can fix this on TikTok. Like if clicks meant something, then AOC would be their savior. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=279.0s)]
*  No, wrongs onto something. It's about classrooms, not bathrooms. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=286.0s)]
*  If Democrats can focus in on this child safety, child health, child education space and build up from there, they have a real shot. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=290.0s)]
*  You know, one of the one of the segments they lost was obviously the working class, Sandra. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=302.0s)]
*  How do they get them back? Well, you know, letting people actually fly the American flag outside their home and not condemning them for that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=308.0s)]
*  That's a good start. Rahm Emanuel hit on a lot of really important things here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=315.0s)]
*  I mean, as the former mayor of a city that I dearly love, it's a city that is dearly terribly struggling right now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=320.0s)]
*  He really had on something for me when he talked about having to lock up the Walgreens and the CVS store shelves. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=328.0s)]
*  Everyone in this country has one of these stores near them and they've been living through this and they're saying like, what is it? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=333.0s)]
*  What have we come to? Right. And you have to think about what party people associate that happening. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=339.0s)]
*  That's that's letting things happen. That's not holding people accountable. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=344.0s)]
*  That's lacking law and order. And that's what we saw get a whole lot worse over the past four plus years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=347.0s)]
*  So I think he's on to something. I think if you're going to tell people, though, in these big cities that are struggling the most to embrace safe streets, strong schools, stable finances, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=354.0s)]
*  you have to shake up leadership and change things a whole lot before you can start to embrace those things and tout them as a party because things are still a mess out there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=363.0s)]
*  So I think this is all going to take time, but perhaps this is the messaging that Democrats need right now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=371.0s)]
*  And, you know, Greg, they want to copy Joe Rogan and they want to copy Donald Trump and now they want to copy patriotism. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=377.0s)]
*  Any ideas? Well, yeah, they I have to say I agree with everything Jesse said, but I'm going to say it in a smarter way. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=385.0s)]
*  The Dems are acting like Republicans. They're saying act like Republicans. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=395.0s)]
*  The key word is act, not be, but act to your I hate to say to your point. We need to stop that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=398.0s)]
*  We know Trump is real. Everything is in the moment. It's spontaneous. There is no act. He's not acting. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=406.0s)]
*  So this is a group telling the rest of the group to pretend to be something else, which means then disowning everything that you were before. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=412.0s)]
*  Rom Emanuel is on to something three, four years too late. We were talking about the locking up of the drug. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=419.0s)]
*  It's like, wow, is this supposed to blow our minds? Did you notice in Walgreens that toothpaste is locked up? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=425.0s)]
*  Yeah, buddy, we've been talking about it on the five for three years. Where are you been, you ballet dancer? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=431.0s)]
*  Anyway, we know that 2024 was a blowout. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=436.0s)]
*  We didn't know how much because we forgot to factor in the natural attrition of the Trump voter in the last eight years. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=440.0s)]
*  Some of them died. Some of them were too ill to vote. Trump still crushed it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=446.0s)]
*  So that means the contributions by the by the other identity groups were much larger than people give credit for a huge, huge defeat for identity politics. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=450.0s)]
*  So the whole strategy of the Democrats, these demographic boxes has been crushed. They can't do it anymore. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=460.0s)]
*  There's no way out because Trump did it. I mean, he's like, who got him in? It wasn't old white guys. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=469.0s)]
*  You know, the boxes, race, gender, sexual orientation were crushed by one thing, individualism. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=475.0s)]
*  And the Dems developed through identity politics and allergy to individualism because it was a threat to their strategy, which is voting in blocks. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=482.0s)]
*  If you see yourself as your own person, you won't be part of a block. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=490.0s)]
*  Then suddenly you are concerned about the everyday issues that everybody else is concerned about. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=494.0s)]
*  You don't think as a black person, as a Hispanic person. No, you think as a person. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=498.0s)]
*  And that and that gets rid of the ideology, the ideology, which is identity politics is there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=503.0s)]
*  So you don't think about your concerns because your concerns are inferior to the greater goal, which is, of course, the ideology identity politics. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=508.0s)]
*  I never thought of myself as a white person. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=518.0s)]
*  Everybody thinks of you that way. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=522.0s)]
*  Think of yourself as a guy. Yeah, I think I can see that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=524.0s)]
*  Yeah. Up next, Boston's whack job. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=528.0s)]
*  Mayor is doubling down on her praise for a night wheeling lunatic. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0NUOWIZh0&t=531.0s)]
