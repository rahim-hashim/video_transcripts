# ‘The Five’: Trump is the ultimate fighter
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws)
*  A standing ovation for a man who is saving the nation, Jessica. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=0.0s)]
*  The MAGA movement continues to transcend politics with Trump receiving a raucous welcome at [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=4.0s)]
*  the college wrestling championship. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=8.72s)]
*  U.S.A. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=12.0s)]
*  U.S.A. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=15.0s)]
*  Yep, the GOP wrestlers digging Trump being in attendance. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=18.0s)]
*  The place went absolutely nuts. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  The President came walking in, they're chanting USA, USA, USA. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=28.96s)]
*  The President just walking in the arena, the whole place went crazy because wrestling people [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=32.96s)]
*  are working class, middle class people. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=37.32s)]
*  They love the President, they love his athlete's mindset, his winning attitude. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  So he got a great reception. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=43.24s)]
*  But the biggest moment came from Captain America. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=45.56s)]
*  Wyatt Hendrickson, a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, saluting Trump after winning [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  the national championship in a historic upset. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=52.1s)]
*  It truly felt like it was me and my team against the world because situations like that don't [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  turn out where, you know, David takes down Goliath. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, I just think me and my team, we had faith and I went out there and executed [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=64.8s)]
*  the plan and won a national title. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=69.48s)]
*  When we talk about the final boss, like that is my boss of my boss of my boss. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=71.16s)]
*  So, you know, having him be there and support the great sport of wrestling and be able to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=75.92s)]
*  watch me, you know, have a historic moment like that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=80.24s)]
*  I mean, that's something I'll remember for the rest of my life. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=83.52s)]
*  I've always been super patriotic and I have a heart to serve. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  You know, Jesse, Trump seems to go where the good stuff is, you know, it's like something [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  good's happening. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  He shows up there, there's a vibe. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  And I'm trying to figure out, I was sitting around this today, where do the Dems go to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=99.44s)]
*  do something like that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=103.96s)]
*  It's easy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=104.96s)]
*  They go to the WNBA games. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=105.96s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=107.36s)]
*  Or they could just go to March Madness. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=108.36s)]
*  They could go to the men or the women. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=109.36s)]
*  It's so easy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=111.28s)]
*  I can name a ton of events. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=112.52s)]
*  Go to the Kentucky Derby. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=114.32s)]
*  You know, go to a baseball game. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=115.32s)]
*  It's not that complicated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=118.1s)]
*  At this point, Trump's like running out of events to go to, though. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=120.08s)]
*  He's going to go to Ellie and Sophie's volleyball game next week. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=123.24s)]
*  You know he's going to go to the Olympics in four years and he's going to want to light [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=126.88s)]
*  the torch, Jessica. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=131.76s)]
*  He's going to want to hold the torch in LA. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=133.42s)]
*  You're just going to have to face it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=135.28s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=136.84s)]
*  All the homeless are going to be cleared out of LA. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=138.16s)]
*  They're going to be going to a mega prison somewhere. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=140.52s)]
*  Canada is going to be competing with us under the Stars and Stripes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=143.84s)]
*  And I think the Palisades will probably be condos under the Trump banner. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't know why Democrats don't go to games. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  I used to think they just didn't want to go or they didn't know what the game was, but [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=155.72s)]
*  now I figured it out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=159.12s)]
*  There are a lot of women in Congress and women don't usually like sports. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=160.72s)]
*  And I'm stereotyping women here, obviously. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=164.72s)]
*  And the men you guys elect act like women, like Schiff. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=167.72s)]
*  He doesn't want to go see sports. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=171.48s)]
*  So until you guys vote for guys that like sports, you're not going to connect. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=172.8s)]
*  Well said, Jesse. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=178.92s)]
*  Was it? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=179.92s)]
*  A voice of a generation. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=180.92s)]
*  Jessica, I couldn't help but notice two biological men wrestling. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=182.64s)]
*  Not a woman claiming to be a man wrestling a woman. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=188.18s)]
*  Is that why Dems can't watch it and are sickened by the sight of Americans triumphing? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=191.44s)]
*  Is that a word? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=197.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=198.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=199.2s)]
*  Now it is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=200.2s)]
*  Now it is. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=201.2s)]
*  Anyway, the question is there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=202.2s)]
*  Somewhere. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=203.2s)]
*  Somewhere in there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=204.2s)]
*  The answer is the reason there were no biological men or there were no trans people competing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=205.2s)]
*  is there are only 10 trans NCAA athletes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=210.44s)]
*  So it's the smallest little group of people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=213.72s)]
*  But anyway, we've already done this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  You brought it up? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=219.32s)]
*  Why did you bring it up? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=220.32s)]
*  Well, because the facts matter or they used to. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't know about this week. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=223.72s)]
*  Obviously, this is working for him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=226.92s)]
*  And to go back to the David Shore data that we were talking about with Gen Zs, and it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=228.88s)]
*  should be noted as well that Gen Z women are also shifting towards more conservative. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=234.64s)]
*  One of the rationales, which I feel like has been under discussed, is when you look at [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=240.0s)]
*  the parents. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=244.44s)]
*  So as a millennial, you're about with Boomer parents who are one of the most overtly liberal [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=245.6s)]
*  generations, and Gen Xers are much more conservative. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=250.6s)]
*  And so they were probably growing up in a household that had a more conservative influence. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=254.08s)]
*  And they're also totally coming of age during the Trump era, which Obama wasn't really a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  thing for them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=264.16s)]
*  And so they didn't have that hope and change happening. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=265.58000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, Hillary lost and the Biden administration people, it was 91% of people listed the cost [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=267.92s)]
*  of living as their number one issue in the data that David Shore shared. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=273.86s)]
*  And Trump ended up winning on that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=278.0s)]
*  So it all kind of adds up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, maybe in the future, keying cars will be a sport, and then all you Democrats can [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=281.64s)]
*  go and watch it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=285.84s)]
*  Dana, it is funny, the guy's nicknamed Captain America, he wins the championship, it almost [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=287.36s)]
*  feels like this stuff is scripted. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=292.76s)]
*  Well, and that's actually an interesting point. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=294.8s)]
*  I hadn't thought about that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=297.76s)]
*  But when you said earlier, thinking about where Trump goes, he goes where he knows that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=298.76s)]
*  people are going to be, but also where you can have fun. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=303.68s)]
*  And it drives Democrats crazy that he's having a great time and inspiring younger generation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=308.4s)]
*  I mean, that could last a while. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=314.76s)]
*  In this next generation that they were talking about in that data, they will all of them [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=317.32s)]
*  will be voters by the next election. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=322.96s)]
*  And if they vote Republican, if you vote Republican twice or Democrat twice, you likely will do [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=325.64s)]
*  that for the rest of your life unless there's some big realignment. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=330.79999999999995s)]
*  Interesting judge. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=333.96s)]
*  It's also very authentic. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=336.0s)]
*  I don't think, like, when Democrats go to places, they're pretending to be authentic, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=338.12s)]
*  which is the opposite of authentic. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=344.56s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny you should say that, because I couldn't help but think when [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=346.16s)]
*  I saw Donald Trump, you know, being cheered at this NCAA wrestling championship game, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=350.08s)]
*  that, you know, Tim Walsh was the one who said, talk about phony, he said, basically, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=357.28s)]
*  I'm a tough guy and I can kick any of the Trump supporters' asses. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=365.12s)]
*  That's a quote, folks. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=369.76s)]
*  OK? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=371.12s)]
*  And that's just how phony the Democrats have to be to try to be a part of this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=372.12s)]
*  Donald Trump is naturally a sports person. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=376.96s)]
*  He's been going to sporting events since I've known him for almost, what, 38 years now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=380.68s)]
*  This is what he loves, and they know it's authentic and they know it's real. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=386.24s)]
*  And, you know, when this guy Hendrickson, this, what it was, his second lieutenant in the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  Air Force, he wraps himself in the American flag. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=394.88s)]
*  He salutes Donald Trump. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Lnbcjlhws&t=398.2s)]
