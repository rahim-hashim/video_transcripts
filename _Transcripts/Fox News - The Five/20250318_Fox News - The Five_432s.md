# 'PARTY OF PITCHFORKS': Dems revolt after Schumer's vote
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w)
*  Uxhuma running to the ladies of the view as his own party demands his scalp for caving on the vote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican spending bill instead of getting a warm hug Chuck walked straight into a buzzsaw [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=6.16s)]
*  and then he stepped in it. We are friends but I think you caved I think you and nine other [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=12.8s)]
*  Democrats caved I don't think you showed the fight that this party needs right now. I'd say Sonny no [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=19.28s)]
*  one wants to fight more than me and no one fights more than me you got to fight smart you have two [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  choices one bad the other devastating one chops off one of your fingers the other chops off your [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=29.12s)]
*  arm. Your own party saying yes that's to go. Here's what I'm saying I'm the best leader for the Senate [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=35.6s)]
*  you're not going anywhere. We have a we have a great we're moving forward [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=40.4s)]
*  is a different kettle of fish than it used to be and that's why we're fighting them so hard [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=46.64s)]
*  they are controlled by a small group of wealthy greedy people and you know what their attitude is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=51.36s)]
*  I made my money all by myself how dare your government take my money from me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=57.84s)]
*  Okay you know what one of the things that Chuck Schumer tried to say Dana is that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  you know she wants to get rid of him and he's basically saying look you want me [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=74.4s)]
*  she's basically saying to him we want to get rid of you and he's saying if you get rid of me [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=82.48s)]
*  you're not going to get anyone as good as me and I'm smart enough to know what was coming down the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=88.0s)]
*  pike. I think he made the right decision I think he made the wrong communications all week long he [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=92.72s)]
*  led Democrats to believe that he was not going to vote for it and at the last minute he changed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=98.08s)]
*  his mind and it made everybody mad instead of giving them the tough medicine and making them [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=102.48s)]
*  eat their vegetables he was like here I'll just keep feeding you donuts all day long and then they [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=107.28s)]
*  screamed because they were on a sugar high and furious with him they don't have the power to do [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=111.36s)]
*  that and I think that he made a strategic decision that was the right one but even Hakeem Jeffries [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=115.76s)]
*  on the house side he's furious with him now Chuck Schumer cancels his book tour but he still goes [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=120.4s)]
*  on the view because he wants to talk to them again I think they continue to just the communications [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=125.2s)]
*  of it all just kills me I think that he it's not up until 2028 he will probably weather this storm [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=130.32s)]
*  but there are some hard feelings on the Democratic side and it's deeper than usual. Yeah it is deeper [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  but you know the far left when you read this and they talk about the fact that the transgender [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=144.16s)]
*  stuff is crazy but they're afraid to speak out against it so they agree some of their they're [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=149.12s)]
*  now saying this may be their transition to becoming more moderate but you know what are [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=155.28s)]
*  they afraid of? Well of being boycotted socially ostracized being called a bigot that's how they [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=160.0s)]
*  operate see Republicans were more of like a big tent party we're kind of like a family [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  and Democrats are like a prison gang if you're in a prison you're in either the whites you're [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=171.52s)]
*  the blacks you're the Hispanics if you talk to anyone else outside your little group [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=176.8s)]
*  they'll jump you and they'll cut you and I don't know this because I haven't been in prison but [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=182.4s)]
*  I've spoken to a few people like that and the Republicans were just trying to keep the tent big [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  enough to win like there's guys that think Zelinsky's a scam artist and guys that are like [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=192.4s)]
*  whip the flag pin all day we have people that disagree about tariffs and other people who feel [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=196.8s)]
*  differently about that but at the end of the day it's like we're tolerant the Democrats are [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=203.28s)]
*  intolerant we respect different wings like the log cabin wing and the Christian right might not get [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  along but they respect each other just like any wing of the party maybe a country club Republican [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=215.12s)]
*  might not marry his daughter to a hardcore MAGA extremist but they all can have brunch together [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=222.64s)]
*  as long as Trump wins the Democrats if they disagree with you they don't respect you at all [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  they're gonna like boycott your restaurant they're gonna like basically try to kill you [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=235.92s)]
*  and that's no fun because everyone's basically like you know um I kind of agree about boys [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=240.88s)]
*  not being in women's sports too but I'm afraid to say anything who wants to be in a party that's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  not only not fun but you can't be yourself what do you think Jessica I'm myself basically all the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=250.48s)]
*  time and no one has stabbed me or come up behind me in the shower so everything seems okay why would [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=258.56s)]
*  they be in the shower it's prison right and you say that we're like okay are the most I know I [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=264.64s)]
*  block them out too um Chuck Schumer isn't up for reelection for a while and if people think that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=270.96s)]
*  the leadership fight is going to come down to a CR bill that happened in March of the beginning of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=280.24s)]
*  Trump's second term that's doubtful but it is an indication that the Senate minority leader isn't [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=284.88s)]
*  on the same page as the rest of the caucus who wants to fight and push back as much as possible [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  on Trump and Dana's completely correct it was a strategic problem here that there was no [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  communication strategy about what was going on and that you have left some of your most vulnerable [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=300.64s)]
*  members who are up for reelection a lot sooner than this like John Ossoff in Georgia seats that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=305.52s)]
*  we desperately need to keep kind of out on an island by themselves then saying that they're [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=309.92s)]
*  going to vote against this CR I will say though on the woke front everybody is just going to the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  normal place here Gavin Newsom with his podcast what Seth Moulton is talking about and there's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=321.68s)]
*  been no evidence we've had a few special elections that have happened since Trump was elected and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=326.32s)]
*  Democrats have overperformed flipping seats in red districts like in Iowa and people are not out [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=330.72s)]
*  there talking about trans issues they're talking about bread and butter stuff how to deliver for [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=335.76s)]
*  your family the kitchen table Greg is that because they actually believe in that stuff or they just [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  want to win just want to win because let's not forget what Seth Moulton really said about Trump [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=345.92s)]
*  he said he was a racist he called him a threat to our national security and he called him a maniac [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=352.08s)]
*  and now he's trying to say please don't call each other names so yeah you know what change when [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkRDmUyJ5w&t=356.71999999999997s)]
