# ‘The Five’: Dems are blaming Trump for this?
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY)
*  Democrats acting like Joe Biden didn't leave President Trump a slate of crumbling airports [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=0.0s)]
*  and blaming him for the flight mayor rocking Newark. United Airlines is urging people to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=4.32s)]
*  consider avoiding the airport as passengers deal with hundreds of delays and cancellations. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=8.56s)]
*  Chuck thinks it's outrageous. It's outrageous and it's because of Trump and Doge. FAA has been cut, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=13.6s)]
*  employees have been cut, top people have left in exasperation at what Trump is trying to do. If [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=23.04s)]
*  there's any place where Trump chaos, which is so typical of this administration, can really cause [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=29.36s)]
*  loss of life, it's at the FAA. But the duff man is setting the record straight after Joe and company [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=35.36s)]
*  put fixing racist roads over updating our ancient air traffic control system. They have made no [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=41.92s)]
*  investments in the system that we now see having issues in Newark. On top of that they were focused [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=49.28s)]
*  on things like racist roads. They literally spent time concerned about the word cockpit [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=57.36s)]
*  and changing cockpit to flight deck. It's not funny. The whole system needs to be redone. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=64.48s)]
*  Racist roads, my favorite ice cream flavor. Judge, he makes a great point. Mayor Pete, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=71.12s)]
*  can't stop blaming people. He was focused on racist roads. What did Chuck Schumer do? He's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=78.08s)]
*  been in power for, what has he been in office for decades? I think I counted it once. I think I [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=82.64s)]
*  worked with seven presidents. But here's the thing. The Democrats don't get anything done. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=87.6s)]
*  They spend a lot of money, but they don't do anything. Classic example is the money that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=93.2s)]
*  they use for the EV chargers. Remember the billions, whatever, and they got two chargers [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=97.84s)]
*  done in four years. But there was a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and a package actually, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=102.0s)]
*  the largest in history, $5 billion for air traffic control. $1 billion spent on that, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=108.88s)]
*  but only 20% of it was actually used for air traffic control. So what we've got is the GAO, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=116.32s)]
*  the General Accounting Office has been saying for the last two years that it's dangerous, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  it's outdated. They got floppy disks. 51 of 138 systems are unsustainable. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  This is all during the Biden administration. They said they had no plan under oath to modernize [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=136.64s)]
*  the projects for at least another 10 years. And by the way, Doge did not cut air traffic controllers [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=143.52s)]
*  nor critical safety personnel. That's all. You know, Leslie, if you see how they're describing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=150.0s)]
*  air traffic control in the airports, isn't that just kind of like what you'd expect after seeing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=156.24s)]
*  the A block? That that was your president for four years? So wouldn't you have crumbling [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=162.0s)]
*  infrastructure despite all the trillion, the trillion dollar spending bill? No, because when [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  Buttigieg was in charge of the Transportation Department, the Secretary of Transportation, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  he hired 2000 people. Doge has fired. Let's look at, you know, people say, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=177.44s)]
*  when were they hired? Let's look at who they fired, specifically maintenance mechanics, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=182.08s)]
*  specifically aeronautical infrastructure specialists, specifically Doge took people out [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=187.36s)]
*  who are specifically responsible for this type of coordination. They say what happened in Newark, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  we are seeing an increase in problems. And there weren't these problems in the past four years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=201.2s)]
*  Since January, there have been five significant crashes that hasn't been since 2009. So if [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  everything happened in the last four years and nothing happened during the last four years, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=211.6s)]
*  I'm not buying it. Additionally, because it comes down to two things, staffing and equipment. And [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=215.04s)]
*  specifically, they say in Newark, it comes down to one copper wire. Pete Buttigieg specifically [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  wanted the 50 airports in the United States that need to have fiber that need to have internet [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=227.6s)]
*  and not copper. And he wanted those changed. People seem to think that, you know, anybody who is in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=234.24s)]
*  charge of the FAA can just even the president can just, you know, write a check and hand it off. No, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=239.76s)]
*  they can't. We have something called Congress. Those funds have to be approved with and from [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=245.04s)]
*  legislation that has to go through there. So, you know, for this administration right now to blame [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=249.76s)]
*  the former administration, I'm sorry, when it's happening on your watch. And if this were a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=255.2s)]
*  Democrat, I'd say the same thing. When it's happening on your watch, you are responsible. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=259.52s)]
*  The buck stops with you. Stop deflecting blame. Show some solutions, specific solutions so that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  we can all be safe. I flew into JFK last night, three and a half hour delay, but I am here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=270.24s)]
*  Thanks, Obama. You said so the five crashes being the worst. What did you mean by that? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  Since January, there have been five significant incidents. And that's the worst, you said? Since [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  2009, yes. I would like a check on that. Jesse? Well, I won't be providing that check, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  but you are right and you are wrong, Leslie. Let's begin with how wrong you are, though. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=291.52s)]
*  Do you agree with me that Axios is not a Republican publication? I'll just answer for you. The answer [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  is yes. Axios blames Biden. Axios says this is what happened. Axios says they moved the air traffic [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=303.76s)]
*  controllers that were overseeing Newark and put them in Philly. And that's what caused this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=310.16s)]
*  personnel chaos. And they're doing long-time maintenance work on one of the runways. So there's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  one runway in Newark. Right. And I hate to make this about me, but it has to be. Of course. I had [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=319.92s)]
*  a one-hour delay going to DC. When I came back, four-hour delay, had to take the train. I'm flying [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=326.72s)]
*  out west in two and a half weeks from Newark, my home airport. I'm freaking out. So they need to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  fix this. Duffman needs to fix this. That's where you're right, Leslie. We can point fingers all we [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=338.0s)]
*  want. We know it's Biden's problem, but it's Trump's problem now. And this is like, I would [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=343.6s)]
*  treat this like the pandemic. Emergency Powers, Defense Production Act, you just surge everybody [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=349.2s)]
*  there. It's a major airport. People don't care if a Republican, Democrat, if they're five hours late [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=356.4s)]
*  to where they're going, they're going to blame Trump. So he needs to fix this. It has nothing [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=362.24s)]
*  to do with my flight to California in about two and a half weeks. Nothing to do with that. They [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=367.92s)]
*  had similar communication issues in August of last year under the Biden administration. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=372.48s)]
*  I had a similar. I had an hour delay last night. The champagne was flat in my Gulf stream. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=378.08s)]
*  Can I borrow your jet? No. No? No. No. I thought we had something here. No, no, no. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=384.24s)]
*  No. Where am I? Dana? Yes. You were shaking your head a lot. I was writing everything down. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=390.4s)]
*  A couple things. One, I'm talking to somebody who works at FAA. One thing I think we need to clear up. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=397.44s)]
*  So there is a telecommunications issues and a tech problem that has been going on for a long time. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=403.12s)]
*  It needs to be fixed. And I think that just like with Operation Warp Speed, like let's just warp [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=409.44s)]
*  speed this thing. Warp speed it. Get the Doge guys over there to say, here's the technology. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=415.2s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'm so anyway. But choose a better one. Because you have to talk about priorities. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=421.2s)]
*  Did Pete Buttigieg make this a priority? Do you ever was Biden ever talking about this? No. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  No. What were they talking about? Trains were one of the things. The great thing is about Sean Duffy. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  Do you think this guy can manage? They have nine children. He can manage a lot of things. So he's [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=439.35999999999996s)]
*  going to be able to do that. I'm going to say something that hasn't been said yet, because [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  that would be providing some new ground. We have started privatizing space travel. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=448.96s)]
*  I think that the private market could do a better job here. And you could try this with a few [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  airports, like make them smaller ones, and then grow it out. And you could figure out a way to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  have better retention for people with better salaries that were more competitive that they're [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=464.08s)]
*  not capped out on a government salary. The East Coast is way oversaturated. But we also want to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=467.52s)]
*  grow. We want an abundant country. We want to be able to travel for work and pleasure. And so I [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=473.67999999999995s)]
*  we have to rethink things and think big, which this administration can do. That's a great point. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=479.04s)]
*  Flying is the only experience that progress has left behind. If you think about everything around [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  us, the speed of the technology everywhere, everything's faster except flying. You're [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=488.56s)]
*  probably right. Probably. Maybe. I don't know. I lost interest. And you know, in 2017, Trump tried [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  to, he had a plan to privatize the air traffic control system. One day. Good idea. All right. Up [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  next, manhunt underway after a migrant youth gang beat up cops. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Uln5KL7oY&t=506.0s)]
