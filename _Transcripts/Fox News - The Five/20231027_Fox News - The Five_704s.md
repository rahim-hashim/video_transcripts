# What is the endgame for Israel?
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA)
*  Welcome back. Israeli forces are on the ground in Gaza right now. The IDF has been hammering Gaza for hours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=0.0s)]
*  And a key adviser to Prime Minister Netanyahu. And they're not going to stop until Hamas is eliminated. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=7.0s)]
*  Hamas is feeling now Israel's might. They will continue to be on the receiving end of our military blows [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=14.0s)]
*  until we have dismantled their military machine and dissolved their political structure in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=22.0s)]
*  When this is over, Gaza will be very different. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=29.0s)]
*  Mike Tobin is in southern Israel with an update. Mike? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=33.0s)]
*  Well Jesse, the sky here continues to rumble and pop as airstrikes go into the Gaza Strip and the artillery is firing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=38.0s)]
*  in support of the troops that are on the ground in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=46.0s)]
*  Now for the past three nights we have seen Israeli incursions into the land of the Gaza Strip, land around the Gaza Strip, but they come out. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=50.0s)]
*  What we are seeing tonight, at least as described by Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, is an expansion of the ground incursions we have seen to this point. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=58.0s)]
*  We know that some of the armor has rolled into Gaza and we've got reports that Hamas fighters have made contact with some of that armor that has gone in by contact. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=67.0s)]
*  I mean they're trying to fight the Israeli forces as they're advancing into the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=77.0s)]
*  As far as conditions in Gaza, what the information I'm getting is that the whole of Gaza City was subject to airstrikes today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=82.0s)]
*  The power is out mostly because of the loss of fuel and the internet service and cell services have gone out in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=89.0s)]
*  There's one guy I'm keeping in contact with because he's got an American phone and apparently it's pinging off an Israeli tower. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=96.0s)]
*  But communication is very difficult. The World Food Program says they've lost contact with their staff [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=102.0s)]
*  and that really is the situation. We're waiting to see how things sort out tonight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=109.0s)]
*  But again, if people who are watching, all of us who are watching, are anticipating a full-throated invasion of the Gaza Strip, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=115.0s)]
*  and what we're hearing from the IDF is this is not that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=122.0s)]
*  But as we've heard from the Assistant to Advisor to the Prime Minister, that this is the start of Hamas getting payback for what they did on October 7th. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=126.0s)]
*  Jesse? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=136.0s)]
*  Thanks Mike. Stay safe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=137.0s)]
*  The increased operation comes as U.S. fighter jets carry out airstrikes against Iranian link sites in Syria, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=139.0s)]
*  following more than a dozen drone and rocket attacks against American forces there and in Iraq. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=145.0s)]
*  We're just learning of a 20th attack on U.S. troops in the Middle East since October 17th. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=151.0s)]
*  And the Pentagon says they're ready to strike those terror groups again. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=157.0s)]
*  We'll see. We'll see if Iran gets the message. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=162.0s)]
*  But as we've done in the past, we certainly reserve the right to take additional strikes [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=165.0s)]
*  and continue to ensure that the message is loud and clear, that we will protect our forces, and that these kinds of attacks are unacceptable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=170.0s)]
*  These strikes were very much done in self-defense. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=178.0s)]
*  As you know, our forces and facilities had come under a range of attacks, rocket attacks largely by these proxy groups that are backed by Iran in Iraq and in Syria. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=181.0s)]
*  All right, Will, before we get to the Israeli ground incursion in a second. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=191.0s)]
*  So we struck a few targets, and that didn't apparently get the message through. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=195.0s)]
*  We're getting return fire. What does that tell you? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=201.0s)]
*  It tells you that these Iranian-backed terrorist groups are not that concerned about the reaction of the United States. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=204.0s)]
*  Now, I will tell you that I feel for the administration or anybody trying to thread this needle in that, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=210.0s)]
*  how do you avoid a world war and then how do you back the bully down? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=217.0s)]
*  And that's a tough needle to thread. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=222.0s)]
*  But you have to only do the only answer I think we've ever learned throughout history is that you have to respond with strength. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=224.0s)]
*  And I think you can accomplish both goals, hopefully without provoking an overwhelming regional war and one that spills over to us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=229.0s)]
*  But while backing down these minor attacks against Americans, which deserve a response and a response of strength. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=236.0s)]
*  And this new incursion into northern Gaza, to me it looks like a shaping operation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=243.0s)]
*  You know, you go in, you probe, you see what the Hamas reaction is, what the tactics are, what the intelligence tells you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=250.0s)]
*  And then that kind of leads you to the next step into a formal ground invasion. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=257.0s)]
*  How do you interpret what's going on? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=262.0s)]
*  Well, we were talking about this a little bit earlier. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=264.0s)]
*  Trey Yanks laid out for us the Israeli army's main goals here as they prepare for this ground invasion. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=266.0s)]
*  The top two goals of which were one, destroy Hamas, two, recover hostages. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=271.0s)]
*  And I was just in the process of saying, I think those two goals are very hard to accomplish together. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=276.0s)]
*  David Belavia earned the Medal of Honor on my show, the Will Kane podcast, was describing urban warfare, infantry. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=280.0s)]
*  He won, he earned, excuse me, he earned the Medal of Honor for Fallujah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=287.0s)]
*  And he talks about studying Berlin and studying Graz. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=291.0s)]
*  And he said the bottom line is when you send the infantry in, it's no longer a scalpel operation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=294.0s)]
*  Now, there may be special forces out there that are capable of bringing back hostages. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=299.0s)]
*  But once you send in the infantry, once you roll in, it's about taking out the enemy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=302.0s)]
*  It's a brute lethal force. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=307.0s)]
*  Anything else in there is a secondary goal. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=309.0s)]
*  And it's going to be a methodical operation that could take months. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=312.0s)]
*  We're hearing Sandra. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=315.0s)]
*  General Kellogg made that prediction on our air earlier when I asked him to predict just that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=316.0s)]
*  The rear Admiral Daniel Haggari, we all saw him on camera earlier. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=321.0s)]
*  He was talking, the army spokesman. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=325.0s)]
*  He said that these aerial attacks have been targeting Hamas tunnels and other targets. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=327.0s)]
*  In addition to the attacks we carried out in recent days, he said, ground forces are expanding their activity right now. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=331.0s)]
*  The IDF is acting with great force, he detailed, to achieve the objectives of this war. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=338.0s)]
*  I think we have to start to ask ourselves what the end game is and what victory is and what that will look like. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=343.0s)]
*  Israel said its plan is to crush Hamas's rule in Gaza and its ability to threaten Israel. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=350.0s)]
*  We know that is clear. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=355.0s)]
*  But how Hamas's defeat will be measured and the invasion's end game, I think, Jesse, you can make the case remains unclear at this hour. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=356.0s)]
*  So as those days, hours, days and weeks go on, that is going to be a bigger and bigger question. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=367.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's as we said, it is surgical from the air. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=372.0s)]
*  But once you get in there and you have tunnels, we actually got a report that they're throwing in the bunker busters. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=376.0s)]
*  So this is going to be a gnarly scene in a couple weeks. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=383.0s)]
*  Could be. I think Will is, everybody I agree with, I think Will's point about trying to balance and understand how do you thread the needle here when you have to do two things. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=385.0s)]
*  First, you have to destroy Hamas's capabilities. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=394.0s)]
*  I think, Sandra, your point about how does that look, what is the definition of that? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=397.0s)]
*  And I think the Israelis are going to define that because they're the ones that have to live with the consequence or the answer to that question. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=401.0s)]
*  And my hunch is I'm 53 years old, I served in Congress 27 years ago. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=407.0s)]
*  I didn't think we would see this moment, but I sense a resolute and determination on the part of the Israelis to never have a generation of Israelis have to deal with this again on their borders. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=412.0s)]
*  I think they will answer that question decisively. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=421.0s)]
*  I think the second part, to Will's point about how do you balance this and thread the needle, is how do we keep our Arab allies where there's massive conversation and coordination to the extent there can be right now on our side? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=424.0s)]
*  Because I think those allies, including European allies, but particularly those in the Arab region, we have to keep them as aligned with us as possible as we respond to some of these attacks and as we get proactive about attacking to ensure that they're not able to attack our troops and our assets. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=436.0s)]
*  One thing is clear. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=451.0s)]
*  We talked a few weeks ago on this show, we talked about how the president may not have been mentioning the Iranians by name. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=453.0s)]
*  They know dog gone well that he knows who they are, where they are. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=458.0s)]
*  And we have the greatest not only intelligence service, but military on the ground, more assets than we've ever had in that region in my lifetime since war, since wartime. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=461.0s)]
*  And we're going to have even more come next week. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=470.0s)]
*  So I give them the benefit of the doubt on this more than perhaps some might. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=472.0s)]
*  But I got to tell you, if we don't respond with force, as Will said, this will continue. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=477.0s)]
*  And I think you've said it each night on your show as well. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=482.0s)]
*  So I got blessed the president and got blessed our troops as they go about exercising and litigating the toughest thing that I've seen in my lifetime. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=484.0s)]
*  Judge, did you find these counter strikes by the U.S. military to be a little too tentative, perhaps a little too late? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=492.0s)]
*  Well, I think that we heard this past week that they were waiting for the missile defense systems to get over those particular countries. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=499.0s)]
*  I think it was Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, you know, so that we at least were in a position to defend our troops. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=507.0s)]
*  Now, I've heard now that there have been 20 attacks on our air on our troops, but we don't know yet how many troops have been injured. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=514.0s)]
*  They haven't told us that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=522.0s)]
*  And it took them a long time to tell us that we there were 13 attacks. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=524.0s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, I disagree with one thing that Harold said. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=527.0s)]
*  You know, we don't have the best intelligence. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=530.0s)]
*  Our intelligence failed us on this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=532.0s)]
*  We have 33 Americans who were killed. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=534.0s)]
*  We've got at least 13 over there that are in the tunnels right now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=536.0s)]
*  And let me say one thing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=540.0s)]
*  This is war. War is ugly. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=541.0s)]
*  Jesse, you use the word gnarly. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=544.0s)]
*  The truth is Hamas headquarters are located under a hospital and you're not supposed to attack a hospital unless they're using the enemy uses a hospital to protect itself. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=546.0s)]
*  And it can't do that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=560.0s)]
*  And the question of proportionality must be consistent with the military goals and a legitimate target. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=561.0s)]
*  The owners right now is on Hamas. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=568.0s)]
*  Hamas, by putting their Pentagon under a hospital, has just committed a war crime. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=570.0s)]
*  And there is no question they spent two years preparing this. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=577.0s)]
*  They have been working with landlines so nobody could access the information they had. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=581.0s)]
*  It's only with human intelligence and human sourcing that we know where these tunnels are. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=587.0s)]
*  There are over 400 miles of tunnels underground. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=592.0s)]
*  We have no idea where our Americans are. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=595.0s)]
*  And so what we've got to do is recognize that there will be harm, that there will be damage, and that the only time Israel will stop, and this is their war, is when they get rid of Hamas. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=599.0s)]
*  And I think Bibi just stated in Israel that tonight is the turning point. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=611.0s)]
*  Tonight is the war. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=616.0s)]
*  Tonight is when they take down Hamas. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=618.0s)]
*  And unless we join them in making sure that this happens in a way where this kind of thing never happens again, then we're going to be subjected to these kinds of attacks as well. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=620.0s)]
*  Let me just respond one second. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=632.0s)]
*  When I said, Judge, when I said about our intelligence, all they have to do is be right one time, and they were right one time. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=633.0s)]
*  There were things that were ignored, at least some of the press reports were saying there were things that we and the Israelis ignored or didn't take as serious as we should have over the last several weeks. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=638.0s)]
*  I think that our intelligence is the best in the world. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=646.0s)]
*  Yeah, but we didn't catch this. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=648.0s)]
*  Of course we didn't. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=650.0s)]
*  Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this conversation. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=651.0s)]
*  My only point is they have to only be right once, and they were right once. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=653.0s)]
*  They were right this time. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=656.0s)]
*  But Judge, I'm an American, and I believe when our forces and our intelligence says that they are on the ground and are focused on this the way that we believe they are, whether we agree with their politics or not, I think that's the way we should be. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=658.0s)]
*  I know you agree with me, but I just don't. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=668.0s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=669.0s)]
*  I'm agreeing too that when we've got American forces on the ground, it's the best. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=670.0s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=674.0s)]
*  What are you differing with? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=675.0s)]
*  They missed this. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=676.0s)]
*  Well, you differ with me. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=677.0s)]
*  MI6 missed it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=678.0s)]
*  Mossad missed it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=680.0s)]
*  Shin Bet missed it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=681.0s)]
*  Everybody missed this. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=683.0s)]
*  They had signs and they ignored those signs, and I don't believe they'll ignore these signs. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=684.0s)]
*  We're going to agree that we agree. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=688.0s)]
*  One more thing's up next. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=689.0s)]
*  If you're going to be able to get the most complex interviews and most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSrghx5gRA&t=698.0s)]
