# Joey Jones: This is about pacifying Americans who are saying 'Really?'
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s)
*  And Joey Jones is on the phone with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi, Joey. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=2.52s)]
*  Hey, guys, how's it going? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=4.04s)]
*  Let's get your take. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=6.32s)]
*  We'll give you the floor. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=7.48s)]
*  Yeah, listen, if this were about to turn, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=9.4s)]
*  it would have happened a couple of months ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=11.0s)]
*  At least 150-some-odd strikes against the United States ago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=12.8s)]
*  This is about pacifying Americans who are literally [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=16.84s)]
*  sitting here going, really? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=19.12s)]
*  We're going to let someone hit us 200 times [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=20.6s)]
*  and kill three of us now and injure dozens of us? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=22.56s)]
*  And we're just going to say that you don't? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=26.12s)]
*  That's our best policy here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  I hate to believe that presidential politics [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=31.24s)]
*  has anything to do with keeping Americans safe. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=33.64s)]
*  And I heard the judge talk about that earlier on the show, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=36.36s)]
*  that doing anything now may potentially affect oil prices [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=38.36s)]
*  and then escalate into a worse economic situation at home. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=42.84s)]
*  Well, why is that? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=46.04s)]
*  What policy has led to that? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=47.36s)]
*  The truth is, Jordan's watching. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is watching. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=50.68s)]
*  Israel, for a matter of fact, is watching. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=52.28s)]
*  And I don't know that any of those countries, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=54.92s)]
*  that we want to be an ally, that we want to be on our side, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=56.64s)]
*  if something were to break out, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=59.88s)]
*  are being inspired by the United States right now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=61.4s)]
*  But what is happening is that a lot of Americans [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=64.28s)]
*  are sitting here going, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=66.2s)]
*  I don't think my son or daughter [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=67.4s)]
*  needs to serve in this military. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=68.56s)]
*  And I'm for whatever changes our perspective [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=70.36s)]
*  on our government's ability to keep us safe, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=73.8s)]
*  regardless of who the president is. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=76.4s)]
*  That's not even a hit against President Biden [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=77.92s)]
*  as much as it is an observation of where we are as a country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=80.28s)]
*  Three Georgians were just welcomed home in caskets. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=83.0s)]
*  And I can imagine their families [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=87.08s)]
*  are sitting there going, yes, retribution. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=88.24s)]
*  They're probably sitting there going, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=90.96s)]
*  I hope whatever happens today and tomorrow and the next day [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=92.44s)]
*  stops the next three families from mourning [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=95.44s)]
*  three more Americans that were somewhere we didn't, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=97.88s)]
*  most Americans didn't even know they were, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=100.8s)]
*  doing something that most Americans [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=102.56s)]
*  aren't aware that they're doing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=103.92s)]
*  Good point. Judge? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=105.52s)]
*  Joey, you know, one of the things [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=106.88s)]
*  that General Kellogg said a few minutes ago, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=108.32s)]
*  he said Iran does not want to go to war [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=110.52s)]
*  with the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=113.24s)]
*  And yet we all know that we can spend all kinds of efforts [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=115.08s)]
*  going after the proxies, but Iran is in charge. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  And Iran trying to deny the connection is absurd. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=121.8s)]
*  They supply, they train, and they pay them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Why is Iran pushing us [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=127.84s)]
*  if they're afraid to go to war with us? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=131.64s)]
*  Do they have, are they close to a nuclear weapon? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=133.68s)]
*  This is what I believe. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=138.0s)]
*  I believe Iran got what they wanted already. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=138.92s)]
*  I mean, immediately after three Americans were killed, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  there's a dispute between the United States and Jordan [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  as to where this happened, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=146.6s)]
*  because they don't want this mess on their doorstep. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  Look at what's happening in Israel. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=151.44s)]
*  I mean, look at the fact that America is having [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=153.27999999999997s)]
*  to excuse itself or answer for every single thing it does [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=155.64s)]
*  in the Middle East right now, among its own people, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  with a presidential election coming up. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=161.88s)]
*  I think for Iran, that's enough. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=163.92s)]
*  They don't need to go to war with us [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=165.48s)]
*  to show their neighbors that we may not be as strong [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=167.44s)]
*  as we say we are, that we may not have as strong [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=170.52s)]
*  of a voice within our country as we say we do. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=172.72s)]
*  And I think that's the goal for them, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  is the doubt among countries that might align with the US [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=178.0s)]
*  or Israel moving forward. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=182.2s)]
*  And I think that is where they're winning right now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=184.16s)]
*  I don't wanna go to war with Iran. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=186.52s)]
*  I'm not Lindsey Graham. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=188.0s)]
*  Listen, I spent eight years fighting two wars over there, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=188.96s)]
*  and I know less about it today [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=192.12s)]
*  than I did when I was 18, I think. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=193.4s)]
*  So it's not that I want us to go to war with Iran. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=195.28s)]
*  I want a president and an administration [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=199.0s)]
*  that is so decisive and so well-planned [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=200.76s)]
*  that before our own dead make it home, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=203.28s)]
*  we've settled the score and deterred them [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=205.96s)]
*  from doing it again. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=207.6s)]
*  Or, and this is a lot to ask for, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=208.8s)]
*  so decisive and so strategic that we never have folks die [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=211.88s)]
*  because there were never 170 attacks [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=215.44s)]
*  that happened to begin with. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=217.8s)]
*  Can I ask you then what you think about the decision [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=219.08s)]
*  on the timing of telegraphing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  that there was going to be a response for several days [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  and that the IRGC pulled all of its leadership [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=230.68s)]
*  out of Syria yesterday? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=233.44000000000003s)]
*  I think that President Biden truly believes, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=235.8s)]
*  and this is not a hit against him, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  but I truly believe that President Biden's administration, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  their strategy from the beginning, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=242.44000000000003s)]
*  and they're sticking to it, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  is they can buy and talk their way out [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=245.44000000000003s)]
*  of a potential crisis or war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  And to date, those things have only made me feel less secure [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=250.72s)]
*  and made those friends of mine serving in the military [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  feel less supported. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=257.12s)]
*  So I believe that that is a part of their strategy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=258.64s)]
*  We're going to show a force, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=261.0s)]
*  but we're not going to hurt you so bad [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=262.64s)]
*  that you feel the need to retaliate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=264.92s)]
*  I don't know that President Trump ever had those concerns, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=267.08s)]
*  and I felt much better about it back then. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  Hey, Joey, you're in Georgia. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=272.92s)]
*  I spend my weeks in Texas. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=274.56s)]
*  We come from a similar background. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=275.88s)]
*  You, of course, have made great sacrifice for this country [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=277.44s)]
*  on the battlefield. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=280.4s)]
*  I'm curious, when you bring in your personal experience, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  Joey, and everyone that you know, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  Brett brought up the polling shows [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=287.28s)]
*  America has no appetite for another war. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  You hear individuals like the generals suggesting [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  that strikes are warranted in Iran. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  Wars don't happen overnight. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=298.67999999999995s)]
*  They kind of metastasize from a bunch of small decisions. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  You end up in a war. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=303.76s)]
*  We don't launch wars anymore. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  We certainly don't declare wars anymore. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=306.52s)]
*  Remember when the last time we had [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=309.4s)]
*  a congressional declaration of war? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=310.28s)]
*  Do you think there's a case for any leader right now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=312.52s)]
*  to be made that convinces the American public [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  that we should be messing around with war with Iran? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=316.28s)]
*  You know, my biggest concern is that I was a part [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  of a 20-year war that ended so desperately [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=322.2s)]
*  that the American people, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if they don't have an appetite for war [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  as much as they don't trust their government [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=329.64s)]
*  to take them into a war, no matter how just it may appear [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=332.4s)]
*  or how necessary the cause may be. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=335.79999999999995s)]
*  That's what's scary. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=337.88s)]
*  When the American people who ultimately have to spend [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=340.08s)]
*  the money and shed the blood no longer trust [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=341.44s)]
*  their government to send their sons and daughters [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=343.8s)]
*  or themselves to war, it's not about, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=346.04s)]
*  we don't have an appetite for war. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=348.8s)]
*  If something like 9-11 happened today, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=351.16s)]
*  we would have all the appetite in the world [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=353.32s)]
*  to go seek retribution and prevent it from happening. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=355.48s)]
*  But our faith in the system we have, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=358.12s)]
*  and really that faith is broken down [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  at every level all along the way, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=362.68s)]
*  from the taxes we pay to the borders we have [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=364.16s)]
*  to the words we use. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=366.72s)]
*  And that is the industry of politics [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=369.76s)]
*  making its way into the minds and hearts of us [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=371.44s)]
*  to the point that we don't trust our government [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=374.76s)]
*  for our security anymore. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=376.48s)]
*  And that's the biggest concern I have [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=378.24s)]
*  because that leads to recruiting woes, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=379.96s)]
*  that leads to defense spending woes, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=382.44s)]
*  that leads to the Lindsey Grahams and Tom Cottons [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=384.28s)]
*  calling for what may be the best strategy, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=387.16s)]
*  but every one of them sitting here going, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=389.48s)]
*  that's a war hawk, that's someone [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=391.28s)]
*  that just wants to drop bombs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=392.68s)]
*  Because that's what we've seen for 20 years, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=394.12s)]
*  that's what they've shown us for 20 years. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=395.8s)]
*  I lost my legs in a war that Lindsey Graham would say, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=398.2s)]
*  and I'm not beating up on him, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=401.32s)]
*  he's the most honest and vocal advocate for his position, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  but he would say, I lost my legs [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=405.56s)]
*  because he told me just sitting on the couch [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=407.88s)]
*  on Fox and Friends, and my jaw kind of dropped, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=409.4s)]
*  that I lost my legs because we did the right thing [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=412.12s)]
*  by fighting the war over there and it didn't come here. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=415.52s)]
*  But you know what, that's an easy thing to say [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=418.28s)]
*  when you can't show me the intelligence brief, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  when you can't do a 50 minutes piece [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=421.52s)]
*  or a bear piece that shows those connections by fact. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=423.64s)]
*  That we're told to just believe that, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=429.12s)]
*  that we're told to just believe [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  that we get to be the press secretary at that moment, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  or to get to be the president at that moment. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=433.76000000000005s)]
*  And I think the American appetite for believing [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=435.6s)]
*  the fact, as the government tells you, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  has gone out the window with the age of information [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=441.32000000000005s)]
*  and some of the bigger voices in politics right now, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=443.76000000000005s)]
*  of political commentary. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=446.36s)]
*  Wonderfully said. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=448.98s)]
*  Greg, did you have anything from Joey? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  No, so it's good to hear him, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=452.12s)]
*  because literally he's the expert in my mind. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=453.36s)]
*  I just think, I mean, I just, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=457.72s)]
*  punishment, and Joey, you can tell me to shut up, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=458.96s)]
*  but punishment for me is always, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=463.64s)]
*  you put somebody in a hole that they wouldn't be in [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=465.68s)]
*  if they haven't committed the infraction. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=467.68s)]
*  These things always seem to me as incredibly performative, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=470.2s)]
*  not as a deterrent, but just to say we did something. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=473.6s)]
*  Because the bad guys end up back at the starting block, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=477.0s)]
*  where they just start back up. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=480.32s)]
*  You know, here's the deal, Greg. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=482.74s)]
*  We spent 20 years taking out strategic target [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=485.08s)]
*  after strategic target, strategic person after strategic [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=488.26s)]
*  person, asset after asset of our enemies, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  and they never lost the ability to harm us [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  at about the same rate. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=497.2s)]
*  So it's hard for me to believe that these bombings today [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=498.76s)]
*  reduce the ability for our enemies in the region [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=501.7s)]
*  to attack us, and that's what's concerning, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=504.64s)]
*  because if you're not sending the right signal, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=506.74s)]
*  which I don't believe this is a signal [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=509.0s)]
*  sending to anyone but the American people, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=510.4s)]
*  at least there's something effective [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=512.52s)]
*  that stops their ability to harm us. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=514.2s)]
*  And I don't have the experience that would lead me [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=516.24s)]
*  to believe that's what's happened today. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=518.88s)]
*  Joey Jones, thank you. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiaDsTvs7s&t=521.4000000000001s)]
