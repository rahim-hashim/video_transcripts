# Judge Jeanine: 'The Squad' is complicit with Hamas
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY)
*  The squat Democrats are agitating again over Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=0.0s)]
*  The radical lawmakers had a big week of calling for ceasefires and spreading [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=4.92s)]
*  Hamas propaganda that blamed the Jewish state for the Gaza hospital explosion. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Today they were backing back at a rally, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=14.08s)]
*  backing Hamas on the national mall and bashing Joe Biden. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=16.28s)]
*  Calling on Congress for more bombs and more weapons, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  which we know will only lead to more violence and more death and more atrocity and absolutely not. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=26.52s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=36.44s)]
*  Most America is not with you Mr. President. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=38.6s)]
*  Most of America is not with the people that don't want to de-escalate and facilitate a ceasefire. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  But you're obviously not talking to these Americans. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  How many more killings is enough for you? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=55.32s)]
*  Is it a thousand more? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=58.52s)]
*  Two thousand more? Three thousand more? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=60.2s)]
*  How many more Palestinians would make you happy if they die? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=62.04s)]
*  Anilhan Omar getting grilled by Hilary Vaughan over why she's been calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=66.44s)]
*  You called for a ceasefire, are you okay with Hamas terrorists continuing to exist? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=73.4s)]
*  Do you think that Israel should just lay down their arms and not try to get the hostages out of Gaza? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=79.88s)]
*  How can Israel have a ceasefire with terrorists whose entire mission is to wipe out their enemies? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=85.72s)]
*  You're blocking the elevator please. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  How can they have a ceasefire if they're trying to wipe out this crazy lady? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=94.44s)]
*  Don't worry about this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=98.36s)]
*  So Jessica, the old saying is that Israel ceases and whatever terrorist group of the day just keeps firing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=100.6s)]
*  You see that Hamas has not stopped firing rockets. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=108.76s)]
*  We now have them coming in from the north from Lebanon into Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=111.48s)]
*  So they're calling for a ceasefire when the people who started this whole thing aren't even putting their arms down. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=116.04s)]
*  Right, it was a very quick moment of silence on their behalf for the massacre and then within 24 hours or so it was moved to this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  And like I just said, if you're not leading your argument or whatever, however you're speaking about this, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=131.32s)]
*  with who committed this atrocity, who started this, this isn't about litigating settlements in the West Bank or going back to 1967 lines. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=137.64s)]
*  It's terrorism. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=148.44s)]
*  And it's really interesting to see. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=150.6s)]
*  So this ceasefire proposal out of Congress had 13 signatories. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  And then you look to the leaders of these movements, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders people very far in the progressive left, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=158.2s)]
*  who are not touching it with a 10-foot pole. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=165.32s)]
*  They want to make sure that humanitarian aid gets into Gaza and a lot of more mainstream Democrats believe in that as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=167.32s)]
*  They're not calling for a ceasefire. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=173.64s)]
*  No one showed up on September 12th and told us, why don't you guys all get back in bed, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  We don't have to talk about what happens next. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  There are good people on both sides of it, blah, blah, blah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  It's infuriating. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=185.16s)]
*  I'm not democratic leadership. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=186.6s)]
*  Honestly, I don't think it's about some sort of dereliction of duty when they say, I don't want to talk about it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  I think they're just annoyed and like this is such a sideshow from what's going on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=192.52s)]
*  Biden speaks for us. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=197.24s)]
*  This is not worth our time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=199.0s)]
*  So, Jesse, you can argue that a series of ceasefires over the past two decades have led to what happened on October 7th. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  This idea that you can do a ceasefire, which is not a treaty or a peace agreement, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=210.36s)]
*  and you can just manage this terrorist group that says they want to kill all the Jews on the planet. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=215.0s)]
*  But really, they don't mean it that much. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=219.4s)]
*  Yeah, a ceasefire is not an effective terror strategy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=221.48s)]
*  And it might sound good to the peacenik wing or the anti-Semitic wing, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  but you can't win the war on terror with ceasefires. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=231.88s)]
*  And they know that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=235.72s)]
*  They're just appealing to the fringe. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=237.0s)]
*  And they took direct threats at their president. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=239.48s)]
*  They said that they're not going to vote for the top of the ticket. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=243.48s)]
*  They named swing states. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=247.0s)]
*  They named Pennsylvania. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  They named Georgia. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  They named Michigan. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=250.84s)]
*  You say it's a sideshow. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  This is a loud sideshow. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=253.72s)]
*  And this sideshow could have legs, Jessica. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=255.88s)]
*  These are people that are appealing to a younger demographic that have been brought out of the woodwork. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=258.68s)]
*  You've seen the crowds. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  These are not small gatherings. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=265.88s)]
*  This was not a small gathering. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=267.96s)]
*  The ones Johnny's is gathering downtown right now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=269.72s)]
*  You're underestimating the visceral hatred that they're tapping into here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=273.4s)]
*  And Omar seems angry at Jewish people more than she's angry at Hamas. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=279.16s)]
*  And they have to understand that Hamas brought the suffering upon the Palestinian people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=285.56s)]
*  The Jewish people did not. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=290.36s)]
*  So this is going to be a big problem for Joe Biden electorally, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  and it's going to be a big problem for the Democrats in terms of their brand. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=295.0s)]
*  So, Greg, I think we need some, a douse of Joan Rivers' response to this type of thing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  when they call for a ceasefire. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's sad because, you know, Omar, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=305.8s)]
*  what happened to loving your brother? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=308.36s)]
*  You know, at this point, why are we covering them? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  I will go, Jessica is partly right in that they hold no sway over the party, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=314.44s)]
*  but they do hold sway over us, you know, because they're interesting. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  They, you know, they drive your emotions. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  But I think, you know, why are we giving these wrongheaded nutcakes the oxygen? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  Let them fill in the hours at MSNBC. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=330.12s)]
*  The squad is now their only viewers and soon to be hosts. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=332.6s)]
*  In fact, if I were MSNBC, I would hire, I think there are five now, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=335.96s)]
*  I think there are five in the squad. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=340.52s)]
*  There's one dude. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=341.88s)]
*  They're perfect. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  Call it the squad, have it at 5 p.m., and the motto is, it's the five without brains. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=344.12s)]
*  Because it's another problem with this moment-by-moment coverage, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  is having to comment on the vomit that comes out of their mouths. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=352.76s)]
*  Maybe we pull back from these chuckleheads, too. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=356.2s)]
*  We got enough hate bubbling up from Hamas and the streets filled with sympathizers. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=358.44s)]
*  These freaks have bounced themselves from normal conversation. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=363.0s)]
*  They don't deserve our time, as you said. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=366.12s)]
*  But we do, to your point, Jesse. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=368.36s)]
*  We do need to look at our culture. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=371.48s)]
*  We need to step back and realize that this isn't really about their influence on the party. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=374.6s)]
*  It's about their influence on a younger generation [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=379.24s)]
*  who have lost the ability to love this country, maybe never did. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=381.72s)]
*  Jessica, Greg said you were right twice this show, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=386.92s)]
*  so I just wanted to write that down for the record. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=388.84s)]
*  I think my mom actually had a heart attack. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=390.6s)]
*  I'm not going to put a life alert on. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=393.24s)]
*  I'll let you know if there are any more. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=394.68s)]
*  Judge, just to go back to the smear that the squad has continued to perpetuate, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=396.28s)]
*  that the Israelis targeted deliberately a hospital in Gaza [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=400.28s)]
*  when it was one of their own rockets from Islamic Jihad. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=404.2s)]
*  Hamas is firing rockets every single day at hospitals in Israel, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=407.16s)]
*  and nobody's freaking out about that being a war crime. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=410.68s)]
*  The thing about this that is very disturbing, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=414.92s)]
*  and should be disturbing to everyone who's got at least half a brain, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=418.04s)]
*  is that it is already the idea that Israel flew the rocket or the missile into that hospital [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=422.12s)]
*  has been debunked. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=429.64s)]
*  I mean, we've got visual, we've got audio, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=430.84s)]
*  we've got communications between Hamas leaders. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=433.48s)]
*  It clearly was not Israel. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=437.24s)]
*  And the squad calling for a ceasefire and continually railing against Israel, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=439.32s)]
*  to me, makes them complicit with Hamas. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=446.52s)]
*  Israel has the right to defend herself. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=450.04s)]
*  Israel was attacked. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvtABpu-yY&t=453.48s)]
