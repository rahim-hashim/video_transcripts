# Jesse Watters: We've had it with the Middle East
**Fox News - The Five:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk)
*  The media finding new ways to defend and excuse a surge in anti-Semitism. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas sympathizing ghouls have been ripping down posters of innocent Israelis being held [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=5.0s)]
*  hostage. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=10.4s)]
*  But the New York Times wants you to consider the feelings of the vandals. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=11.6s)]
*  Quote, removing the posters has quickly emerged as its own form of protest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=15.32s)]
*  A release valve and also a provocation by those anguished by what they say was the Israeli [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=21.52s)]
*  government's mistreatment of Palestinians in the years before October 7th and since [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=26.96s)]
*  the bombing of Gaza began. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm going to throw up. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=33.8s)]
*  Another outlet actually claims that the posters could be a trap and are baiting people into [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=35.88s)]
*  getting filmed and doxxed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=40.4s)]
*  And with garbage like that floating around, it probably won't be long until the left-wing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  press finds a way to normalize the Cornell student who threatened to kill any Jewish [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  student he saw on campus. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=50.64s)]
*  The feds arresting 21-year-old Patrick Dye for making online threats. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=53.06s)]
*  And he was in federal court to face the charges, which could land him in jail for up to five [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=57.540000000000006s)]
*  years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=61.86s)]
*  The White House getting asked point blank if stuff like that is domestic terrorism. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=62.86s)]
*  The people in this country making violent anti-Semitic threats, are they domestic terrorists? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=67.7s)]
*  I don't know that we're classifying people as domestic terrorists for that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=74.38s)]
*  That's really a question better left to law enforcement. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=81.66s)]
*  I'm not aware that there's been such a characterization of that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=84.3s)]
*  Terrible question. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=89.58s)]
*  Of course, you're not a domestic terrorist if you're not a white guy in a red hat. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=90.58s)]
*  That's the rule. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=94.82s)]
*  Dana, my theory on why they're defending these people that are tearing down the posters is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=96.3s)]
*  because the truth of the posters is too hard to bear. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  And it blows your filter of oppression versus oppressor filter right out of the water. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=107.78s)]
*  It shatters your ego if you're on the other side. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=113.58s)]
*  So I think what they're saying is, it's just too hard to look at. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  So get rid of it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  It's so hateful. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  They walked by so many other things that they could tear down, but they don't. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=125.7s)]
*  They decided to tear down the pictures of children. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=128.78s)]
*  And earlier today or yesterday, I did an interview of Martha McCallum on her own podcast because [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=131.38s)]
*  she last week was at the Israeli consulate and she was part of a small group of journalists [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=136.94s)]
*  who was shown the 45 minutes of the Hamas GoPro videos and the other videos that were [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  put out. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=147.46s)]
*  OK, so it's her podcast is called The Untold Story. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=148.46s)]
*  It posted today. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=151.64s)]
*  It's definitely something that we should all listen to. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=152.98s)]
*  She watched it and other journalists have watched it on our behalf. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=155.9s)]
*  They're the witness. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=158.14s)]
*  And she is shaken up by it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=159.7s)]
*  Of course she is. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=160.9s)]
*  And what is shocking is that how quickly you could go from being horrified by what happened [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=161.9s)]
*  on October 7th to tearing down posters and you think that's OK. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=166.1s)]
*  And let me tell you about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=169.46s)]
*  Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib get this anti-Semitic label. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=172.46s)]
*  But AOC is giving them a real run for their money. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=178.45999999999998s)]
*  Today she went after AIPAC. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, she has all of these incidents happening in her very own city and she doesn't [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=183.06s)]
*  say a word. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=188.14s)]
*  Remember when there was crimes against women in the city or Asian-Americans? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=189.74s)]
*  She says nothing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=193.1s)]
*  But she will defend them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=194.74s)]
*  No, she doesn't. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=195.9s)]
*  She doesn't do anything for women in her constituency. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=196.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  Jesse, there's another reason I think that they're defending these people is that they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  got exposed. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=205.9s)]
*  They're being filmed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=207.34s)]
*  So now if they could get away with it, it would make a big deal. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  But now the media has to defend them because they could get in trouble. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=211.3s)]
*  I want to say something about Arab-Americans and about the Muslim world. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=215.86s)]
*  I'm not going to hold your hand, even though I should, Dana. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=220.46s)]
*  When I say we, I mean the West and Western technology have created the Middle East. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=225.34s)]
*  We made them rich. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=232.78s)]
*  We got that oil out of the ground. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=234.94s)]
*  Our military protects all of these oil shipments, flying around the world, making them rich. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=236.78s)]
*  We fund their military. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=243.02s)]
*  We respect their kings. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=244.38s)]
*  We kill their terrorists. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=245.8s)]
*  Okay? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=247.3s)]
*  But we've had it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=248.3s)]
*  We've had it with them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=250.22s)]
*  Obama, Trump. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=252.18s)]
*  Now Biden have tried to get the heck out of that stupid desert. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=254.22s)]
*  Just as we're about to get out, because we have this great balance of power we're arranging, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=258.3s)]
*  these crazy Muslim fanatics come in and massacre over a thousand of our allies and hold Jewish [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=262.54s)]
*  people hostage, hold Americans hostage. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=270.74s)]
*  And so if you're an Arab-American in this country and you rip down posters of Jewish [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=274.58s)]
*  hostages, of American hostages, no. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=281.18s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=284.82s)]
*  Someone is going to get punched in the face. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=289.1s)]
*  When you rip down posters of hostages like that, this is absolutely not. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=291.82s)]
*  And the New York Times, the second sentence, Greg, that I thought was even worse, whose [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  suffering should command public attention and sympathy? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=302.1s)]
*  So what they've done is they've now made suffering a commodity. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=306.62s)]
*  They've now put a price tag on emotional suffering. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=310.5s)]
*  Is it the Jews? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=315.17999999999995s)]
*  Is it black teens? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=316.82s)]
*  The Native Americans? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=318.34s)]
*  The Palestinians? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=319.61999999999995s)]
*  You know, who's suffered the most? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=320.61999999999995s)]
*  And he who's suffered the most is allowed, as you say, a free punch. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  And so now they've justified violence to avenge suffering. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=327.14s)]
*  And so now people are above the law, people are below the law, and that's making everybody [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  crazy because we can't live in a country like that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  And I won't live in a country like that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you imagine, I mean, like I was just thinking about this, that you can burn the American [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  flag and generally people just dismiss you as a nut. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=345.38s)]
*  God forbid you burned a Palestinian flag. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  Oh, God forbid. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=351.1s)]
*  Yeah, you would be, I think you would be arrested. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=352.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=354.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=355.06s)]
*  Not that I'm advocating that, of course. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=356.06s)]
*  I'm against burning anything except my burning love for Harold Ford. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=357.06s)]
*  How are you? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=361.82000000000005s)]
*  Good to be back. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=362.82000000000005s)]
*  How great is it to be back around the table? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=363.82000000000005s)]
*  It's tremendous to be back. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=365.26000000000005s)]
*  I've been watching every day and I'm glad to be able to contribute, put my voice as [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=366.42s)]
*  a part of this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=369.94s)]
*  I don't necessarily disagree with what Jesse has said, but I think both parties and every [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=370.94s)]
*  organization and company has its share of fools and haters and bigots. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=376.06s)]
*  And we're seeing a lot of that on display now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=381.02s)]
*  I think sometimes when we try to have serious conversations, particularly in politics, really [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=383.09999999999997s)]
*  anywhere, it gets reduced sometimes to, I'll be simplistic, the progressives or MAGA, when [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=387.82s)]
*  things are far more complicated, political issues, I think, and more nuanced in many [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=395.22s)]
*  ways and deserve more inspection. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=398.86s)]
*  Two, I'm always amazed in the last two weeks as I hear people in my party, the Republican [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=401.06s)]
*  parties, I hear people on college campuses or elsewhere, serious people seemingly, say [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=406.98s)]
*  that they want to cease fire or some sort of pause. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=411.7s)]
*  But not before or at any time saying they wish that Hamas would give back the hostages. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  You can't have a pause or a ceasefire until the hostages are given back. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=420.5s)]
*  You can't even take people like that seriously, let alone credibly, if they're not willing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=426.26s)]
*  to talk about those kinds of things. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=430.06s)]
*  Two, the Israeli-Saudi normalization, which we're on path to getting, we have to remember [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=432.1s)]
*  a huge part of that, as all of us know, was a two-state solution, something that would [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=437.42s)]
*  give the Palestinians predictability, stability, a chance and an ability to raise their kids [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=442.54s)]
*  with the kind of security that we all wish for our kids. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  And this has derailed that in the worst of ways. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  End on this point, which I don't mean to be political on, but I do think we have to acknowledge [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  that in politics, as Kellyanne and I both know and all of us know, and Dana knows perhaps [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=459.44s)]
*  more than any, having worked in the White House along with Kellyanne, that you can't [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=463.96000000000004s)]
*  let the perfect be the enemy of the good. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=467.20000000000005s)]
*  Senators McConnell, Graham, President Biden, they agree on something that is fundamental [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=470.16s)]
*  to where we sit right now. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=475.16s)]
*  Let's fund Ukraine, Israel. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=477.02s)]
*  Let's fund the southern border efforts and let's fund our efforts in Taiwan. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=479.7s)]
*  It may not be the perfect bill. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=483.18s)]
*  It may not be the perfect proposal, but we can't wait three to four weeks to get this [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=484.62s)]
*  done. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=489.21999999999997s)]
*  So I would hope that those who want to solve this, want to be a part of the solution, be [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=490.21999999999997s)]
*  a part of the solution and stop being a part of hindering things. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=494.02s)]
*  That's on college campuses and in our Congress. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  That solution, though, of grouping things together is always just infuriating to me. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=501.06s)]
*  You're not infuriating to me. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=505.62s)]
*  You never will be. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=507.14s)]
*  But this, the idea of having to put these things all together. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=508.14s)]
*  What do you think, Kellyanne? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=510.62s)]
*  Well, House Republicans are pushing back on that. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=511.62s)]
*  It's a big question back in their districts. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=513.22s)]
*  People don't want all those funds commingled. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=515.0s)]
*  They don't want to think of this as one big thing. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=516.98s)]
*  But I want to get back to the Chiron role, looking at liberal media defend people ripping [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=518.98s)]
*  down hostage posters. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=523.3s)]
*  People should know that President Biden said, well, I don't really have confidence in Hamas [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=526.86s)]
*  numbers and the Washington Post fact checker, Glenn Kessler, said, you know, Hamas has a [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=531.62s)]
*  pretty good track record at revealing death tolls, defending them yet again. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=535.54s)]
*  The New York Times calling this a release valve. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=540.3399999999999s)]
*  If you're ripping down posters of Israeli hostages, which you correctly point out must [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=542.62s)]
*  be returned, it's a release valve. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=547.78s)]
*  They're not jogging, boxing or having a shot of tequila. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=550.14s)]
*  I mean, so even these subtle phrases that somehow pass an editor or to his desk that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=552.5799999999999s)]
*  are somehow reporting facts to the rest of us. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  And I would like to point out in 2021, he did it the first time, but in 2023 at Howard [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=560.4599999999999s)]
*  University, President Joe Biden said that white supremacy is the most dangerous thing [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=564.3s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=571.3s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=572.4599999999999s)]
*  You can't even get John Kirby to say that this is domestic terrorism, people who are [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=573.6999999999999s)]
*  ripping down posters. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=578.02s)]
*  And I have to say what's going on right now, the calls for ceasefires, the pro Hamas sympathies, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=579.78s)]
*  that's not just young people on college campuses. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=585.78s)]
*  That's Democrats in the halls of Congress. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=589.02s)]
*  18 of them just last Thursday signed a resolution calling for the, quote, immediate deescalation [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=590.86s)]
*  and ceasefire in Israel and, quote, occupied Palestine. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=597.74s)]
*  So if you've got 18 Democrats, all of whom are Hispanic and African-American, exactly [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=601.98s)]
*  the kinds of folks that Joe Biden is going to rely upon to help him win again. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=607.04s)]
*  And they are raging ahead. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  The New York Times had a whole article that said young and diverse left rages at Biden. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=614.3000000000001s)]
*  So this is a big problem for the party. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=619.66s)]
*  I appreciate you trying to make it bipartisan. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=621.38s)]
*  I don't think anybody should, I think there should be no question. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=623.66s)]
*  Everybody should condemn me what AOC said today. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=628.42s)]
*  APAC is a terrorist organization calling for violence. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=630.34s)]
*  It's like one of the most bipartisan organizations in D.C. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=633.74s)]
*  That's who goes on trips with them. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=635.74s)]
*  And in D.C., yes, they take everyone over there. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=636.74s)]
*  Maybe you've gone. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=638.7s)]
*  I haven't. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=639.7s)]
*  We all need to know that somehow the media, weeks later, Greg, still can't get this right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=640.7s)]
*  They can't figure out. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=644.58s)]
*  And I think that mainstream media is edging toward immoral clarity on all of this. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=646.02s)]
*  Yeah, and you're seeing Jews now in New York protecting the posters. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=651.22s)]
*  How soon will New York Times call them instigators? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWCj2OVybk&t=654.98s)]
