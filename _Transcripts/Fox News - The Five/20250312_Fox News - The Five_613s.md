# ‘The Five’: Another federal agency gets hit with ‘DOGE-Zempic’
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc)
*  The Department of Education getting a dose of dozempic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=0.0s)]
*  The agency slimming down its workforce by half, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=4.04s)]
*  giving 1,300 career employees the boot. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=6.76s)]
*  Trump's handing the chalk back to the states. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=9.52s)]
*  We have a dream. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  And you know what the dream is? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  We're going to move the Department of Education, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=15.24s)]
*  we're going to move education into the states [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=17.28s)]
*  so that the states, instead of bureaucrats, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=20.32s)]
*  work in Washington so that the states can run education. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Where the parents of the children [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  will be running education. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=28.72s)]
*  Where governors that are doing a very good job [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=30.28s)]
*  will be running education. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=32.68s)]
*  But Democrats are crying foul [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=35.12s)]
*  as they watch their beloved cash cow [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=36.68s)]
*  for union jobs get butchered. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=38.68s)]
*  The one that squandered a trillion bucks [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=40.84s)]
*  and left a trail of kids with nothing but crummy test scores. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=42.84s)]
*  Of course, the teachers union boss is furious. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=46.2s)]
*  The federal government does not control education. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=49.84s)]
*  The states do. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=52.36s)]
*  Local school boards do. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=53.64s)]
*  This is about opportunity. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=55.32s)]
*  That is why so many people are so mad about it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=56.68s)]
*  because they're just taking opportunity away [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=60.16s)]
*  from kids that don't have it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=62.56s)]
*  So, billionaires, kids of billionaires, they have it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=64.0s)]
*  They go to private schools. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=66.96s)]
*  Everyone else, 90%, go to public schools. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=68.36s)]
*  Don't take away their opportunity. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=72.0s)]
*  Sue, let's stay on the facts. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=74.28s)]
*  Sorry, I'm really angry about this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=75.52s)]
*  No, because this is what keeps me- [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=77.84s)]
*  I'm really angry. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=78.68s)]
*  All right, Judge, how, at this point, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=81.2s)]
*  can you defend the state of public education in America? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=83.36s)]
*  The progression has been downward [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=88.24s)]
*  since we got to the point [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=91.0s)]
*  where the federal government got involved. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=92.64s)]
*  And make no mistake, the Constitution does not grant [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=94.84s)]
*  the federal government authority over the schools. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=98.52s)]
*  And the 10th Amendment also says specifically [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=101.6s)]
*  that powers not delegated to the federal government, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=105.44s)]
*  as in education, is up to the states. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=108.84s)]
*  All right, so let's get that legal piece out of the way. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  Then what you do is you say, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=116.36s)]
*  kids are getting worse every year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=118.2s)]
*  39% of fourth graders are not proficient in math, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  31% not proficient in reading. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=124.76s)]
*  Eighth grade, 28%, can't do math. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=127.08s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy, or can do math. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=129.72s)]
*  So, in the end, they're gonna argue that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=131.76s)]
*  this isn't fair to the kids. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=135.12s)]
*  This money does not go to teachers. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=136.72s)]
*  This is about grants and programs [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=139.0s)]
*  and monitoring those grants and sending money out [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=142.0s)]
*  to their favorite educational project. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=145.0s)]
*  And it's got nothing to do. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=148.08s)]
*  And for this woman to fight for students, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=149.2s)]
*  the woman who had the opportunity to open schools [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=152.92s)]
*  when they got billions to COVID-proof our schools [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=156.4s)]
*  and couldn't find one metric, one reason to open the schools, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=158.84s)]
*  and now she's got the unmitigated goal to say, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=162.32s)]
*  oh, our students, you could care less. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=164.32s)]
*  Go back to Ukraine and do whatever you do in Ukraine, Randy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=166.8s)]
*  Dan, have you heard an idea from Randy, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=170.24s)]
*  besides spend more money, any idea at all to improve scores? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=172.88s)]
*  Well, no, and the other thing is, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't hear them concerned about it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=179.88s)]
*  No. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=182.12s)]
*  They're concerned about the Department of Education [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=182.96s)]
*  being cut, but as we've pointed out, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  and they've started to point out, they're like, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=188.44s)]
*  but wait, local governments already do that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=189.84s)]
*  Okay, well then fine. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=192.28s)]
*  Then what's happening at the Department of Education? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  Why doesn't anybody care? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=195.56s)]
*  There are some things that they do, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=197.0s)]
*  and the Linda McMahon, the secretary said, would continue. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=198.6s)]
*  For example, it's possible you could take [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=201.44s)]
*  the Pell Grant program, which a lot of people like, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=203.6s)]
*  and say that helps lower income students go to college. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=206.36s)]
*  Why isn't that at the Treasury Department? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  You can take the student loan program, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=212.88s)]
*  which has got problems, you could take that over [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=215.72s)]
*  to the Treasury or the Commerce Department. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=217.8s)]
*  There are things that can be done to deal with that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  They also are complaining that it's the Justice Department, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=221.4s)]
*  excuse me, the Education Department [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=224.72s)]
*  that defends disabled students. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=226.0s)]
*  You could do that at the Justice Department, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  so all of those things are possible. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=230.64s)]
*  Our public school system used to be the envy of the world, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=232.55999999999997s)]
*  and now we are a laughing stock in the world, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=235.04s)]
*  and President Trump is saying we can't allow that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna add one other statistics [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=239.72s)]
*  that you guys might not have seen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  Jason Riley today in the Wall Street Journal reports [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=243.32s)]
*  that since COVID, well before COVID, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  chronic absenteeism, which means missing 10% or more [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  of school, was at like 28%. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  Now it's at 34%. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=255.04s)]
*  So over a third of the students in New York, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=257.0s)]
*  don't go to school 10% or more, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=260.2s)]
*  and you think that your kids aren't gonna pay for that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  for the rest of their lives? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely, we all will. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=265.4s)]
*  But I would say if the Democrats really want to save [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=267.2s)]
*  the Department of Education, don't put Randy on TV, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  take her on, go after them and say, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  you are not doing what is the fundamental right [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=276.12s)]
*  of every person in this country, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  which is to get the education that they deserve. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=280.24s)]
*  Why do you think people are pouring across the border [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  with their kids? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=284.2s)]
*  Because they get the constitutional right [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=285.08s)]
*  to be educated here. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  But even that is not gonna be good enough [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=287.8s)]
*  for the fate that awaits us if we don't change. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=289.52s)]
*  If they did take on Randy and the unions, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=292.44s)]
*  they might not get donations though. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Maybe that's what they're afraid of. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=296.68s)]
*  Who is Randy? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=298.32s)]
*  Weingarten. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=299.44s)]
*  Where? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=300.8s)]
*  Lady. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=301.64s)]
*  Oh, I thought that was a fat Gary Shandling. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  RIP, Gary's not really alive. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=305.56s)]
*  It goes back to just politics in general. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=309.12s)]
*  How much real estate does politics take up in your life? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  It should only be like one room [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=313.84s)]
*  in your giant house of stuff. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=315.4s)]
*  But the Dems have injected politics [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=318.2s)]
*  in every single room in your house of life, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=319.88s)]
*  including education. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=322.2s)]
*  You're supposed to be able to make the decisions [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  and protect your kids from stuff in school. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=326.4s)]
*  Instead, they said no school choice. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=329.32s)]
*  You can choose your abortion, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=331.2s)]
*  but you can't choose your own school. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  You can't do anything about your kids [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=334.0s)]
*  if they're being groomed by perverted teachers. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  If you go to a school board meeting, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  they'll come after you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=340.55999999999995s)]
*  This is why Doge works, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=341.76s)]
*  because it has none of these phony tropes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=343.16s)]
*  It's presented as is. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=345.72s)]
*  Here's the program, here's the cost, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  here's what it does, here's what it doesn't do. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=349.6s)]
*  It's impossible to protest unless, of course, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  the protesters are paid, Harold. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  But we can spot it now. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=356.72s)]
*  You can't trick us anymore. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  You can't take our money [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=360.24s)]
*  and not give us something in return. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=362.0s)]
*  So I think Americans like this stuff [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=364.56s)]
*  because they respond to clarity. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=366.76000000000005s)]
*  And the Democrats are having a problem [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=369.88s)]
*  because they've never had to sound out their ideas [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=371.6s)]
*  because the media never expected that from them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=375.04s)]
*  So they just agreed with them. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=377.16s)]
*  So what you're seeing and what you saw this woman melt down [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=378.76000000000005s)]
*  is their ability to provide any coherent defense [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=382.36s)]
*  has atrophied. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=387.76000000000005s)]
*  And that's what you saw right there, a screaming Mimi. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=389.56s)]
*  Well, usually you'll be able to point to results [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  and say, well, we did this, we did this. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  They can't even do that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=397.36s)]
*  Harold, do you still really want to quadruple the size [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  of the Department of Education? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=402.56s)]
*  I do, and I'll tell you why. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=403.4s)]
*  So hear me out, because you all have said a bunch of things [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=404.52s)]
*  and some of them, there's a lot of passion [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=407.04s)]
*  behind what you're saying, but a lot of it's just not true. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=408.56s)]
*  Here comes the bite. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=410.68s)]
*  So let me give you a sense, give you a guess. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=411.52s)]
*  What percentage of money do you believe [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=414.04s)]
*  in our public school system on average in every state [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=416.16s)]
*  is spent by the federal government, Judge? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=419.0s)]
*  What percent of it? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=421.04s)]
*  So I'll give you, 7.8% in public education, K through 12, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=422.0s)]
*  comes from the federal government. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=427.32s)]
*  The state, on average, is 46.8, local governments are 45.3. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=428.4s)]
*  Local and state governments establish [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=433.52s)]
*  academic goals in schools, they adopt and approve budgets, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  they approve expenditures, they set the school calendar, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=438.52s)]
*  they hire and supervise the superintendent, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=441.12s)]
*  and they approve hiring of all personnel, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=443.2s)]
*  including teachers. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=445.0s)]
*  So then why do we need a Department of Education? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=445.84s)]
*  Because what the 7.8% does, Judge, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  some of it's higher ed stuff, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=451.0s)]
*  and some of it is feeding poor kids lunch. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=452.2s)]
*  Let me finish, you asked me. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=455.2s)]
*  No, no, no, no, that comes from other. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  You're wrong, you're wrong. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=458.04s)]
*  Let me just finish my point, you're wrong. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=458.88s)]
*  That comes from the Department of Agriculture [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=459.72s)]
*  to breakfast, lunch comes from there. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=460.88s)]
*  They also help school districts deal with kids [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=462.48s)]
*  who have disabilities, mental and physical. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  I know these numbers are uncomfortable. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=466.92s)]
*  I'm for what you are for, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=468.44s)]
*  which is helping our schools get better. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=469.56s)]
*  But what you're saying doesn't make any sense [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=471.36s)]
*  because all the decisions are made at the local level. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=473.8s)]
*  The reason I think the fed should have more of a role, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=475.92s)]
*  Greg, if I'm wrong, I'll be the first to say, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=478.24s)]
*  if we do it and the fed screw it up, so be it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  The reason all those things you talk about, Dana, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  so well when you had that person on DP last week, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  and I made the comment about Louisiana, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  their schools really suck, so their reading went up. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=489.12s)]
*  That's great, but they were at such a low level. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=491.56s)]
*  These decisions are being made at the local level. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=494.12s)]
*  The money comes from the local level. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=497.64s)]
*  The only point I make, you can differ with me [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=500.08s)]
*  and say the feds may do a worse job, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=502.04s)]
*  but I know this, the people in charge now, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=503.92s)]
*  our students are getting a raw deal [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=506.12s)]
*  because of what we have set up right now. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=509.72s)]
*  I'm not saying the federal government will do it [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=511.56s)]
*  much better, but I know this, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=513.52s)]
*  they can't do it any worse than what we're doing right now. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  That's why I made the point I made last week. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=517.8s)]
*  It's interesting to me that we have the same goal, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=519.64s)]
*  and we have the complete opposite way of getting there. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=521.52s)]
*  I actually appreciate your point of view [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=525.64s)]
*  that it should be bigger, that you could do more [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=526.9599999999999s)]
*  and they deserve more, but then I also see my point of view, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=529.4s)]
*  which is it's not doing what it needs to be doing, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=533.16s)]
*  so therefore why not push it back the other way? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  But Dana, it already is that way. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=539.64s)]
*  94% of it is there. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm saying, if all these other things can be done [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=542.16s)]
*  at other departments, then maybe this department [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=545.76s)]
*  is not gonna be doing it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=547.48s)]
*  Because I believe, you don't, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=548.32s)]
*  Department of Treasury, we could divide their stuff up. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=549.1600000000001s)]
*  We could divide the Department of Defense up. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  This is a national concern and challenge [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=552.44s)]
*  and purpose and function, I believe, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=555.5600000000001s)]
*  much like defense is. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=557.2800000000001s)]
*  So we could, they have to have local partners to do it, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=558.36s)]
*  but the federal government ought to be involved [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=561.12s)]
*  in making sure kids can read where they live [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  in Louisiana, California, New York, Tennessee, Georgia, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  or New Jersey, wherever it may be. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=567.48s)]
*  But education flourished for most of our history [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=568.32s)]
*  without the Department of Education [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=571.88s)]
*  that you and I both know was created by Jimmy Carter [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=573.84s)]
*  as to say thank you to the teachers union. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=577.64s)]
*  So let's be straight about why that was. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=580.44s)]
*  Harold, Harold, we have a lot of tariffs to talk about. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=582.32s)]
*  Jesse, in 1980, the Nation at Risk study came out. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=585.6s)]
*  They had to have years of study before that [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=588.76s)]
*  to get the data. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=590.84s)]
*  Harold, a two-word solution for all of this, child labor. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  I got him. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=597.36s)]

*  You always encapsulate it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eroBkyL9mYc&t=601.4000000000001s)]
