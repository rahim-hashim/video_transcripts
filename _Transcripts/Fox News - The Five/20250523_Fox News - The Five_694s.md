# ‘The Five’: Trump cracks down on campus radicals
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA)
*  All right, let's talk about the shooting in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=0.0s)]
*  This poor young woman, we are now learning, Sarah Milgram, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  crawling away, Paul, trying to drag herself, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=7.88s)]
*  you know, away from the gunman as best she could [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=12.56s)]
*  while he continued and continued to just unload on her. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=14.56s)]
*  In full, I mean, in public, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=18.6s)]
*  On the sidewalk in front of dozens of other people. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=20.96s)]
*  Yeah, so horrible optic. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=23.88s)]
*  Let's advance the story a little bit here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=25.04s)]
*  First of all, he travels cross-country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=27.04s)]
*  He seems to be engaged in a targeted shooting, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=28.88s)]
*  It's very Mangione-esque, okay? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=31.36s)]
*  Shoots them in the back. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=33.88s)]
*  Seems to have done maybe some social engineering [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=35.04s)]
*  because according to the person that put the event together, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=37.04s)]
*  the whole thing was done under real strict security. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=39.84s)]
*  In fact, even the invitations were sent out encrypted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=42.4s)]
*  Yet somehow he penetrates it and he goes there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=45.28s)]
*  Was he looking for these two specifically? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=47.0s)]
*  The security, I know people that have been involved in this, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=49.24s)]
*  the Jewish locations, particularly Israel-adjacent, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=51.84s)]
*  have been hardened because of these sorts of threats. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=55.36s)]
*  We had the terrible thing out in Pittsburgh [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=58.28s)]
*  a couple of years ago. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=59.92s)]
*  They hardened all of these locations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  So when he got there, was he intending to go inside, all right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Because that would have been a lot more targets. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=66.36s)]
*  And he had this gun. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=68.92s)]
*  He had a lot of, he had extra ammunition, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  He had a lot of bullets. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  So could have been a lot worse. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=72.8s)]
*  There's a lot of questions still to be answered. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=74.4s)]
*  In terms of the charging, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  they talk about hate crime, terrorism. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's a federal murder charge. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=78.92s)]
*  He is potentially in the bucket for the death penalty. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=80.68s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=83.2s)]
*  I just want to say it again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=84.44s)]
*  Does he deserve the death penalty? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=85.88s)]
*  Do I think he deserves the death penalty? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=87.44s)]
*  Well, put it this way. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=88.88s)]
*  It's on film, so there's not gonna be [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=89.72s)]
*  a whole lot of question regarding it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=91.0s)]
*  So we have a federal death penalty. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  If you're ever gonna use it, this is the case. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=94.84s)]
*  Am I personally in favor of it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=97.84s)]
*  Yeah, whack them out. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=99.2s)]
*  All right, Jessica, this has sort of laid everything [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=100.56s)]
*  out there on the table, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=105.56s)]
*  made clear a lot of the undercurrents [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=107.24s)]
*  that we've been feeling in the United States [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=109.72s)]
*  over the last couple of years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=113.88s)]
*  It is now very clear that Jews, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=115.36s)]
*  we already knew that they weren't safe [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=117.76s)]
*  in a lot of Western European capitals, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=119.28s)]
*  certainly not safe in Middle Eastern cities, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=122.08s)]
*  including inside Israel itself. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=125.28s)]
*  They are now not safe in America's capital. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=127.08s)]
*  Absolutely, and this is a trend that's been going on [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=131.56s)]
*  for several years, accelerated since the October 7th attacks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=133.72s)]
*  And you and I both have kids about the same age. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=138.04s)]
*  And I know people who send their children [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=140.8s)]
*  to synagogue schools, Jewish preschools, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=142.88s)]
*  and there are armed guards outside, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  which is completely antithetical [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=146.96s)]
*  to what my religion is about. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=148.68s)]
*  And it's deeply upsetting and disturbing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=151.12s)]
*  I was in DC the night of the shooting a few blocks away. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  And it's hard to believe in at the same time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=156.16s)]
*  It actually makes complete sense [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  based on what we've been seeing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  over the last year and a half. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  And my heart goes out to the families [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=165.24s)]
*  of Yaron Lashinsky and Sarah Milgram. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=168.48s)]
*  Where I feel that the administration [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=173.24s)]
*  has really lost the plot, though, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  is why they have decided to squander so much goodwill [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=177.16s)]
*  in terms of combating antisemitism on college campuses [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  by this level of gross overreach. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  What they're trying to do with Harvard, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  to take away 27% of the population, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=189.0s)]
*  which is the international population there, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=191.04s)]
*  what they're doing at Columbia threatening at Princeton, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  et cetera, indicates that they are a bunch [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=195.4s)]
*  of wannabe dictators who want to control [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=199.04s)]
*  American university life. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=201.88s)]
*  They want to control the curriculum. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=203.36s)]
*  They want to control the faculty. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=204.68s)]
*  They want to control the student body. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=205.84s)]
*  They want to control research. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=207.8s)]
*  No, they don't, Joey. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=209.12s)]
*  Under no circumstances. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=210.32s)]
*  We have a First Amendment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=211.68s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't send my kid to one of those schools. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=212.52s)]
*  We have a First Amendment, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  and we have academic freedom in this country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=214.84s)]
*  And that's what the courts are doing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=217.32s)]
*  They're pushing back from immigration to academic freedom. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=219.16s)]
*  The courts are showing up. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=222.44s)]
*  But it's clear that this administration [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=224.12s)]
*  is just taking every opportunity that they can [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=226.2s)]
*  to amass as much executive power and control as possible. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=228.28s)]
*  And they're also not thinking about the consequences [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  if the shoe is ever gonna be on the other foot. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=233.8s)]
*  It is possible that a Democrat could get elected. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=236.16s)]
*  And if you set a precedent that you're gonna have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=238.28s)]
*  this kind of level of control, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=240.4s)]
*  you're not gonna be very happy [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=241.96s)]
*  with the implications of that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=243.0s)]
*  I'm glad to see the university standing strong, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=244.72s)]
*  supporting their research communities, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=247.4s)]
*  but we are going to be less safe because of this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  We are going to be less prosperous. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=251.52s)]
*  The economic benefit out of these research labs [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=253.12s)]
*  is astronomically good for the American economy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=255.56s)]
*  And people are, you know, you can joke and say, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=259.08s)]
*  well, what do we want you anyway? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=261.04s)]
*  They're gonna go to other universities [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  because if you can be picked up, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  if you're a Turkish national with a visa here, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=265.36s)]
*  and you can be picked up and put in an ice truck, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  or you can't even get into Harvard now, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=270.6s)]
*  why wouldn't you just go to Oxford? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=272.24s)]
*  At the same time, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=274.2s)]
*  Joey, I talked to the DHS Secretary. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=275.16s)]
*  Do you know how silly that sounds? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=277.68s)]
*  Kristi Noem says. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=279.12s)]
*  Suck it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=280.64s)]
*  She says that coming to the United States [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=282.48s)]
*  on a student visa for any foreigner [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=286.36s)]
*  is a privilege, and she is correct. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=289.32s)]
*  It is not a right that anybody has. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=291.4s)]
*  Joey, what about the argument that it's simply [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=294.12s)]
*  incumbent upon the US government to vet foreign students? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=296.68s)]
*  You know, rather than getting rid of them, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=300.28s)]
*  what about vetting them more? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=302.12s)]
*  I'm sorry, President Trump is the president of hard reset [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=302.96s)]
*  because we've put our country in a place where we need it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=305.48s)]
*  All this complaining about Doge, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=307.72s)]
*  oh, they're using a meat cleaver [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  instead of a surgical knife. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=310.4s)]
*  Well, that's because when you do the surgical knife method, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=311.4s)]
*  it gets convoluted in what is government and bureaucracy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=314.52s)]
*  So a lot of these things are hard resets, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=317.88s)]
*  and it's okay if it pisses people off because we need it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=320.08s)]
*  Maybe if you get passionate about it [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  beyond your partisanship, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=324.68s)]
*  maybe then you'll look for a real solution. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=326.4s)]
*  So if everybody's, I mean, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=328.32s)]
*  I don't know who didn't see the committee hearing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=329.64s)]
*  where Elise Stefanik grilled the university presidents, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=332.84s)]
*  and they all looked absolutely foolish [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=337.4s)]
*  to the point that one of them kind of lost her job over it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  So when you say, you know, the Trump administration [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=343.04s)]
*  wants to dictate who's in charge of these colleges, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  there's a difference between wants to make sure [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  that these essentially bad actors [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=349.08000000000004s)]
*  aren't in charge of the college [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=351.04s)]
*  and deciding who gets to be in charge of the college. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=352.44s)]
*  No one's under any belief [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=354.68s)]
*  that Harvard's gonna be a conservative university [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  or that Columbia is gonna be a conservative university. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=358.76000000000005s)]
*  Columbia goes back 20 years of hating on veterans. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=360.92s)]
*  You think they're ever gonna change their ways? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  No, that's exactly what they are. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  They're extreme left. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  That's what the university is. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=368.8s)]
*  That's who they hire. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  That's the culture they've bred. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=371.22s)]
*  And the government does play a role [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=372.56s)]
*  because it is a government's job to keep us safe. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=373.88s)]
*  That's the reason why even conservatives [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=376.23999999999995s)]
*  believe in a big, strong defense. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=377.79999999999995s)]
*  And so it's our government's job to keep us safe. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=379.84s)]
*  And one of those roles and responsibilities [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=382.12s)]
*  is helping administer the law [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  and decide who gets to come into our country [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=386.28s)]
*  and who gets to stay. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=387.67999999999995s)]
*  And if you're coming here to sow hate and discontent, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  then your ass should be on the first plane [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=391.4s)]
*  or bus out of here. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=392.84s)]
*  Certainly if you're going to threaten people too [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  and make them not just feel unsafe, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  but actually be unsafe on college campuses. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=400.44s)]
*  I think that's Secretary Noem's strongest argument, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=403.82s)]
*  That university is failing its most basic commitment, right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=406.92s)]
*  Which is to keep its students safe from physical harm. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=412.16s)]
*  The irony is just a few years ago, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=417.24s)]
*  we needed safe spaces on campuses [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=419.08s)]
*  because someone like Tommy and Larry [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=421.4s)]
*  is going to hurt your feelings so bad [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=423.8s)]
*  you need hospital time. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=425.8s)]
*  Like that was not that, oh, and by the way, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=427.08s)]
*  that was all liberal violence too [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=429.48s)]
*  because every time somebody like Tommy went to speak, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=431.76s)]
*  they stormed into the room and pushed people around [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=434.52000000000004s)]
*  and they had to rush them out of the college. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=437.32s)]
*  So there's a book called The Coddling of the American Mind. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=439.36s)]
*  It's not written by conservatives. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=442.42s)]
*  And they give you a great history on [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=443.88s)]
*  how these colleges and universities [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=445.6s)]
*  have gone down the drain on this, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=447.0s)]
*  how they're not for free speech, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=448.76s)]
*  which is crazy like, oh, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=450.32s)]
*  this has got to be free speech and free thought. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's not what they are. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=453.76s)]
*  The right opinion from the right [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=455.44s)]
*  isn't allowed on these college campuses. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  It just isn't. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  And if you're brave enough to do it, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=461.96s)]
*  you're not gonna make good grades. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's that simple. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=465.0s)]
*  So Greg, why did you do it? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=466.46s)]
*  Why did you ruin Harvard University, Columbia University? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=467.74s)]
*  Walk us through it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=471.96s)]
*  Yeah, this is not about stopping free speech [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=472.8s)]
*  or trying to take control of colleges. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=474.96s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=477.02s)]
*  This is about finally challenging a destructive mindset [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=478.36s)]
*  that has poisoned academia. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=482.88s)]
*  It's a poison that these academic places [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=485.8s)]
*  have abdicated the role in. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=490.44s)]
*  They've let it happen. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=492.04s)]
*  This wouldn't have to happen [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=493.44s)]
*  if they actually fought this mind virus. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=495.52s)]
*  It's the oppression filter. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=498.8s)]
*  For some reason, one segment of society gets a free punch [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=500.36s)]
*  and the other segment of society receives it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=504.64s)]
*  It isn't just on campuses. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=507.16s)]
*  There are actually literally people getting punched [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=508.76s)]
*  on our streets because they deserve it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=511.1s)]
*  If you look at no cash bail, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=513.92s)]
*  decriminalization of mass theft, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=515.4s)]
*  allowing for trespassing, squatting, violent protest, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=517.9599999999999s)]
*  vandalism, harassment, there is an idea [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=521.88s)]
*  that has come out of the campuses [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=526.36s)]
*  that a segment of society is owed a free punch. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=527.92s)]
*  And the Jews, they deserve the punch. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=532.16s)]
*  That's what you're learning here. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=535.02s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, they're white-coded and they're successful [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=537.14s)]
*  in the same vein that the white South African farmers, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=539.78s)]
*  nobody cares about them. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=542.72s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=544.44s)]
*  Because they're white. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=545.62s)]
*  So they aren't allowed, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=547.48s)]
*  in the oppressor-oppression mindset, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=548.88s)]
*  they are still the oppressor, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=552.1600000000001s)]
*  even when they're the victims. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=554.36s)]
*  When Jews are victims, they are still the oppressor. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=556.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=559.72s)]
*  I just told you. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  If I were a parent of a high school kid, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=561.38s)]
*  I would really worry about the ease [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=563.5600000000001s)]
*  at which these really bad ideas can take hold of your child. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=565.46s)]
*  You know, when you send your kid off to school, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=569.84s)]
*  you're hoping that they get an education, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=572.08s)]
*  but now you have to think about, how do I inoculate them [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  so they're not swept up in a violent-minded ideology? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=578.12s)]
*  You know, the fault lies in this oppression narrative. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=582.48s)]
*  It is a successful narrative because you see it everywhere. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=585.4000000000001s)]
*  We now have academia where intolerant mobs are portrayed [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=589.5s)]
*  as the progressives, as the champions of free speech. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=594.6s)]
*  Oh my God, they're taking these mob speech away. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=597.8000000000001s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=600.5200000000001s)]
*  Do you know what? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=601.4s)]
*  If we stopped supporting the Israeli conflict, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=602.24s)]
*  do you think they would go away? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=606.52s)]
*  No, the mission is in the protest. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=608.16s)]
*  They would find something else. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=611.72s)]
*  So right now, we are the victim of a narrative [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=613.66s)]
*  that is being pushed by people who hate the West. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=616.4s)]
*  In a perfect world, you would be able [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=618.68s)]
*  to be away from these people, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=620.68s)]
*  but those two Jewish victims, they weren't harming anyone. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=622.4s)]
*  You know, the wolf came for them. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=626.28s)]
*  They weren't on campus. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=628.64s)]
*  How can you be sure your kids, you know, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=630.8s)]
*  are gonna be safe when they go to school? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't give three flying Fs [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=636.06s)]
*  if Harvard loses students to Oxford. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=639.5999999999999s)]
*  Boo, effing who. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  You deserve it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=644.3599999999999s)]
*  You deserve it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVllmGhwsZA&t=645.92s)]
