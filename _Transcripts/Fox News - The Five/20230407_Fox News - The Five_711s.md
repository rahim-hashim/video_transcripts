# Judge Jeanine: Biden jets off on vacation as White House left to clean up 'huge mess'
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng)
*  President Biden jetting off to vacation as his lackeys are left to clean up yet another huge mess. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=0.0s)]
*  In a classic holiday news dump, the administration releasing a report giving Biden a free pass on his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=7.44s)]
*  And blames it all on his predecessor, of course. The president couldn't be bothered to answer questions. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=17.44s)]
*  Biden sent John Kirby out for an embarrassing news conference while he snuck away to Camp David for some R&R. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=24.880000000000003s)]
*  The liberal media is furious after only getting a 10-minute heads-up on the bombshell release. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  And it looks like they're having a hard time spinning it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=37.38s)]
*  The word mistake appears once in this 12-page report. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=42.88s)]
*  National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said they were going to do a hot wash. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=46.88s)]
*  This 12-page document is a whitewash. It is narrative, it is light on specifics, it's devoid of citations. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=50.82s)]
*  There's considerable frustration that some people at the department think they're not being honest. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=58.82s)]
*  The White House needs to take responsibility for what happened in August on its watch over which it had control. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=63.82s)]
*  The father of a Marine killed in the Kabul airport attack agrees. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  You're the president of the United States. The buck stops with you. It's your responsibility. Stop making excuses. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  The fall of Afghanistan has marked a dramatic drop in Biden's support, which to this day has never recovered. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=85.25999999999999s)]
*  And now a stunning 67 percent of voters say Biden doesn't deserve to be re-elected. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  Okay, you know, Jesse, I'm going to start with you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=99.7s)]
*  The truth is that his numbers, and we talked about this yesterday, have dropped. They have never recovered. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=102.7s)]
*  But when Kirby came out yesterday, he said that he was proud. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=108.7s)]
*  And there was one thing that I found very disturbing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=113.7s)]
*  He said that he was proud that they were able to get out of a defunct airport. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=117.7s)]
*  And I thought to myself, you made the decision to exit Afghanistan not out of Bagram, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=125.14s)]
*  but out of a defunct cosmopolitan airport in the middle of four million people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  He's never had to answer that question, Joe Biden, about Afghanistan. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=138.14000000000001s)]
*  If I ever had him in the room, I'd say, why are you proud of that disgraceful exit? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  Why did you check your watch when you were watching the coffins come home at Dover? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  But, Judge, he hasn't been asked anything. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  The man is terrified of reporters. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  He triggers a raid in Mar-a-Lago, and then he leaves on vacation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  He blames everything for Donald Trump and then leaves on vacation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  COVID, the border, the spy balloon, everything's Trump's fault. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  If you could get the guy alone in a room, he would melt down. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  Just simple questions. He wouldn't be able to answer these questions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  You said you had no idea what was going on in China, but your family's getting millions from the country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=181.02s)]
*  Why did you say that? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=186.02s)]
*  Do you have confidence in your vice president? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=188.02s)]
*  How many times can the guy just lie and then leave? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=191.02s)]
*  I mean, I would ask him this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=195.02s)]
*  Why did you say the Chinese spy balloon wasn't a major breach, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=198.02s)]
*  and then they sucked up all of our intelligence? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=203.02s)]
*  I mean, what is your plan for the border? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=206.02s)]
*  Do you think that women should be able to play in men's sports? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=208.46s)]
*  Did the keystone workers that you fired ever find jobs building solar panels? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=211.46s)]
*  Did you ever make Jill Biden sleep on the couch after she called Hispanics tacos? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=216.46s)]
*  I'm just kidding about that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=221.46s)]
*  But all the other questions are legitimate questions. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=223.46s)]
*  And the White House and the White House press corps has this fraudulent arrangement [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=225.46s)]
*  where they allow the president of the United States to never answer a question. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=230.46s)]
*  And this is why this guy is a fraudulent president. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=234.9s)]
*  Because if you ever put me or Brett Baer alone in the room with the president, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=237.9s)]
*  he would break down. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=242.9s)]
*  Why are you dragging Brett into this? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=244.9s)]
*  Because he would never do an interview with me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=246.9s)]
*  Brett's more of a serious Fox News expert. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=248.9s)]
*  But you know, Jillian, one of the things that is true is that the press was upset about the fact [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=251.9s)]
*  that they got the Afghan report 10 minutes before the briefing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  They saw the president's motorcade leaving the White House to go to Camp David. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=262.34s)]
*  You know, you have been in this world for a long time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=267.34s)]
*  I mean, even the press is upset, in addition to a lot of Democrat congresspeople, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=270.34s)]
*  people in the House and the Senate. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=275.34s)]
*  I think that the problem, Judge, with the report is actually a lot bigger and broader [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=277.34s)]
*  than the optics associated with yesterday, which were terrible. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=284.34s)]
*  Like you mentioned, reporters getting this a couple minutes before the briefing started, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=288.78s)]
*  so they had no time to even read it before they were in front of the press secretary. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=292.78s)]
*  Despite the fact it was also issued basically as the president was leaving for the weekend. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=297.78s)]
*  That's all problematic. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=302.78s)]
*  But the bigger problem is that this report was really a decoy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=305.78s)]
*  It was designed as a decoy. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=307.78s)]
*  What really happened yesterday is that the Defense Department sent an after-action intelligence report [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=309.78s)]
*  classified to the Senate and the House, committees that oversee defense issues, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  to explain their assessment of what happened during this time when we withdrew from Afghanistan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=323.21999999999997s)]
*  Because there was no unclassified version available yesterday to release to the American people, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  to release to the media, the White House drafted this 12-pager. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  The National Security Council wrote it and laid out, again, the Biden administration's sort of talking points, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  which we don't need to hear. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=346.66s)]
*  We have all heard it 17,000 times since the tragic events happened. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=347.66s)]
*  So that's really what happened yesterday with this report. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=353.66s)]
*  It was ill-conceived, it was ill-executed, and then the timing could not have been worse. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=356.66s)]
*  Well, you know, there is some sound that I'd like you to listen to, Lawrence, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=361.66s)]
*  on the Marine who told lawmakers that the leaders ignored the warnings of the imminent suicide bomber. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=367.66s)]
*  Over the communication network, we passed that there was a potential threat and an IED attack imminent. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=376.66s)]
*  This was as serious as it could get. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=380.66s)]
*  I requested engagement authority while my team leader was ready on the M110 semi-automatic sniper system. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=382.66s)]
*  The response, leadership did not have the engagement authority for us, do not engage. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=388.66s)]
*  Plain and simple, we were ignored. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=393.66s)]
*  Our expertise was disregarded, no one was held accountable for our safety. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=395.66s)]
*  And the truth, Lawrence, is that the families of the 13 service people who were killed have never gotten any answers. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=400.1s)]
*  And they still want answers. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=407.1s)]
*  I think the sad point here is Kirby, the Admiral, he knows better. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=409.1s)]
*  He knows better. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=415.1s)]
*  He was in the Pentagon when they were advising the White House that this is a bad move, this is going to be catastrophic. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=416.1s)]
*  He was also at the Pentagon as this all goes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=422.1s)]
*  So all these stories and tales, he already knows all of this. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=425.1s)]
*  This is him being forced into a role. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=429.54s)]
*  Jessie calls her binder because binder couldn't do this press conference. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=431.54s)]
*  She wouldn't be able to do it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=435.54s)]
*  So they sent him out there and he had to play cover the White House instead of what he knows from his experience being there. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=437.54s)]
*  You can go through all the sound from back when he was the spokesperson for the Pentagon of him saying that it was a disaster. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=444.54s)]
*  That they warned the White House. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=451.54s)]
*  You can go to the testimony there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=453.54s)]
*  So you're saying that Kirby was not being honest with the American people? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=455.98s)]
*  He was totally lying there. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=458.98s)]
*  I think they did him a disservice by sending him out there. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=460.98s)]
*  Or did he do himself a disservice by going out there? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=462.98s)]
*  Well, he answers to the commander in chief. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=464.98s)]
*  But the commander in chief won't answer to the American people. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=466.98s)]
*  He sends his aides out there to do it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=468.98s)]
*  I think that's who we should be upset about is the president refusing yet again to answer questions from the press. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=470.98s)]
*  And I think that the press is getting tired of it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=478.98s)]
*  But then we move on to the next scandal. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=484.42s)]
*  And they let him buy on that scandal. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=486.42s)]
*  Again, the press can't be mad now because they allowed the guy to be in the basement the entire time. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=488.42s)]
*  How many live shots did I do outside of Joe Biden's Delaware house begging him to come out and talk to the American people? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=495.42s)]
*  So again, they can't be mad now when they allowed the guy to do this through an entire campaign. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=504.42s)]
*  Now they're suddenly upset that he won't speak now that he's the president of the United States. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=511.86s)]
*  He's doing what he got elected doing. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=515.86s)]
*  Presidents have spoken, I just dawned on me when Lawrence was talking, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=518.86s)]
*  presidents have spoken from the White House podium when fewer Americans have died. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=522.86s)]
*  The president could have spoken yesterday himself directly. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=527.86s)]
*  And you know, Jessica, the truth is that we left Americans there. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=531.86s)]
*  Blinken says that several Americans remain detained by the Taliban. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=535.86s)]
*  The Biden administration admits it left hundreds of Americans in Afghanistan. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=540.3000000000001s)]
*  And we've had to have Pineapple Express and not the American military help Americans out. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=545.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is a disaster. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=551.3000000000001s)]
*  I would not disagree with you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=554.3000000000001s)]
*  I haven't since it happened. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=556.3000000000001s)]
*  And there are a lot of Democrats on record talking about it, especially combat veterans, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=558.3000000000001s)]
*  people who were over there themselves and people who, for instance, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=562.3000000000001s)]
*  worked with these incredible folks who risked their lives to be interpreters for us. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=565.3000000000001s)]
*  To fight alongside us. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=569.74s)]
*  And then their visas couldn't be sped up fast enough and they were left behind. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=571.74s)]
*  There's something outrageous, like an 18 year backlog to do this. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=575.74s)]
*  I think a lot about how important and what a special class veterans are in this country. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=580.74s)]
*  And they should be in every country, but they deserve to be treated differently [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=587.74s)]
*  because they're willing to sacrifice their lives for us. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=590.74s)]
*  And that's something that's emphasized in every administration, how special these people are. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=593.74s)]
*  And in thinking back to how angry people were, myself included, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=598.1800000000001s)]
*  that President Trump wouldn't address veterans who were angry with him [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=604.1800000000001s)]
*  about mocking John McCain like a Khazir Khan type of person. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=608.1800000000001s)]
*  And we said, you should always talk to these people because if they've got something to say, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=612.1800000000001s)]
*  they know more than we do about these issues, these people who are gold star families, et cetera. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=616.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think that Joe Biden owes these people that respect to talk to them, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=621.1800000000001s)]
*  to face them, to address the American public about it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=626.62s)]
*  And he did in a speech say, the buck stops with me about those 13 service members who lost their lives. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=628.62s)]
*  But this certainly was an opportunity. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=633.62s)]
*  And I don't begrudge him going to Camp David for Easter break. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=635.62s)]
*  That's a silly Samantha. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=639.62s)]
*  I'm begrudging for not answering the questions. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=641.62s)]
*  And also, he has this weird thing that he does, and he did it when we lost these 13, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=643.62s)]
*  that he took it back to Bo. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=648.62s)]
*  We have all lost family members at some point in time, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=651.0600000000001s)]
*  but you don't get to invoke your dead son to use it as cover when you're addressing a travesty that you cause. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=656.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he does it all the time. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=663.0600000000001s)]
*  He does it all the time. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=665.0600000000001s)]
*  Anytime there is a national tragedy, he says, I understand because I lost a son. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=667.0600000000001s)]
*  No, you don't understand. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  You put their lives in danger. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=673.0600000000001s)]
*  And I think that's what the people want. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=675.0600000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you've got to take the L as the commander in chief. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=677.0600000000001s)]
*  And he hasn't been willing to do so. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=680.5s)]
*  And it was a disservice to send Admiral Kirby there, who was there trying to facilitate a lot of this stuff. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=682.5s)]
*  It would have been a disservice to send Corrine Jean-Pierre, even though she's the press secretary. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=688.5s)]
*  Go face the American people yourself. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=692.5s)]
*  Be a leader. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=694.5s)]
*  He has trouble doing that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs7gz3jQng&t=696.5s)]
