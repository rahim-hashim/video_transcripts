# Trump 'smells blood' with Canada: Judge Jeanine
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc)
*  President Trump and Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney, meeting at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=0.0s)]
*  And, unlike their last blackface, lovin' soy boy, 47 clicked with fellow businessman Carney, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=3.88s)]
*  drizzling a little maple syrup while asking for the keys to the kingdom. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=9.4s)]
*  A few days ago, he won a very big election in Canada, and I think I was probably the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  greatest thing that happened to him, but I can't take folk for that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=19.12s)]
*  Canada chose a very talented person, a very good person. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=22.72s)]
*  I have a lot of respect for this man. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm a real estate developer at heart. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=26.96s)]
*  When you get rid of that artificially drawn line, somebody drew that line many years ago. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=29.42s)]
*  When you look at that beautiful formation when it's together. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=33.5s)]
*  There are some places that are never for sale. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=37.02s)]
*  That's true. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  We're sitting in one right now, you know, Buckingham Palace that you visited as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  It's not for sale, won't be for sale ever, but the opportunity is in the partnership. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=44.14s)]
*  But I say, never say never. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=50.5s)]
*  But don't get any ideas that President Trump has softened his trade stance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=54.1s)]
*  Think of us as a super luxury store, a store that has the goods. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=58.56s)]
*  You're going to come and you're going to pay a price and we're going to give you a very [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=64.94s)]
*  good price. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=68.22s)]
*  We could sign 25 deals right now, Howard, if we wanted. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=69.22s)]
*  We don't have to sign deals. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=73.16s)]
*  They have to sign deals with us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=74.16s)]
*  They want a piece of our market. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  We don't want a piece of their market. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=77.76s)]
*  We've been ripped off by everybody for 50 years, for 50 years, and we're just not going [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=79.2s)]
*  to do that anymore. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=86.7s)]
*  So, Judge, he's basically, his strategy is always to direct attention urgently to a matter, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=88.8s)]
*  in this case, trade fairness, under the assumption that leaders will always just wait out a president. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=93.88s)]
*  How do you think this went? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=100.18s)]
*  I have a totally different take. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  I've been thinking about this and, you know, we are the biggest consumer and apparently [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=106.62s)]
*  Canada relies on us to sell 75% of its exports and a third of its imports are from us. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=111.56s)]
*  But Donald Trump is the ultimate deal maker and nothing comes out of his mouth that isn't [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  connected at some point to a deal. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=127.76s)]
*  And I think that President Trump is sensing weakness and I think he smells blood. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=131.96s)]
*  Recently, there has been an attempt by a few of the provinces in Canada to secede. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  The provinces that want to secede are Alberta, Quebec, and I think there's another one. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=146.0s)]
*  These are the largest oil producers in Canada. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=154.32s)]
*  So if there is a sense in Canada that, you know, the people aren't happy, the provinces [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=159.66s)]
*  that have talked about seceding are saying that the Canadian federal government is not [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=165.76s)]
*  concerned about them, it may be that Trump is sensing this and he's going to target them [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=169.88s)]
*  and that all of this is just kind of, you know, like another discussion, but it's really [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=175.88s)]
*  about those places that want to secede. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=182.0s)]
*  Never heard that, did you, Justin? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=184.76s)]
*  I said it a couple months ago, but that's okay, Justin. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=186.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=189.76s)]
*  No, I think we want Alberta because they're the powerhouse. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=190.76s)]
*  They have all the oil, as the judge said, they have all the minerals. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=194.04s)]
*  We don't want Quebec. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=196.04s)]
*  They're just a bunch of old liberals. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=197.04s)]
*  They're also conservative in Alberta. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=199.08s)]
*  So it's not a great beautiful line like what you'd see, which is kind of look like a big [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=201.84s)]
*  Florida that would shoot up north, but it would give us access to the Arctic. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=205.86s)]
*  There's going to be a referendum. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=211.3s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be possible, but I like how he's using the leverage. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=212.3s)]
*  If these people want to go, just use that as like a little pressure point to exploit [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=215.76s)]
*  them for concessions because he's right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=219.8s)]
*  It is a huge department store. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=221.64s)]
*  Pay them a premium to get into our country, put your product on the shelf, and we'll buy [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  They need us more than we need them, and that's what Trump has been saying this whole time. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  He needs to strike a little chemistry with this president. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  We don't need a Zelinsky. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=239.32s)]
*  People were saying this was going to be a Zelinsky, meaning it wasn't. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=241.0s)]
*  It was quite lovely, quite diplomatic, and I think people need to get used to the fact [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=243.94s)]
*  that Trump is diplomatic, maybe not on truth social, but when he's face to face, he's good. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=249.36s)]
*  He's asking, what do you have to offer Canada? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=255.24s)]
*  Are we going to get a mineral deal? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=257.56s)]
*  Are you going to help with border security? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=259.22s)]
*  That's what this is all about. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=262.22s)]
*  What are we going to get out of this? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=263.82s)]
*  I think you're seeing a little bit of progress. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=265.48s)]
*  This guy, best thing he has going for him, he's not Trudeau. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=267.92s)]
*  Yeah, he's not a nepotistic wonder with the famous... [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvVtI9Mohmc&t=271.6s)]
