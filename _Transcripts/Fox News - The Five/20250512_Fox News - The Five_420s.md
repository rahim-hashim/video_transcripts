# 'The Five' on ‘DEMSURRECTION’
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4)
*  We say no, we say no, we say no, we say no, battle chains is about to go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats singing for the rights of suspected murderers, terrorist child rapists, and MS-13 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=9.28s)]
*  members as they formed a human chain outside an ICE facility in New Jersey that holds the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=14.08s)]
*  worst of the worst. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=19.48s)]
*  It's the same center that saw a trio of House Democrats storm their way in and clash with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=21.28s)]
*  agents who now claim they're the victims. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=26.34s)]
*  I think there's a lot of opportunities for DHS, for ICE, to deescalate the situation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=28.94s)]
*  They chose not to. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=35.34s)]
*  Nothing happened other than the chaos that they created themselves. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=36.5s)]
*  If anything, we were pushed and shoved. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=40.58s)]
*  I honestly do not know how to body slam anyone. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=44.66s)]
*  There's no video that supports me body slamming anyone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  Thank God for the body cams. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  The feds releasing footage that shows at least one of those Democrat lawmakers shoving [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=53.62s)]
*  and elbowing federal officers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=58.5s)]
*  Naturally, AOC's lobbing threats over the Demsurrection. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=60.86s)]
*  If anyone's breaking the law in this situation, it's not members of Congress, it's the Department [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=65.78s)]
*  of Homeland Security. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=71.22s)]
*  It's people like Tom Homan and Secretary Kristi Noem. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=72.82s)]
*  You lay a finger on someone, on Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, on representative, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=76.46s)]
*  or any of the representatives that were there, you lay a finger on them, we are going to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=83.94s)]
*  have a problem. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=88.22s)]
*  Jess, why is she wearing clothes? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=89.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=91.33999999999999s)]
*  We should have pixelated that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=92.33999999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=93.74s)]
*  We should have had a fewer warning. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=94.74s)]
*  Dana, what do you think about the Demsurrection? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that breaking the law in defense of people who broke the law by virtue of being [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=99.22s)]
*  in this country is viewed as a way to get ahead in the Democratic primary for the gubernatorial [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  race in New Jersey. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  There's an open primary, Republicans and Democrats are at it right now, and that election is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=112.86s)]
*  being held this November. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=117.38s)]
*  The guy who got arrested, the mayor of Newark, he's a long-time antagonist, and instead of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=120.74s)]
*  being criticized by people in his party, he's being praised. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  And guess what else? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=130.22s)]
*  He's got a lot of name ID. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=131.22s)]
*  And I would bet that his FEC report will show that he got a lot of donations because [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=132.34s)]
*  the perception bias is something that we're really dealing with here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=137.02s)]
*  I look at this and think, this is awful. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=140.54s)]
*  Against an officer of the law, this is crazy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=143.94s)]
*  In the meantime, on their side, they're like, yeah, go for it, get them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=146.54s)]
*  And I think we're going to have a lot more of this on our hands. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=149.9s)]
*  This also happened in Massachusetts, where you had a city council member trying to prevent [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=152.82s)]
*  an illegal, a violent criminal, illegal immigrant, a woman, from getting into a car to be taken [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=157.42s)]
*  away. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=162.94s)]
*  And so I'm hoping we don't see a lot more of this, but it seems to me that the Democrats [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=163.94s)]
*  are fanning the flames and wanting more of it and more of the attention. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  Fanning the flames. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  Everyone wants a mugshot now. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=173.22s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=174.82s)]
*  But that's so January 6th. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=175.82s)]
*  Trump is the king of the road, and that road is common sense. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=179.22s)]
*  And it forces its political opposition to resort to absurd theatrics and asinine alliances, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=182.46s)]
*  whether it's gang bangers or trans athletes or Hamas. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  This is because there's no room for them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=194.26000000000002s)]
*  If you reject Trump's path, which is common sense, you are left with indulging in tantrums [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=196.82s)]
*  and bum rushing, you know, an ICE facility, and you get yourself further and further out [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=202.46s)]
*  of mainstream. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=207.62s)]
*  The Dems claim they were set up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  They were in the grander scheme. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=211.74s)]
*  They were set up. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=213.34s)]
*  They were given two choices in this prison of two ideas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=214.44s)]
*  You either, you know, embrace common sense and put you in Trump camp or don't and look [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=217.94s)]
*  a fool. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=222.3s)]
*  We knew what they would choose. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=223.86s)]
*  So that was a setup, but they walked right into it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=225.22s)]
*  This setup was a giant room that said, you're set up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=227.5s)]
*  They can't, they can't veer back into common sense because Trump owns that turf. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=230.46s)]
*  So what are they going to do now? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  How do you go to the left of this? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=236.72s)]
*  Are you going to like move MS-13 into the Four Seasons, have Tren de Aragua take over [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=239.06s)]
*  Disneyland? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=243.9s)]
*  If they were really sympathetic, I could be sympathetic to them if these people took [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=245.26s)]
*  illegals into their homes, then I would say, okay, gotcha. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=248.84s)]
*  Remember they flew him to Martha's Vineyard and in 24 hours they were gone. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=254.5s)]
*  Yeah, 50 of them and they all could have been housed in Barack and Michelle's house, but [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=258.54s)]
*  they should have not to go down that path. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=262.1s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  I love the bump in music you chose with the melodious protest singers, Jesse. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=264.5s)]
*  That was really good. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=268.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=269.72s)]
*  Added to my playlist. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=270.72s)]
*  I love the excuse given by Watson Coleman. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  She's one of the Congress people that you're watching. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=275.12s)]
*  I think it's a he, whatever. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry if I misgendered, but they said if there's any such body slamming kind of footage, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  that footage is manufactured for a certain purpose. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=283.56s)]
*  Okay, so we're back to cheap fakes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=287.6s)]
*  Don't believe what you're seeing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=289.6s)]
*  No one made this footage. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=290.72s)]
*  It is in fact real. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=291.72s)]
*  And these guys have two inescapable facts. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=293.36s)]
*  Number one, DHS came out Friday and said point blank, had these members requested a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=295.5s)]
*  tour, we would have facilitated such tour. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=300.94s)]
*  And then number two, since then, some Democrats have gotten into the facility and said the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=303.78s)]
*  conditions are great. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=307.82s)]
*  So this is all for not. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=309.18s)]
*  It is all for to date this point, political posturing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=310.94s)]
*  So the conditions are great. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=313.66s)]
*  Are you going to take a tour, Harold? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=314.66s)]
*  No, but I tend to agree with what you guys are saying. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=316.38s)]
*  I think Congress has, first of all, what the president's done on deportations and what [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=319.74s)]
*  he's done on the border and immigration. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=323.98s)]
*  I agree with. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=325.86s)]
*  I'm part of the 80, 78, 80, whatever the percentage of Americans who are in support of what he's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=326.94s)]
*  doing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=332.1s)]
*  Are there maybe some legal questions or concerns that people have? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=333.94s)]
*  They have every right to address that with the courts and we have to follow what the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=338.38s)]
*  courts say. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=341.82s)]
*  In this sentence here, you and Dana are exactly right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=342.82s)]
*  If they have not asked, but we had our own, I believe Rachel Campbell's Duffy, go tour [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=348.70000000000005s)]
*  one of these centers, if they just ask for the tour, what you're saying is right. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=353.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't understand this behavior other than for the political theater and the political [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=357.26s)]
*  pictures it may give. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=362.42s)]
*  These issues of deportation, these issues of immigration are very, very serious issues. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=364.5s)]
*  And whether you agree with President Trump or not, or what we're doing in the country [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=369.06s)]
*  in terms of our policy is up to you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=372.02000000000004s)]
*  But what we can't agree with is behavior like this. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=374.38s)]
*  I want fewer arrests and more legitimate oversight. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  If you're Democrat or Republican in Congress, you have every right to exercise oversight. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=381.34s)]
*  And there's a process, as Kayleigh just said, in which how you do it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=384.85999999999996s)]
*  It doesn't appear that we're doing it that way. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=388.06s)]
*  Well, if we had put tariffs on these migrants, their labor wouldn't have been so cheap and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahfdtUrxGz4&t=389.5s)]
