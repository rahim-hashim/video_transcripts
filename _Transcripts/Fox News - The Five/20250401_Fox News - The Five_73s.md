# Gutfeld makes a heavy observation about 'Sen. Spartacus' #shorts #fox #news #politics #trump
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4)
*  And Senator Spartacus was busy getting his resistance on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Cory Booker ranting and raving about President Trump's agenda for 22 hours and counting on the Senate floor. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=3.04s)]
*  I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=10.72s)]
*  Dear God, if I stand up in this body and say it is wrong to put Pete Hegseth in the cabinet as secretary of defense [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=18.96s)]
*  because he's unqualified, he's unqualified, he's unqualified, look at a signal chat to see how unqualified he is. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=27.68s)]
*  Margaret Chase Smith continues, Dear God, my friend, I yield the floor for a question while retaining the floor. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=34.48s)]
*  Excuse me, I'm going to say that correctly. I yield for a question while retaining the floor. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=45.6s)]
*  I do not yield the floor. I woke up this morning, or this morning, I woke up yesterday morning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=50.8s)]
*  All right, Greg, you look like you want to talk about Spartacus. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=55.84s)]
*  Well, he's gaining a lot of weight. I mean, did you notice he's putting on the pounds? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=62.64s)]
*  That's what happens when you're under stress. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vp75u1MDQ4&t=68.72s)]
