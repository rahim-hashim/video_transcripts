# ‘PR GAME’: Watters praises Kristi Noem’s visit to El Salvador prison
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc)
*  from El Salvador, and he will not be living in our country much longer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=0.0s)]
*  How's this for a bad ombre? The feds nabbing a suspected top three leader of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  the brutal MS-13 gang agents busting into his home in Virginia where they [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=10.96s)]
*  found three firearms, ammo, two suppressors. Authorities say he's from [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=15.96s)]
*  El Salvador and in America illegally. Hey Harold, turns out all we needed was a new [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=20.28s)]
*  president to catch these bad guys in your face. I just want to emphasize the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  pace and the focus. And so no, these were not lists that were available in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=29.08s)]
*  the previous administration because they wouldn't do that. I cannot emphasize [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=34.28s)]
*  enough the collaboration and support and leadership out of the new [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=38.48s)]
*  administration that is so different than what we saw in at least the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  previous three years of my administration. And south of the border, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=45.8s)]
*  DHS Secretary Noem did a house call to check on Venezuelan gang members. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=49.84s)]
*  Trump kicked out of the country. Christie coming face to face with the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=54.04s)]
*  criminals and warning illegals out there. This could be their new home soon. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=57.56s)]
*  I want to thank El Salvador and their president for their partnership with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  the United States of America to bring our terrorists here and to incarcerate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=65.48s)]
*  them and have consequences for the violence that they have perpetuated in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=69.36s)]
*  our communities. I also want everybody to know if you come to our country [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=72.84s)]
*  illegally, this is one of the consequences you could face. First of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=76.4s)]
*  all, do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  can't make like please come back. You're welcome here anytime. Jesse, this you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=84.68s)]
*  know what I love about that visit? She stood in front of criminals in their [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  environment because usually Democrats when they want you to see criminals, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=94.2s)]
*  they're in court, freshly bought shirt, clip on tie, makeup over their teardrop [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=98.44s)]
*  tattoos, you know, more as the, uh, you know, the remorseful suspect rather [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  than in their own, uh, you know, soup of crime. So this is a PR game for the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  people illegals here. So if you're an illegal and you're a criminal, that's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=117.92s)]
*  where they're gonna send you exactly. So she's basically saying you want your [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=122.84s)]
*  head shaved, you want handcuffs, you want to sit a jail cell with 90 bad [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=126.44s)]
*  hombres, self deport. And you're right, I'm shocked there wasn't a prison break [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=130.56s)]
*  because that's like a riot right there. I, you know, I'm surprised if they could [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=136.6s)]
*  walk Tom Homan through that jail and you think he's hot at that point. But [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=141.56s)]
*  Christie, my God. So great. We already had so many gangs here. We had Crips, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=146.68s)]
*  you have Bloods and then you have the mafia. You have the Chinese guys and the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=151.48s)]
*  Russians in Brooklyn. It's like we had enough already. Yeah. And at the height [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  of the crime wave 2021 2022, Biden decides to let in 25,000 ms 13 guys. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=159.04s)]
*  And imagine you're at the Border Patrol and you see a guy with face tattoos and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=166.6s)]
*  you catch and release them. And not only that, you give a guy with face tattoos [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=172.12s)]
*  a bus ticket to Manhattan. And then if he gets arrested in Manhattan, they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=176.32s)]
*  don't even deport him. They let him back out on the street. You know, we [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=181.28s)]
*  always tried to impeach Joe for Hunter. They should have impeached him for the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=185.24s)]
*  border because that's really an impeachable offense. And they had all [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=189.38s)]
*  these FBI guys running around going after these Jan six. What? Well, why? You [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=193.28s)]
*  should have been going after these guys. And what a waste of time because Trump [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=199.56s)]
*  pardon them all. So it's great to see these guys going after real crime. And [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=202.56s)]
*  that's what we need to get back to. Judge in a rare show of intelligence, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=207.28s)]
*  Jesse makes a good point. Don't you love how Democrats only care about vetting [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=211.44s)]
*  criminals when they're leaving? Yeah, they're way not when they're coming in. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=216.64s)]
*  Right, right. On their way out. You're absolutely right. In fact, I had an [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=220.28s)]
*  appointment today somewhere and it doesn't matter where, but the person [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=224.2s)]
*  started crying. She was so worried that we were deporting people who maybe [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=227.8s)]
*  shouldn't be deported. And I said, you know, if they have these tattoos that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=232.0s)]
*  indicate their trend, they are rock was shouldn't they be deported? Well, maybe [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=235.36s)]
*  they didn't mean it, you know, and that's what we're dealing with. But look, here's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=238.08s)]
*  the good news, Greg. I mean, the one of the top three MS 13 gang leaders. Okay, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=242.04s)]
*  he's in this country for a while. He's living with his mother for at least [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=246.56s)]
*  6-8 months that we're aware of, but silencers, long guns, ammunition, the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  whole thing. So now the question is, what's gonna happen to him? Is he gonna [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=254.64s)]
*  be prosecuted? Is he going to be released by some judge who thinks that, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=259.92s)]
*  you know, we can't hold this guy or is he gonna be deported? And Kristi Noem, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=266.4s)]
*  to her credit, that messaging was excellent. You're gonna come here, boys, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=270.52s)]
*  and this is what's gonna happen to you. And I think the issue now, given [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  especially what's happened with Boasberg and the Circuit Court of Appeals, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=279.0s)]
*  where they said that, you know, we're gonna keep, we're not going to hold the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=282.6s)]
*  temporary restraining order. Now this has to go to the Supreme Court to see [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=287.0s)]
*  if the White House can deport these people under the Aliens Enemies Act. So [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=290.52s)]
*  we're kind of in a holding pattern right now. But the message is clear. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=295.72s)]
*  You know, most viewers aren't aware, Harold, that you were once in a gang, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=299.84s)]
*  and we've actually have makeup applied over your teardrop tattoos. So you're a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=304.04s)]
*  little biased here. But how soon before your Dem allies demand we respect the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=308.2s)]
*  right to due process for this character? It's good to be back around the table, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=313.28s)]
*  and good to know you have not lost your sense of humor or fastball. I couldn't [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=317.88s)]
*  agree more with what's already been said. If President Biden and his team had [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=321.84s)]
*  focused more on the border, Jesse, I think you're right. Not only would have [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=327.68s)]
*  been redounded to their benefit politically, as the judges noted, it would [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=331.8s)]
*  have been a good thing for the country. I hope they prosecute these guys. I [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=336.92s)]
*  hope they convict these guys, and I hope they send them to that jail, because I [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=340.88s)]
*  think we need to have in our records here that these guys are that, whether [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=344.48s)]
*  they come back, try to come back into the country or not. I salute the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=348.72s)]
*  president and salute this U.S., this prosecutorial team and Miss Botany and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=352.52000000000004s)]
*  what they've been able to accomplish here. Now as relates to some of the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  other things we're conflating here with sending these gang members back to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=361.04s)]
*  Venezuela, I support that too. I just, we should follow the law and do it. As I [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=365.16s)]
*  said before, sentimentally the country is with President Trump, though. If we don't [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=369.68s)]
*  follow every bit of it, you're right. People are going to want these guys out, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=373.56s)]
*  and the problem is if you round up 50 of them and three of them are Americans and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=376.56s)]
*  didn't do anything, if that's your cousin or your brother or your sister or [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=381.12s)]
*  someone, I think people may have an issue with it. But all that being [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  said, I salute what Miss Bondi and her team has done in capturing and arresting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=388.92s)]
*  this MS-13 leader and God bless them going to get the rest of them. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=393.0s)]
*  Dana, you know, it's interesting because it's easy for us to target [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=396.44s)]
*  Democrats for what they haven't done, because it's legit, even Harold admitted it, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=401.64s)]
*  but they will target Republicans for how they've done it because the aim is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=405.64s)]
*  unquestionably correct. Well I also think though that we don't talk enough [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=411.8s)]
*  about what they did and the effects of it. So you have Governor [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=417.32s)]
*  Youngkin who said, I can't tell you the difference that it's made. He said he had [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=420.84s)]
*  been trying to get after this guy for three years. The Biden administration [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=425.4s)]
*  was unresponsive. Here we have within the first three months the top guy is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=429.0s)]
*  nabbed. And why does that matter? I don't think we've also done enough to explain [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=433.08s)]
*  that once all of these illegals got into the country, they spread out [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  everywhere. That's what gangs do, take over territory, and the violence that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=439.88s)]
*  they commit is terrible. But one thing that's really interesting, a lot of it is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=445.67999999999995s)]
*  aimed towards women. And then you had the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, and the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary, Kristi Noem, basically saying in your face, MS-13, and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=456.8s)]
*  that we're the ones that are going to be in power now and we're going to do [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  something about it. You're not going to be able to get away with it from before. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=466.0s)]
*  The other thing is the communications on this again continues to me to be [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=468.44s)]
*  excellent and it's one of the reasons that the country continues to be with [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  President Trump, because they are showing their work and you can see it [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  visibly. And they got up at three o'clock in the morning to be there when this [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_mG0OqZYc&t=479.84000000000003s)]
