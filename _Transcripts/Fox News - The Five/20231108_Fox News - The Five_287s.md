# US carries out airstrikes in Eastern Syria
**Fox News - The Five:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q)
*  America has just carried out airstrikes in eastern Syria against Houthi groups after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  they shot down a U.S. drone. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=5.0s)]
*  So we want to get to Jennifer Griffin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=6.48s)]
*  This just broke. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=8.0s)]
*  You have more for us, Jennifer? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=9.44s)]
*  Dana, this was—what I can say is that U.S. military sources tell us that the U.S. military [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=11.08s)]
*  has carried out airstrikes in eastern Syria. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=18.0s)]
*  It wouldn't have been against Houthi forces, but against Iranian-backed proxies who have [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=20.28s)]
*  been firing rockets and drones onto U.S. bases. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=25.36s)]
*  41 attacks on U.S. troops and bases since October 17th. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=28.72s)]
*  We're getting more details now, but these airstrikes were carried out, we're told, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=33.36s)]
*  just moments ago. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=37.96s)]
*  They're just getting the bomb damage assessment. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=38.96s)]
*  We don't know how many locations, but you can—if, based on the last pair of airstrikes on October [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=41.44s)]
*  26, the U.S. would likely be targeting unmanned warehouses, storage facilities. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=47.64s)]
*  The question is, how many of those Iranian-backed proxy bases will they have targeted tonight? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=55.28s)]
*  Will they have used F-16s, F-15s? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=62.28s)]
*  As we reported earlier, just about an hour or two ago, an MQ-9 Reaper was shot down over [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=64.92s)]
*  the Red Sea by Houthi forces in Yemen. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  So far, we do not have any word of any retaliatory strike by the U.S. military at this time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=73.86s)]
*  But this is new and breaking as we speak, Dana, based on senior U.S. military sources. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=79.04s)]
*  So, Jennifer, why now? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=84.72s)]
*  Why now? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=86.32s)]
*  I think that they have been watching. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=87.8s)]
*  There's a very dangerous matrix of events that are happening right now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=89.96s)]
*  Obviously, the deterrence of those—that pair of airstrikes was not enough to stop [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=94.88s)]
*  these Iranian proxies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=100.72s)]
*  But as we speak, CIA Director Bill Burns is in Qatar trying to negotiate the release of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=103.2s)]
*  American hostages in Gaza. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=110.2s)]
*  Those are delicate talks being headed up by Qatar. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=112.72s)]
*  And so, carrying out airstrikes right now, it's a very delicate time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=117.36s)]
*  So, I think there are a number of considerations. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=121.28s)]
*  The Biden administration has said that they don't want to spread the conflict, but they [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=124.4s)]
*  are also very clear that the Iranians and their proxy forces don't seem to be getting [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=128.36s)]
*  the message. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=133.34s)]
*  Many of these rockets and drones are falling short of the basis. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=134.48s)]
*  But in those first two days, after October 17th, there were 42 Americans who were injured [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=137.32s)]
*  with concussions, some TBI brain injuries. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=142.44s)]
*  Two of them had to be sent to Landstuhl. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=146.16s)]
*  Nobody has been killed yet by these attacks, but it's only a matter of time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  And so there's a great deal of concern at U.S. Central Command that if they don't [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=152.64s)]
*  regain some sort of deterrence and Iran doesn't get the message that their proxy forces need [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=157.04s)]
*  to stop these attacks. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=161.2s)]
*  So that's why it's happening now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=163.0s)]
*  I think there were a number of reasons that they waited until this week. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=165.28s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=172.16s)]
*  We'll see if Iran gets the message. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=173.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=174.16s)]
*  Judge Janine has a question for you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=175.16s)]
*  Hi, Jennifer. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=176.16s)]
*  It's—they're not just relying on the missile defense systems now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=177.16s)]
*  We're actually carrying out airstrikes in Syria. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=181.2s)]
*  Is that what I'm—that's what you're saying? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=185.92s)]
*  That's what's new tonight, Judge. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=187.88s)]
*  These are—we don't know the number of airstrikes, but I was told on very good authority [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=190.48s)]
*  from a senior U.S. military source that the U.S. has carried out a series of airstrikes [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  tonight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=200.64s)]
*  We don't know the locations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=201.64s)]
*  We'll be getting that information in the coming hour, I believe. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=202.64s)]
*  But this is different than every one of these bases, where you have 900 U.S. troops in Syria, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=207.64s)]
*  you have 2,500 in Iraq. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=212.84s)]
*  Those bases, where they have been—some are small outposts—been attacked with these [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  rockets and drones in recent days and weeks. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=220.12s)]
*  They have certainly missile defense. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=223.12s)]
*  They have means to stop those drones, and they have been shooting down those drones [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=225.14s)]
*  each—most of the drones have been shot down by U.S. forces at those bases. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=229.16000000000003s)]
*  This is different. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  This is sending in either F-15s or F-16s to carry out airstrikes on Iranian-backed targets, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  proxy forces in eastern Syria. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=243.0s)]
*  It's significant that they are targeting in eastern Syria and not in Iraq, even though [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=244.84s)]
*  most of the attacks have been actually at bases in Iraq by these proxy forces. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  deal of concern at the highest levels of the Pentagon and at the—in the administration, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=255.28s)]
*  not wanting to destabilize the Iraqi government. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=260.48s)]
*  The Iraqi government is not—is, you know, it would be very easy to have the—you know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=263.76s)]
*  there's a very delicate balance between the Shia, the Sunni, and the U.S. does not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=269.68s)]
*  want to see the Iraqi government fall and then Iran move in fully and create that Shia [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=275.0s)]
*  crescent from Tehran all the way to Beirut. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  Jennifer, thank you for the breaking news. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=283.36s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mRCKw8t0Q&t=285.68s)]
