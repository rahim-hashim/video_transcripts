# 'The Five': How dangerous is a 12-year-old gang member?
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY)
*  Another prime example of the chaos sanctuary cities have wrought. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=0.0s)]
*  Cops are hunting down what they say is the minor league gang for Tren de Alagua, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=3.88s)]
*  who call themselves Los Diablos de 42. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=8.76s)]
*  It's made up of kids from Venezuela who are here illegally. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  They're accused of attacking NYPD officers in Times Square, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=14.96s)]
*  hurling glass bottles, basketballs, even a scooter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=17.88s)]
*  So far, five have been arrested. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=21.68s)]
*  Three more are on the lam. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=23.36s)]
*  One of the pint-sized punks that got arrested is just 12. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=25.04s)]
*  Apparently, he's the leader of a theft ring in Central Park. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=29.28s)]
*  Borders are Tom Homan shipping up to New York to address the situation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=33.0s)]
*  These people are in the country illegally. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=38.04s)]
*  This is just another example of sanctuary cities not cooperating with ICE. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=39.56s)]
*  And look what happened. NYPD officers are attacked. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  If you're brazen enough to attack an armed law enforcement officer, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=46.72s)]
*  you're much more dangerous to an unarmed civilian. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=50.84s)]
*  We're coming for them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=53.36s)]
*  And as Tom Homan hunts down the teen migrant gang, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  Trump's racking up accolades for being the law and order president. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=58.28s)]
*  It speaks to one of Trump's best issues, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=62.32s)]
*  The idea Alcatraz, you think law and order, you think Donald Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=64.44s)]
*  So Donald Trump ran in part on law and order. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=68.04s)]
*  It was one of the reasons that he got elected. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=70.72s)]
*  And at this particular point, Americans like what they're hearing from him [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  on the issue of crime. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=76.16s)]
*  And you see this right here with a plus two net approval rating, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=77.72s)]
*  far better than Joe Biden left office with back in 2024. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=80.8s)]
*  I mean, this gang leader, Dana, is 12. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=85.24s)]
*  What were you doing when you were 12? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  Oh, summer fun day camp, you know, like making those little bracelets [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=90.88s)]
*  and camp and things like that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  You weren't throwing a scooter. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=96.44s)]
*  I was probably playing school. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=97.52s)]
*  You know, I got to play school. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=99.08s)]
*  I'm sure everybody here, especially the judge, will have a lot of thoughts [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=101.52s)]
*  about this. But one of the things I wanted to say is that it's very frustrating [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=104.44s)]
*  as a taxpayer to be trapped by liberal governance, where your taxpayer dollars [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=107.72s)]
*  are going to actually fund things that are against your interests. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=113.28s)]
*  So, for example, the idea that as a sanctuary city, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=117.28s)]
*  you're not going to cooperate with Tom Homan and ICE for what? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Who are you protecting? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=125.2s)]
*  What are we paying for? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm getting very frustrated about that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=128.0s)]
*  And the other issue is, as I understand it, for a lot of these people, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=129.8s)]
*  there are they're in the migrant shelters and the shelters being run by the gangs. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  And then you have the situation where the gang members then spread out [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=137.52s)]
*  and they use younger and younger people because they know that those people [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=140.44s)]
*  are not going to be punished. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=143.8s)]
*  And the juvenile system can't take them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=145.4s)]
*  And so what do they do? What does the system have to do? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=147.44s)]
*  We basically pay to send them back home where they end up in the same situation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=150.16s)]
*  How dangerous is a 12 year old gang member, Judge Jeanine? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=155.12s)]
*  I've indicted a 12 year old for murder. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=158.44s)]
*  Wow. Because I think they're dangerous. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=160.96s)]
*  But those that that's clearly an exception. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=165.16s)]
*  But what you've got are these kids are being groomed. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=167.8s)]
*  To be gang members. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=170.64s)]
*  Remember, this is a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=172.32s)]
*  These kids have been arrested dozens of times. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=174.8s)]
*  This 12 year old, I mean, this is socially acceptable to them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=177.56s)]
*  They throw up the gang signs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=181.2s)]
*  They take pictures of themselves. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=183.0s)]
*  And Tom Homan's right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=185.64s)]
*  If you are willing to assault a police officer, you're a dangerous individual. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=186.84s)]
*  And let me tell you how the Democrats helped make this worse. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=192.04s)]
*  When I was a DA, there was a move afoot [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=198.2s)]
*  which was absurd because at that point it was 16. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=202.16s)]
*  They raised it to 18. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  What do you think this 12 year old is going to face? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=206.92s)]
*  He's not going into criminal court because it's not a serious enough arrest. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=209.28s)]
*  OK, it's only if it's a murder or rape, a kidnapping [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  that you even can consider them for an adult court. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=216.6s)]
*  But this kid is not can't go into criminal court, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  even though there are dozens of arrests and this is a robbery. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=222.28s)]
*  But in addition to that, what you've got is a family court [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=225.08s)]
*  that doesn't even handle him if he's 11 years old, if he's 12, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=228.72s)]
*  maybe if they want to do person in need of supervision. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  But no one's going to take it and take any responsibility for him and his family. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  So they're taking over Times Square. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=239.72s)]
*  They're proud of it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=242.28s)]
*  The legal system is cutting them loose. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=243.52s)]
*  And we've got a police department that is being prevented from protecting, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=245.84s)]
*  as Dana was saying, American citizens. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=249.52s)]
*  I'll tell you the way to resolve this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=251.8s)]
*  If I'm ICE, I notify NYPD. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=253.48s)]
*  I tell them because that's what I did when I was DA. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=256.56s)]
*  I would tell a jurisdiction I'm coming in. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=259.2s)]
*  You want to join us? Great. You don't. We're coming in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=260.96s)]
*  All right. And you go in and you make the arrest. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=263.4s)]
*  Show up at the Roosevelt Hotel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=266.44s)]
*  I don't want my taxpayer dollars taking care of people who assault women, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=268.52s)]
*  throw them up against the wall and rob them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=272.44s)]
*  And then we pay for their dinner and their lodging. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=274.56s)]
*  Are you kidding? And in the end, this is a preventable crime. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=276.88s)]
*  The Democrats with cashless bail raise the age. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=281.16s)]
*  Sanctuary cities are putting Americans in danger. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  How soon, Greg, is the media going to call this person a Manhattan teen? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=288.32s)]
*  I am. I think that judge you are way out of line. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=293.24s)]
*  You're being too harsh on these teens. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=296.68s)]
*  Clearly, they're disadvantaged. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=298.48s)]
*  The food selection at their hotel is lacking in gluten free ethnic choices. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=300.36s)]
*  Right. The Wi-Fi is slow. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=304.92s)]
*  So many things are in English. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=306.72s)]
*  And that's oppressive and imperialistic. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=308.84s)]
*  I demand that Senator Van Hollen come to Times Square right now [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=311.28s)]
*  and meet with these young scamps, share a cherry coke, discuss due process. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=316.44s)]
*  I know what drives me crazy is when you always hear this canard. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=323.4s)]
*  Is that the word? I think so. I'll use it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  Illegals commit fewer crimes than actual citizens. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  And you go, well, and then they'll go, well, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=334.12s)]
*  they also don't report crimes because if you expose that, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=337.44s)]
*  that'll expose them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=340.36s)]
*  Deportation. You can't have both. It's a lie. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=341.04s)]
*  It's a lie. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  That's the data always lumps illegal immigrants with legal immigrants. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=344.36s)]
*  Legal immigrants actually commit fewer crimes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  Illegal immigrants. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=350.48s)]
*  Oh, they commit a lot of crimes or were like 45 percent more likely to be in a gang. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  There are 142 percent more likely to commit or be convicted of a crime. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  Usually more serious and more violent crimes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=362.0s)]
*  They make up a disproportionate share of prisons in Arizona. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=365.64s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  So on top of that, the FBI does miss a lot of the incidents of violence [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=371.04s)]
*  and property crime because they aren't reported because a lot of the legal [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=375.56s)]
*  crime is on other illegals in that neighborhood. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  The FBI estimates maybe it's 40 percent of violent crime and 30 percent of property crime. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=381.88s)]
*  So the next episode says, oh, but you know, this they're law abiding. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=386.12s)]
*  That's not law abiding. We see with our eyes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=388.92s)]
*  We know what crime. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  We just saw a video of these cops in Tennessee pull over this guy who was human [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  smuggling and they just let him off. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=396.72s)]
*  Yeah. If they're not reported, they're just getting let off. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=398.2s)]
*  Do you have any statistics to refute what Greg just said? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=401.36s)]
*  Leslie. Well, one of my statistics, he was already yelling at the drop in property [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=405.24s)]
*  and violent crime since the 90s. But let's not go there. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=410.8s)]
*  Let's go with I'm not going to defend violence of any kind because I'm a liberal [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=414.0s)]
*  and we liberals are pacifists for the most part. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=418.04s)]
*  And in addition to that, I'm pretty conservative when it comes to crime. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=420.36s)]
*  I sometimes get grief from those in my party when it comes to that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=424.36s)]
*  These are the type of people that Democrats and Republicans agree should be deported. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=427.72s)]
*  But it's how they're deported and it's how they're being kept track of. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=433.64000000000004s)]
*  For example, we have a video here we see with our own eyes. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=437.8s)]
*  There's no question. But there is a database and there are people in the database [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  that may not be illegal. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=445.6s)]
*  There are people in the database that are in there because of tattoos or because on Instagram. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=447.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen I have two kids in high school right now and gang symbols [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=451.68s)]
*  in their pictures. They think they're like really cool and they're really entitled kids [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=455.16s)]
*  going to private school. But this this is the problem. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=458.76s)]
*  When I looked into it, I'm like, so what is the real problem? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=463.04s)]
*  What is the ACLU angry about? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=465.68s)]
*  And this is it. If we don't have an accurate database of individuals, this is very different [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  because we're seeing it with our own eyes. We see with the video. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=473.56s)]
*  Absolutely no question. And then we go into due process and then we go into what the judges [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  have said. And now people like to say the liberal judges. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=482.08s)]
*  There have been two judges, one in New York who was appointed by Bill Clinton. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=484.6s)]
*  But the judge in Colorado that was appointed by Donald Trump, Judge Rodriguez, both agree [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=487.88s)]
*  that the way to deport these people is through the Immigration and Nationality Act in order [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=493.76s)]
*  to remove them, which is already on the books. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=498.92s)]
*  It is a means that we can legally remove these individuals and individuals like this are [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=502.08s)]
*  what myself included. We want the violent criminals gone, not the abuelos. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=506.8s)]
*  Trend De Aragua is a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=511.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=514.96s)]
*  All right. I've heard about that private school gang, Leslie, the Wasps. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=516.4s)]
*  They'll scuff up your dock siders. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=521.2s)]
*  I was a victim victimized repeatedly. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=523.08s)]
*  Ahead, President Trump smacks the hair gel out of greasy for letting Hollywood slip into [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=525.8s)]
*  foreign hands. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6T_f5nC7cY&t=531.28s)]
