# Jesse Watters: Anti-Israel, anti-American protests explode across the Middle East
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g)
*  Anti Israel and anti American protests [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=0.0s)]
*  exploding across the Mideast. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=2.56s)]
*  The Arab world whipped up in a frenzy [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  over the Gaza hospital explosion. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=6.32s)]
*  Protests have been raging outside the US embassy [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=8.8s)]
*  in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=11.48s)]
*  The chaotic scenes featured water cannons, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=12.88s)]
*  tear gas, even fires. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=15.02s)]
*  Mike Tobin is in southern Israel with more on that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=17.36s)]
*  Mike. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=19.8s)]
*  And Jesse, as airstrikes and artillery continue [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=22.16s)]
*  into the Gaza Strip, an explosion behind a hospital in Gaza [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=24.42s)]
*  sent shock waves around the world. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=28.14s)]
*  As you mentioned, the Lebanese armed forces [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=29.96s)]
*  needed to use water cannons and tear gas [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=32.32s)]
*  to control a crowd that was demonstrating [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=34.56s)]
*  outside of the US embassy in Beirut. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=37.52s)]
*  They even threw rocks and other projectiles [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=40.36s)]
*  at the embassy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=42.36s)]
*  Amman, Jordan, anti Israel protests turned violence [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=44.2s)]
*  as they did in Iraq. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=47.92s)]
*  In Iran, state sponsored protesters marched down the street [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=49.32s)]
*  chanting, death to Israel, death to America. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Security video supports Israel's claims [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=56.08s)]
*  that it was Palestinian Islamic Jihad [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=58.94s)]
*  that fired a barrage of rockets [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=61.62s)]
*  resulting in the explosion behind the hospital. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=63.5s)]
*  The, you hear some artillery in the background. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=66.7s)]
*  The video shows rockets firing in the direction of Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=68.9s)]
*  One goes off course, resulting in an explosion [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=72.96s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=75.74s)]
*  Meantime, after President Biden left Israel, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=76.7s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assembled his war cabinet [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  in the Kiryat, Israel's version of the Pentagon. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  Meantime, the artillery bangs away into the night. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=85.97999999999999s)]
*  The 10s of thousands of troops are at the ready, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=89.06s)]
*  waiting for their orders to enter the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=91.06s)]
*  Jesse. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=93.98s)]
*  Thanks Mike. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=94.82s)]
*  So Dana, you're seeing a lot of attacks against embassies, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=96.46s)]
*  not just American embassies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=100.98s)]
*  There was a French embassy, an Israeli embassy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  Do you see this spreading throughout the evening? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=105.26s)]
*  Well, part of the thing, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=108.82s)]
*  right before the commercial break, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=110.06s)]
*  when I said that Iran reportedly is running TV ads, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=111.18s)]
*  recruiting, this is their work progress administration. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=114.28s)]
*  Rather, this is how they give people jobs, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=117.82s)]
*  is to basically protest or to hire them [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=119.7s)]
*  in order to go and be ready for this fight. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=122.2s)]
*  There is, as I've been listening to a lot of different [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=125.14s)]
*  people today, a lot of concern about a second front [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  with Hezbollah, but also I got a warning today [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=132.98s)]
*  from somebody that we really need to pay attention [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  to what's happening in Iraq. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=138.32s)]
*  Khatib Hezbollah is there in Iraq and targeting our embassy [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=139.96s)]
*  and our troops there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=144.82s)]
*  So it could possibly be that they try to draw us in, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=145.86s)]
*  absolutely even more than we already are, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  but also all of Western, all the Western world. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  That's why you had the coalition of the willing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=155.02s)]
*  Coalition of the willing wasn't just because they were like, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=157.02s)]
*  yeah, let's go, we really want to fight. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=159.18s)]
*  It's because they understood that we face [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=160.58s)]
*  an existential threat from radical Islamic terrorism [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  that was as clear as day. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=165.3s)]
*  The moral clarity on that was not in question. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=166.24s)]
*  Everybody called the White House on that day and said, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=168.86s)]
*  we are with you because we realize what we're up against. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=172.02s)]
*  And then we got farther away from September 11th, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=174.62s)]
*  we got back into a September 10th mindset [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  and now here we are again. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=179.46s)]
*  But we are in a better position in order to fight back [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=180.46s)]
*  against it than we were. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=183.5s)]
*  It's just that everybody has to gear up. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=185.06s)]
*  We've got this conflict in Russia, Ukraine, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  with the Russians, we have the possibility [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=190.88s)]
*  of problems with China. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  We have problems with coup attempts in Africa, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=193.3s)]
*  which also is where you have radical [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  Islamic terrorism breeding. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=198.78s)]
*  So yes, that's all to say. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  I think there's a heightened awareness [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=203.6s)]
*  and I think the president perhaps will try to address [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=204.84s)]
*  that tomorrow night in his prime time address. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=207.6s)]
*  And I believe Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=209.76s)]
*  is probably sharing intelligence [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=213.44s)]
*  with the central intelligence agency [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=215.0s)]
*  about all these rising threats against the embassies. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=217.28s)]
*  Greg, that's one of the main reasons, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=220.12s)]
*  or a reason why we're so tight with Israel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=221.92s)]
*  I haven't checked my sources on that, Jesse, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=224.64s)]
*  but I'll get back to you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  All of this is going according [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=227.4s)]
*  to Hamas's strategy and plan, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=229.9s)]
*  And the media right now is their PR arm. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=232.64s)]
*  Again, the hospital attack was the spark [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=235.2s)]
*  that was needed to justify these protests. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=239.27999999999997s)]
*  I don't think the demonstrations should matter one bit, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=244.0s)]
*  We need to step back, because right now [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  we're kind of micro-watching every event. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=250.16s)]
*  Every day, something happens, something happens, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=253.44s)]
*  something happens. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  We need to step back from this [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=257.2s)]
*  because the decision has been made. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=258.97999999999996s)]
*  A course has been made. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=261.28s)]
*  You got to accept it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=262.82s)]
*  Now you got to look ahead. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=264.28s)]
*  What worked before? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=265.55999999999995s)]
*  The Abraham Accords. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=266.76s)]
*  That worked, and you know it worked, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=268.23999999999995s)]
*  because the forces against peace [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=270.11999999999995s)]
*  initialized its attack for that reason. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=272.08s)]
*  And so what comes after this? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  For your own sense of peace [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=277.05999999999995s)]
*  and just your mental stability, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=280.32s)]
*  think about what comes after. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=284.11999999999995s)]
*  It's a cooperative alliance of Arab nations, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=286.4s)]
*  To assume responsibility over the region [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=289.24s)]
*  with Israel providing security, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  a really capable president [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=293.1s)]
*  would be working on that right now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=294.74s)]
*  But we also need to look at this situation [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  and use it to predict what might happen in our future. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  Are there seeds of this lineage conflict brewing? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=304.04s)]
*  I've said it, there is. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=307.38s)]
*  Phrases like white privilege and colonizer [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=308.92s)]
*  are the currency of shaming and targeting based on lineage. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=311.32s)]
*  And we need to be persuasive [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=316.32s)]
*  in showing how mistaken this ideology is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=317.72s)]
*  because it's here right now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=320.76000000000005s)]
*  I can feel it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  You've seen it in Times Square. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=324.42s)]
*  You've seen it on these campuses. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  Judge Jeanine. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  The thing about Hezbollah [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=330.48s)]
*  and the thing about what's going on in Lebanon [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=332.16s)]
*  really concerns me. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=334.24s)]
*  Because whereas Hamas has these homemade missiles, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=335.8s)]
*  you know, they take things that we give them [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=339.68s)]
*  or that Israel gives them for humanitarian reasons [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=342.16s)]
*  and they try to make these bombs. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  You're talking about a very skilled military with Hezbollah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=346.62s)]
*  They are trained well. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=349.94s)]
*  They have very precision-made missiles. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=351.06s)]
*  You're talking about a serious, serious situation [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=354.42s)]
*  if that front opens up. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=357.06s)]
*  And what you've got is Iran, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=359.42s)]
*  who is now testing the resolve of Israel [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=361.66s)]
*  to see how hard they're going to fight [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=365.1s)]
*  and whether or not they need to get involved. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=368.94s)]
*  And the West Bank right now, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=370.86s)]
*  Samaria and Judea are very important [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=372.86s)]
*  because if they start fighting [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=375.58s)]
*  and it starts getting hot in the West Bank, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=377.7s)]
*  then the message there is we're all getting involved. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  It's hot enough now in Israel. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=383.78s)]
*  And a friend of mine who is high up in the IDF said to me, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=386.09999999999997s)]
*  you know what, this is not 67. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=389.41999999999996s)]
*  This is not 73. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=392.9s)]
*  This is 1948. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=395.18s)]
*  This is the existential threat that we face. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  And you've got this axis of authoritarianism. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=401.38s)]
*  You've got Iran. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=404.38s)]
*  You've got Russia. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=406.26s)]
*  You've got China. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=407.1s)]
*  And they know that they're in the fight of their life. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=407.94s)]
*  And Russia and China probably benefiting [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=411.1s)]
*  from a lot of the world's attention now off of them. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=414.5s)]
*  Without question. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=418.42s)]
*  I agree with the judge. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  I think one of the reasons that President Biden [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=421.18s)]
*  it's a pardon, I think Dana Open at the outset of the show [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=425.22s)]
*  has been giving advice to show some restraining, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=428.26s)]
*  that's be strategic about the response. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=432.54s)]
*  Is that he understands exactly what the judge just said. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=436.38s)]
*  Hezbollah is a far more sophisticated fighting force [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=437.98s)]
*  with greater resources, more missiles [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=441.5s)]
*  that are more sophisticated. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  And what we don't want is an escalation. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=445.94s)]
*  But I think with the president's presence, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  strongly suggested is if this is where you wanna go, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=449.26s)]
*  we are standing with Israel and we will be prepared [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=452.74s)]
*  for whatever you decide to do. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=455.94s)]
*  But it would be in your best interest not to do that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=458.26s)]
*  Okay, well hopefully Hamas doesn't get their hands [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=460.82s)]
*  on the $100 million Joe Biden's giving them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqjqjtelo2g&t=463.26s)]
