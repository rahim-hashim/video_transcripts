# Judge Jeanine: We are FUNDING terrorism!
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk)
*  Hello everybody, I'm Jesse Waters along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Jessica Tarlov, Dana [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=0.0s)]
*  Perino and Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=8.42s)]
*  It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=9.9s)]
*  Fox News Alert, we're just hours away from the huge vice presidential debate between [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=22.04s)]
*  Tim Walz and JD Vance. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=26.62s)]
*  But first, the world's on the brink of war with Joe and Kamala at the helm. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=28.94s)]
*  Israel's planning their next steps after getting attacked by Iran, the terrorist supporting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=33.86s)]
*  regime firing over a hundred missiles at the Jewish state. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=38.3s)]
*  Joe and Kamala trying to act like they're on top of things after Iran attacked Israel. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=48.02s)]
*  The United States military actively supported the defense of Israel and we're still assessing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=49.02s)]
*  the impact. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=54.78s)]
*  But based on what we know now, the attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=56.14s)]
*  And this is testament to Israeli military capability and the U.S. military. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  Let's go right to Trey Yengst in Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=66.26s)]
*  Trey. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=68.98s)]
*  Yeah, Jesse, this was a significant attack that took place across Israel earlier today. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=69.98s)]
*  The Iranians firing more than a hundred and eighty ballistic missiles at this country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=76.98s)]
*  Some of them were intercepted by Israel's Arrow 3 missile defense system, but others [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=82.04s)]
*  slammed into the ground below. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  We also understand that the Israeli cabinet is meeting tonight to determine what their [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=89.26s)]
*  response will be to this attack that sent millions of people to bomb shelters. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  We could see here from the city of Haifa in the northern part of Israel, as these missile [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  defense systems were active, they were picking off the ballistic missiles that were soaring [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  through the air. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=107.84s)]
*  And again, this is significant because it is the first time, according to Iranian state [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=109.16s)]
*  television, that the Iranians use the Fatah 4 hypersonic ballistic missile. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=113.76s)]
*  Back in April when Iran attacked Israel, they didn't use hypersonic ballistic missiles of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=118.9s)]
*  this caliber, the latest that they have in their arsenal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  And so as we look forward, there are major questions about how the Israelis will respond. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=128.02s)]
*  But Fox News has talked with Israeli officials tonight in Tel Aviv and they indicate it is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=132.38s)]
*  not a question of if Israel will respond, but rather when and where. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=137.18s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump knows exactly who's to blame for Joe and Kamala's latest foreign policy [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=144.9s)]
*  disaster. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  The world right now is spiraling out of control. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  When I was president, Iran was in total check. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=154.66s)]
*  The Iranians were starved for cash. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=157.26000000000002s)]
*  Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=159.3s)]
*  They had no money left. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=161.94s)]
*  They had no money for Hamas. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=162.94s)]
*  They had no money for Hezbollah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=165.12s)]
*  The people they're fighting now, they would have been willing to make any deal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  You could have made any deal, but Kamala flooded them with American cash. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=170.62s)]
*  All right, Judge, this is tough now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=174.38s)]
*  Right now in October, the world seems like it's falling apart. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=182.42s)]
*  It's the longshoremen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=184.66s)]
*  It's the economy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=185.94s)]
*  Everything's going on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=187.56s)]
*  But you know, what's interesting about this is you'll recall that Iran, as Trey Yanks [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=188.56s)]
*  just referenced, they shot some missiles over in April, and that was in response to Israel [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=192.54000000000002s)]
*  apparently bombing an embassy in Syria, the Iranian embassy in Syria. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=198.94s)]
*  This is a little more serious, but make no mistake. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=203.94s)]
*  Iran wants to be the funder of Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=207.82s)]
*  They want them to go out and do the fighting. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  They'll fund them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=217.06s)]
*  They'll train them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=218.06s)]
*  They'll teach them how to fight. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=219.06s)]
*  But the blood is only going in one direction. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=220.42s)]
*  So Iran doesn't really have the capability or capacity to do the kind of damage that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=223.17999999999998s)]
*  everyone thinks they can. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  And even their own people in Iran are starting to be frustrated with that country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=230.82s)]
*  I think what's gone on is that they are sensing that Israel has the upper hand, given the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=236.7s)]
*  fact that Nasrallah was taken down and the upper echelon of the Hezbollah, the Pagers, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=242.06s)]
*  the walkie-talkies, 3000 killed and injured, I should say. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=248.22s)]
*  And now it appears that Israel is on the march in Lebanon as well they should be. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=253.9s)]
*  But all the United States says is, ceasefire. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=261.12s)]
*  Joe Biden last night, ceasefire now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=264.1s)]
*  That was the quote. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=266.42s)]
*  And the truth is that Hezbollah, which is even worse and more sophisticated than Hamas, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=267.78s)]
*  created a UN resolution from 2006, like almost immediately. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=275.14s)]
*  And the UN and everybody's cool with it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=279.7s)]
*  But as soon as Israel tries to defend itself, then there's a problem. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=281.7s)]
*  JCPOA, they got the money. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=286.34s)]
*  We didn't monitor it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=288.78s)]
*  They told us that they were going to spend it whatever way they wanted. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=289.9s)]
*  Iran is selling oil on the open market. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=293.38s)]
*  And so as a result, we are funding terrorism. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=296.06s)]
*  And until that ends, or until somebody wins, you know, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  we talk about diplomacy, but at some point, maybe somebody has to win here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=305.06s)]
*  Jessica Tarloff. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=310.14s)]
*  Well, I feel and I hope that Israel is on the precipice of winning this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=311.14s)]
*  It's been an incredible couple of weeks and frankly, an incredible few months going back [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=316.62s)]
*  to April when they did manage to hit that embassy. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=321.46s)]
*  I think that Bibi Netanyahu, for however people feel about him generally speaking, has garnered [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=325.64s)]
*  a lot of goodwill and praise for the type of leader he is for this, the kind of statecraft [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=330.66s)]
*  that this took, the kind of spy craft that it took and feels as though the IDF is the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=339.74s)]
*  only force that could have pulled something like this off. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=343.74s)]
*  Iran looks weak in this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=347.70000000000005s)]
*  I understand it is very serious. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  I was speaking to a friend whose family lives in Israel and said they are all in bomb shelters. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=350.26000000000005s)]
*  There is not one person that is out walking around right now. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=354.98s)]
*  Iran has been humiliated because of what Israel has pulled off in terms of destructing Hamas [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=358.26s)]
*  then with Hezbollah as well, and they needed to do something. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=363.5s)]
*  To the point that Joe Biden has just said ceasefire now, that's not true. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=367.76s)]
*  The goal is a ceasefire, obviously, but he said firmly we stand with Israel. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=372.04s)]
*  They are using our missiles to kill these terrorists. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  They're firing off of our aircraft carriers. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=379.02s)]
*  We are part of this fight with them. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=382.02s)]
*  In the narrative that Iran was completely contained and did nothing while Donald Trump [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=384.62s)]
*  was president, the Iranians fired missiles at U.S. bases and over 100 service members [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=389.1s)]
*  had traumatic brain injury. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=395.98s)]
*  And that was when Donald Trump was president. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=398.14s)]
*  So this narrative does not hold up. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=400.18s)]
*  Joe Biden and Kamala are not responsible for what has happened since October 7th. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=402.38s)]
*  There obviously were questions about what intelligence failures there were, but that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=408.82s)]
*  is at the feet of Bibi Netanyahu, not at the U.S. president and the U.S. vice president. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=412.66s)]
*  I want to make one thing clear. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=416.70000000000005s)]
*  You said it was a lie. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=417.94s)]
*  Joe Biden said yesterday, ceasefire now. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=418.98s)]
*  He said that's all he says. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=421.70000000000005s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=422.70000000000005s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=423.70000000000005s)]
*  He said ceasefire now last night. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=424.70000000000005s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=427.22s)]
*  But that's not what you said. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=428.22s)]
*  You said all Joe Biden says is ceasefire. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=429.22s)]
*  He said ceasefire on October 8th. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=430.22s)]
*  Come on. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  One of the differences, Dana, is that under the Trump administration, the Iranians never [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  took Americans hostage like they have seen now in Israel through Hamas. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=438.24s)]
*  So the irony of some of this is that Biden wants to talk about his capabilities in diplomacy. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=442.66s)]
*  And he's made a lot of international phone calls. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=449.74s)]
*  We talked about the world. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=451.46s)]
*  It's like there's a lot of things going on. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=452.46s)]
*  It's not just in the Middle East, but of course we know in Europe as well and elsewhere, including [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=453.78000000000003s)]
*  Africa, all these places. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=458.14s)]
*  And it's complicated and there's a lot of it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=459.78000000000003s)]
*  But he wants to be given praise for the diplomacy because he was the Senate foreign relations [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=461.18s)]
*  chairman and he knows all the leaders and he can call them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=466.58s)]
*  But he doesn't want to be judged on the outcomes. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=469.82s)]
*  But what Biden has been saying to Netanyahu over this past year is, OK, enough, take the win. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=472.5s)]
*  Take the win. And I think what Netanyahu should say to Biden tonight is, no, sir, take the win. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=478.02s)]
*  Let's go. Let's press the advantage. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=483.62s)]
*  We have gotten we have helped Western civilization get to a point that you could be on offense [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=485.58s)]
*  again against radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=490.26s)]
*  So join the side that you're on and let's do this together. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=493.82s)]
*  So one thing about tonight in the vice presidential debate, I do expect for this to come up. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=498.02s)]
*  And one thing is because this election is so close, I was talking to Ari Fleischer on [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=502.3s)]
*  the show yesterday at Newsroom and in Pennsylvania, for example, Jewish Americans could make up [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=507.46000000000004s)]
*  a difference if the race is that close. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=513.98s)]
*  And you are a Jewish American who I interviewed one last week who said, I'm a single issue [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=517.1s)]
*  voter and my issue is Israel. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=520.66s)]
*  Does Israel continue to exist? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=523.14s)]
*  I think that they'll be listening to hear what Walls and Vance say about what they would [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=524.66s)]
*  do if they were ever to become commander in chief or if they can articulate what Harris [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=529.86s)]
*  and Trump would do. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  Gigi. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=535.46s)]
*  Yeah, well, this is stuff that's been going on since I was young and that's true. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=537.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, it doesn't matter who's president, really, it's just stuff happens. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  But I feel in this case, it's good not to listen to to Joe in this. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=545.5s)]
*  Israel has no reason to, you know, on October 8th, they went from wanting to deciding and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=550.26s)]
*  the decision was to exact justice for an atrocity. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=557.66s)]
*  And we should understand that if anybody were to say, hey, you should exercise restraint [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=561.2199999999999s)]
*  to me after something like that, I would be polite, but it would have absolutely no impact [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=565.86s)]
*  on what I plan to do. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=570.4599999999999s)]
*  If anything, I'm amazed at Israel's restraint and I'm impressed by their precision and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=571.54s)]
*  methodical response. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=575.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, Iran is, you know, Israel's playing chess and Iran is playing Yahtzee. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=577.06s)]
*  Compare their responses. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=583.54s)]
*  You know, Iran is lobbying these missiles onto a country's capital and Israel took out [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=584.94s)]
*  the entire command of Hezbollah with little to no collateral damage. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=591.22s)]
*  And this is going to be talked about for two ages to come. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=596.58s)]
*  Even Hollywood couldn't make this up. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure Israel already planned for this as something, you know, they know what what [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=603.94s)]
*  Iran's going to do. But Israel, you have to understand, and I said this before, that you [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=609.6600000000001s)]
*  kind of have to like let Israel do Israel. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=613.94s)]
*  They think like warriors because they have they have to. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=617.86s)]
*  It's not their choice. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=621.0600000000001s)]
*  We don't think like that anymore because we're surrounded by oceans and we're blessed with [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=622.62s)]
*  wealth and power. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=626.5400000000001s)]
*  You know, imagine if we'd use the Israeli beeper and phone strategy on fentanyl dealers. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=628.1s)]
*  But we don't. We don't. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=633.5s)]
*  You know, we're not allowed to. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=636.2600000000001s)]
*  That's in a way, you know, I admire. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=637.5s)]
*  I watched Israel's clear-eyed purpose in protecting their country. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=640.1s)]
*  And I guess I'm jealous. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=645.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm jealous when I look at our borders, when I look at our crime and I see how this [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=647.58s)]
*  progressive mentality has brought us here and how they are so steadfast in letting that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=653.0200000000001s)]
*  mentality, you know, corrupt their dedication to protecting their homeland. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=659.6600000000001s)]
*  Well said, Greg. Thank you. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=666.0600000000001s)]
*  You're welcome. Really. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=667.38s)]
*  Wow, you two are being nice. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=668.42s)]
*  I didn't mean that, but well said. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDLFIA3yRk&t=669.26s)]
