# Dana Perino: Congress needs to figure out tax cuts quickly
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60)
*  Panic ins can take a hike deal making Donnie is ready to talk while hanging out with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=0.0s)]
*  coal miners today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=7.28s)]
*  Countries are rushing to the negotiating table in the hopes of striking a deal over tariffs [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  70 and counting with places like Japan and actual country Dana set to get priority and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=12.98s)]
*  trade talks after their leader had a polite phone call with 47 and Trump says there's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=18.62s)]
*  more to come. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=23.02s)]
*  We're doing very well and making I call them tailored deals not off the rack. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=24.26s)]
*  These are tailored, highly tailored deals right now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=29.1s)]
*  Japan is flying here to make a deal. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  South Korea is flying here to make a deal and others are flying here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=34.54s)]
*  I mean, my only problem is I'm not sure I have enough. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=38.46s)]
*  If I told them about making those deals two years ago or three years ago or five years [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  ago, they'd be laughing at us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=45.42s)]
*  Now they're all signing up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=47.38s)]
*  The greatest president ever telling other nations the water is warm and just like one [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=50.06s)]
*  of kill meets parties. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=54.78s)]
*  You don't want to be the last one in the hot tub. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=55.94s)]
*  President Trump has a spine of steel and he will not break and America will not break [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=59.26s)]
*  under his leadership. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=63.58s)]
*  He is guided by a firm belief that America must be able to produce essential goods for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=65.22s)]
*  our own people and export them to the rest of the world. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  I think that right now we're managing a massive number of requests for negotiations. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=72.86s)]
*  I've seen the call list at the White House and it's substantial. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=77.5s)]
*  We were having a discussion last night about which countries to prioritize and I think [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=82.06s)]
*  you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=87.66s)]
*  quickly. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=96.38s)]
*  Nerds. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=97.38s)]
*  And MSNBC finding a way to smear Trump voters as racist amid the tariff negotiations. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=98.38s)]
*  And we chose a felon because we didn't want to elect a black woman. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  So to read that, to actually explicate that is to say we would rather destroy the republic [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=110.84s)]
*  than for that to have happened. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  That's not hyperbole, Dana. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=123.92s)]
*  He's saying what would he have said 10 years ago if he believed what the left believed [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=125.64s)]
*  was that this was a great strategy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=132.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=133.68s)]
*  Would he have been wrong then or right then? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=134.68s)]
*  This is the thing that kind of drives me crazy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=137.88s)]
*  I've been consistent. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=139.6s)]
*  I said I'm skeptical of the whole thing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=140.6s)]
*  But I would also add this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=143.44s)]
*  We need the deregulation to continue under Doge and at the cabinet agencies, not just [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=145.48s)]
*  with Doge, but that is going to definitely help the economy in the long run. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  Number two, we absolutely need to figure out the budget and the tax cuts, get those done. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=153.4s)]
*  The Congress is trying to work that out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=157.28s)]
*  I think that they're getting closer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=159.0s)]
*  But we had 10 to 12 Republicans who are saying, I don't like this whole way that this is going. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=160.84s)]
*  They took them to the White House today and tried to put the squeeze on them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=167.16s)]
*  I don't know if that will work. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=170.12s)]
*  And then you have the trade thing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=172.16s)]
*  So there's three prongs of this strategy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  You actually need all of them to work. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=177.16s)]
*  You might not like one of them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=179.4s)]
*  You might like two of them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=181.48s)]
*  But if this is going to work the way the White House says it's going to work, you actually [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=182.72s)]
*  need all three and they need to be moving at the same time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=186.28s)]
*  And it would be helpful, I think, for everybody if the messaging was consistent. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=189.24s)]
*  It is interesting and kind of fun to watch internal White House arguments. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=195.0s)]
*  Those usually happen behind closed doors. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=200.0s)]
*  Right now we're watching them right there in front of us, which is pretty open and transparent, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  unlike what you've seen in previous administrations, for better or worse. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  If it is a negotiation or it's not a negotiation, on and on. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=210.16s)]
*  My bottom line is this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=213.2s)]
*  The Congress needs to figure out the tax cut thing and quickly. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  You have to have the cabinet agencies moving forward on deregulation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=218.32s)]
*  And then hopefully the trade thing gets worked out pretty soon. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  And then you have all three prompts. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=223.96s)]
*  It's a great point. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=224.96s)]
*  We are watching the actual fighting in front of us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=225.96s)]
*  The sausage is being made right in front of you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=229.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=231.56s)]
*  And before, you know, they just hid Biden. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=232.56s)]
*  His decay from us, Jesse. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=235.32s)]
*  I think that the media and politicians in general are just shocked that a president [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  is fulfilling his promises. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not like he... [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=244.28s)]
*  It's no surprise to anybody who voted for him that this was going to happen. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=245.8s)]
*  He told you this was going to happen. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=249.44s)]
*  And like Dana said, you might not like one thing, but the overarching thing is what you [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=251.04s)]
*  voted for. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=255.64s)]
*  And it's what Democrats have been voting for for decades. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=256.64s)]
*  And Trump's actually the one doing it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  You said something yesterday, Greg, and you reminded me of Ross Perot. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=261.48s)]
*  Ah, yes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  Not your size, but what you said. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=266.08s)]
*  And I look back at the debate with Bush and Clinton and Ross was in the middle and he [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=268.48s)]
*  said, you know, you could have our companies go south and they could pay workers a dollar [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=272.68s)]
*  an hour, not give them any health care, have no environmental regulations. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=277.32s)]
*  Have no pension. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=281.08s)]
*  And you can make a ton of money. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=282.08s)]
*  And what you're going to hear is a giant sucking sound coming south. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=284.0s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=288.56s)]
*  And the sucking sound also came from the east, and that's China. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=289.56s)]
*  And now you're seeing what Trump's trying to do. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=294.14s)]
*  He's trying to destroy China. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=295.76s)]
*  Because if you break the Chinese economy, you put America back on top. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  The other Chinese thought they were going to overtake us. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=301.67999999999995s)]
*  It's not going to happen if this thing goes through. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=304.28s)]
*  If you can cut off their exports, they're toast. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=306.56s)]
*  You can't export all these cheap products here. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=310.76s)]
*  You're definitely not going to sell them into Europe because they don't have the consumer [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  power. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=315.32s)]
*  And so the Chinese economy, they can't consume their own stuff because they don't have enough [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=316.32s)]
*  wealth and they don't have enough families, to be honest with you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=321.76s)]
*  And so you're going to have to lay people off and then the whole country is going to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=324.92s)]
*  disintegrate. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  So that's a good thing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  And then you're breaking China off from Russia because this Chinese economy is feeding the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=331.2s)]
*  Russians. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  Now you drop oil to $60 a barrel, so it starves the Putin's war machine. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=337.16s)]
*  And then you separate those two countries. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=342.24s)]
*  So look what we're doing also at the same time in the Middle East. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=344.04s)]
*  You have the Syrians, now they're on our side. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=347.38000000000005s)]
*  Their proxies now ours. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=350.56s)]
*  And then you have carriers surrounding the Iranians. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=352.42s)]
*  And we're saying you better negotiate, not nuke up, or we'll bomb, bomb, bomb. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=355.6s)]
*  And if they can do a deal there, that's the second Russian proxy that falls. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=360.72s)]
*  And we'll get that Iranian oil back on the world market and it keeps the price of oil [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=365.24s)]
*  going lower. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=369.08s)]
*  We need cheap energy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=370.08s)]
*  And then the Europeans, they don't have another gain. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  They have to sell here. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=373.56s)]
*  They can't sell it anywhere else. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=375.42s)]
*  And what you're seeing is the EU trade bloc starting to break. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=377.2s)]
*  Hungary's trying to do a bilateral deal. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=380.76s)]
*  Your English are going to start trying to just negotiate directly with us. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=383.24s)]
*  And it splits Germany from France. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=387.32s)]
*  And then you throw in the Greenland thing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=391.56s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=393.48s)]
*  And then you throw in the NATO thing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=394.72s)]
*  Because right now, Pete Hegseth's going, oh, we might bring some troops home. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=396.16s)]
*  So they're really off kilter. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=399.32s)]
*  You've now surrounded the Chinese. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  They thought the Chinese were going to cut deals with the Japanese and the South Koreans. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=404.56s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=408.24s)]
*  Thought it was going to cut deals with the Europeans. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=409.24s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  And Trump sent Hegseth down to the Panama Canal. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=412.72s)]
*  He's saying it's ours. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  And we're wrestling TikTok away from that country, too. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=418.36s)]
*  Everything is moving perfectly at the same time. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=421.64s)]
*  But Dan is right. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=424.8s)]
*  You have to have the tax and regulation cuts in order to finish it off. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=425.8s)]
*  That was very thorough. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=429.44s)]
*  I wasn't listening, but it sounded thorough. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=431.28s)]
*  It's the giant sucking sound. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=434.36s)]
*  We're trying to stop that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=436.12s)]
*  Yes, the Jesse sound, as we call it here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=437.56s)]
*  So Harold, you know, your hero, Jim Cramer, said that the stock market action predicted [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  a Kamala Harris victory last year. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  He also told people in 2012 to sell Netflix. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=448.88s)]
*  And then he said that Monday was going to be a Black Monday. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=453.96s)]
*  Why do we listen to these people? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=457.04s)]
*  Why do they continue to lie to us? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=459.0s)]
*  Why do we take them seriously? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=460.52s)]
*  These are your people, Harold, your so-called financial experts. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=461.88s)]
*  I don't even think I'm going to let you answer that question. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=464.96s)]
*  Good to be back with you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=467.36s)]
*  I listen to these guys and I listen to people talk politics. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=468.44s)]
*  I listen to people talk sports. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=473.2s)]
*  I listen to people talk business. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=474.36s)]
*  And then you know what? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=476.08s)]
*  You actually watch the game. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=477.08s)]
*  We've had the game be played now for the congratulations of the Gators, by the way. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  We have the game be played in the markets. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=481.72s)]
*  Since inauguration day, we've lost 12 trillion dollars in our market, almost a little more [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=486.04s)]
*  than 12 trillion. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=490.24s)]
*  Number two, the S&P, which is the collection of 500 of the biggest companies in the country, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=491.68s)]
*  and we gauge, we people invest in that part of the market. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=496.36s)]
*  It's now below five thousand for the first time in a year. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=500.92s)]
*  In a year. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  So it was lower a year ago. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=505.20000000000005s)]
*  It was. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=508.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=509.32s)]
*  So but if we like, so you can be critical. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=510.32s)]
*  When you said how many trillion did you say? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=512.12s)]
*  12 trillion. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=514.28s)]
*  What's the total out of the total? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=515.28s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=517.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  It's probably about 80 trillion. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  We've lost 12. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=521.44s)]
*  Now, we said we want to break China. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=522.44s)]
*  We want to break China. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=525.48s)]
*  And we think we might. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=527.24s)]
*  The problem is we may break ourselves first. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=528.24s)]
*  Now, I think when the president talks about this, the thing that confounds me the most [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=530.04s)]
*  is he makes it seems that there's a binary choice for us to be able to do the things [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  that all of us around this table think we can agree on. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=539.68s)]
*  We want more jobs in America. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=541.72s)]
*  We want to produce more things here. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=543.0s)]
*  We want to produce more critical things here. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  So we don't have to rely on any nation to do that for us, whether it's a pandemic or [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=546.48s)]
*  not. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=550.04s)]
*  The challenge is there have to be other options in order to achieve this. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=551.4s)]
*  I listened to Scott Besson, the Treasury Secretary, this morning, and I tell you, he gave the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  market some confidence. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=559.28s)]
*  The market opened tall this morning. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=560.28s)]
*  It was regaining and trying to gain some of the momentum back. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=562.56s)]
*  And then what happened this late this afternoon? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=566.4s)]
*  Message came out of the White House. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  I think it might have been from the press secretary who I'm impressed with, Carolyn [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=570.36s)]
*  Levitt. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=573.88s)]
*  She said that the president Trump is committed to placing an additional set of tariffs on [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=574.88s)]
*  China this evening at midnight, which would actually take the tariff rate up on Chinese [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=579.4s)]
*  goods to one hundred and four percent. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  That's when the market began to turn. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=586.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, you don't have to be that smart to realize that maybe maybe small business leaders, big [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=587.84s)]
*  business leaders, consumers, retail investors, they didn't like that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=592.4s)]
*  So if you're if that is the challenge, the president ought to be more focused or solely [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=596.64s)]
*  focused on getting a deal with other countries or getting a deal with China or getting a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=601.6s)]
*  deal with countries that will force China to come to the table. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=605.84s)]
*  I just don't want to see us lose another five to seven trillion dollars. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't know how you get a deal once you've lost twenty trillion dollars. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=611.48s)]
*  That actually helps the very people that you really want to help. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=615.36s)]
*  I'm not rooting against you, Mr. President. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=617.88s)]
*  I'm rooting for you. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=619.36s)]
*  And in part of rooting for you, I'm saying to you, suggesting to you, maybe try a different [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=620.4s)]
*  tact than what you're trying right now. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=624.92s)]
*  You're saying you're non-binary. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm saying that's your takeaway. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=629.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=632.32s)]
*  Judge, I don't think there's any leader in my lifetime that's decided to risk, you know, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=634.92s)]
*  his approval to make hard decisions. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=639.0s)]
*  You know, I think that like this is not a decision that is superficially virtuous or [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=641.64s)]
*  vacuous. And I don't think the media understands that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=647.44s)]
*  They don't understand that. They don't understand Donald Trump. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=651.44s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump is winning the day. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=654.0s)]
*  OK, the day started off well. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=656.2800000000001s)]
*  And for all those people who said last week, you know, he needs to back off the tariffs, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=658.6s)]
*  he needs to back off the tariffs. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=662.5200000000001s)]
*  They don't understand Donald Trump. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=664.1600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump does not back off anything. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=666.7600000000001s)]
*  And right now we've got countries that are willing to deal, countries that are willing [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=670.0400000000001s)]
*  to negotiate, countries that are calling him up, flying over here to deal with him. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=674.24s)]
*  And, you know, when people say, you know, that people on the left and I'm not talking [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=679.12s)]
*  about you, Harold, but people who say, you know what, it's all about the rich people [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=684.08s)]
*  and all this nonsense. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=687.8s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump went around this country. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=689.36s)]
*  He traveled the country, talked with real Americans every day, and he understands the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=692.72s)]
*  shrimpers who lost out to Southeast Asia and he understands the ranchers who are losing [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=696.96s)]
*  out to Australia. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=701.8s)]
*  And he understands the steel issue and how important it is to our national security [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  because he's been through covid and he understands the supply chain. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=708.52s)]
*  But if Donald Trump only cared about himself and lining the pockets of the rich, why [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=712.28s)]
*  would he be fighting like he's fighting right now? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  Why would he be doing what he did in the White House today with those coal miners? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=720.04s)]
*  And let me tell you something. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=724.68s)]
*  Donald Trump knows where the shorthairs are and he knows where to pull them out. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=726.12s)]
*  OK, yeah. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=730.28s)]
*  And in the end, what you've got is you remember during the Biden during the Biden [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  administration, all those coal plants that were being developed in China to build those [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=736.12s)]
*  lithium batteries for those electric cars. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=741.1999999999999s)]
*  They can't supply the coal that they need for those coal powered plants. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=744.04s)]
*  They need America. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=749.56s)]
*  Donald Trump knows that China doesn't have the ability to purchase the way we have the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=750.88s)]
*  ability. So, you know what? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=756.0s)]
*  And let's not be so quick to forget where we were with the Biden administration with [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=757.8s)]
*  interest rates were at 7 percent, cost outpaced wages and the millenniums didn't care [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=761.76s)]
*  about their credit cards because they figured we could never afford a house. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=768.8s)]
*  So these tariffs are literally a transition to the golden age. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=772.56s)]
*  The man is negotiating, offering concessions to some countries. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=776.8s)]
*  And you know what? If you want to retaliate, good luck to you, because Donald Trump is [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=781.24s)]
*  not panicked and neither should we be because he's bringing us to the golden age, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=787.08s)]
*  Harold. And that is the end of it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=792.0400000000001s)]
*  Two more days of this will be long. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=793.4000000000001s)]
*  All right, you kids. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel-FOsRt60&t=797.36s)]
