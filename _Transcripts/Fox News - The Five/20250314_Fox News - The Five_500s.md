# 'The Five' wonders: What is Gavin Newsom doing with his hands?!
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc)
*  never live up to their names, say the views. Sunny Hostin acting not so sunny. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=0.0s)]
*  She's shredding greasy Gavin Newsom saying how dare he have Steve Bannon on his new podcast. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=4.84s)]
*  I just think this is a poor strategy for Gavin Newsom. I actually did think that he was one of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=11.48s)]
*  the leaders that would come out in terms of 2028. I remember watching his annual State of the Union [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=18.84s)]
*  address in California and he criticized Republicans. Now he has a Steve Bannon on the show who's saying, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=27.0s)]
*  you know, you're going to get to populism. There's a long road. He gives zero pushback. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=32.36s)]
*  He showed his pretty white teeth and his cute face and did nothing other than that. And I think it's despicable. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=37.84s)]
*  But if Gavin doesn't pan out, how about cackling Kamala? Did you hear her latest scapegoat for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=44.28s)]
*  losing in a landslide? Her chair height. A new book claims Kamala's campaign freaked out when she [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=50.72s)]
*  looked shorter than Tim Walz during their CNN interview says, quote, For the rest of the campaign, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=56.56s)]
*  her team required that she be provided a chair that met certain specifications. Leg height, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=63.28s)]
*  no less than 15 inches, Florida top of seat height, no less than 18.9 inches. Arms on chairs may not be [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=68.92s)]
*  very high. Arms must fall at a natural height. Chairs must be firm. So going back to the view thing, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=77.92s)]
*  Greg, you know, I can't remember last time I actually agreed with somebody on the view. I was appalled [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=88.4s)]
*  that Steve Bannon went on to Gavin Newsom's political career laundering podcast trying to make him seem [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=94.32s)]
*  like, you know, maybe he's not the crazy left wing goofball that he is. Were you upset by that? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=102.88s)]
*  Well, first, let's be clear that Sonny Haas and his racist because if Gavin Newsom was black, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=109.32s)]
*  she wouldn't have made that comment about his teeth. So let's start there. I do enjoy I do enjoy [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=113.84s)]
*  these Democrats going after Gavin for talking to people that he disagrees with. They don't realize [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=122.56s)]
*  that that's the reason why they suck. And they say, How dare you platform this person? That's the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=128.44s)]
*  new phrase for allowing someone to talk. You can't platform this person. Do you ever consider why [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=133.6s)]
*  Kamala was so hapless when she was talking and she couldn't string two sentences together? Because [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=139.24s)]
*  you never had a conversation with anybody who disagreed with her. You got to build up those [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  flabby intellectual muscles. You got to get out of your comfort zone. Although I know I'm very I'm [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=148.2s)]
*  cynical enough to know that what Gavin is up to. But you know, the weirdest thing about let's discuss [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=152.8s)]
*  the weirdest thing about the podcast was Gavin's hands. I don't know if you guys know Gavin's hands. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=157.4s)]
*  Can we do we have any tape of that? Like what is going on with this guy? Tyrus said that he was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  negotiating the price with the deaf prostitutes. Which I think is probably correct. But it's like [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=167.88s)]
*  who does their own sign language when they're talking? I don't get it. I don't get it. Is this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  something you've witnessed before? I've never seen anything like that. I don't think he could be [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=182.4s)]
*  president. That's too distracting. You know, and I ran they chop him off. That's why America is great. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=185.92s)]
*  So is he? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=192.48s)]
*  No, it's very bizarre. And I think that Tyrus had nailed it. I think he's negotiating with a deaf [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  prostitute. In fact, I will never be able to look at Gavin Newsom and his hands without [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=200.88s)]
*  We're already having a hand debate and we're not even at 28. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=205.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=208.92s)]
*  They should call Jeffrey Toobin for analysis. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=209.72s)]
*  Stop. Okay, Katie, can we move on? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  Can we please? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=216.12s)]
*  So yeah, please. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=217.0s)]
*  Welcome to Friday. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=218.28s)]
*  So exactly. So no, but it is true. Greg's right about this. It is dangerous to platform Gavin Newsom [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  and try to normalize him. He's a lunatic. He's also still governor. And he's running a state to the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=227.64s)]
*  ground. And by the way, part of the state just burned to the ground. Why does he have time to be [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=233.88s)]
*  doing this? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  I agree with you that this is a Gavin Newsom propaganda project and conservatives are going on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=239.24s)]
*  and they should do nothing but say this is a propaganda project. I can still see the hands [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=245.64s)]
*  even though they're not highlighted. Oh my God. I think he does this when he's nervous and doesn't [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=249.72s)]
*  know exactly what to say. There's actually answer questions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=253.72s)]
*  There's something weird going on. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=256.68s)]
*  But he's trying to remake himself into this moderate, right? He is shrewd in the sense that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=258.12s)]
*  the country shifted to the right. So he's trying to set himself up for 2028. But people like [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  Sonny at The View are totally detached from reality when it comes to democratic strategy [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=269.8s)]
*  and what they need to do to actually get back in touch with the country. To Gavin's credit, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=274.76s)]
*  he's trying to do that. But when she says cute face, white teeth isn't enough to get you to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=279.24s)]
*  the presidency. It's worked for a lot of people. He has the hair gel going for him too. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  So Harold, I don't want to deny you the opportunity to comment on Gavin Newsom's hands, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=288.6s)]
*  but I am wondering if you think that Kamala Harris lost because of her chair height. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=292.36s)]
*  No, she didn't lose because of her chair height. In campaigns though, that's not uncommon. As we [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  all know, people want all these things to be. But I blame the staff. They should have interrupted [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=302.12s)]
*  an interview before it got started and said, make, pull her chair up. Let me go back to something [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  Sonny said, who's a friend of mine. Of course she is. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=311.72s)]
*  I think we have to understand, we can't get to a point in politics where we don't like the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=314.6s)]
*  Tip O'Neill Ronald Reagan relationships anymore. That helped Congress work. We can't get to a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  point where we don't want people who disagree. One of the great debates about race in the 60s [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  occurred between two people who developed the rapport, William F. Buckley and James Baldwin [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  over in Cambridge as they debated the role of race and how we could progress. They had differing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  ideas, but they developed a rapport from it. We just lost one of the great senators, one of the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=337.72s)]
*  great voices, I think, towering voices in politics in the last 24 hours, Alan Simpson, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=341.72s)]
*  who worked with Democrats, Republicans alike, was as conservative as anyone, and worked with [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=346.44000000000005s)]
*  Erskine Bowles and others to try to give us a blueprint and a pathway to try to balance our [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  budget. I'm never one to believe just because you disagree with someone who can't be friendly with [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  them. We talked about this when Gavin Newsom said he wanted to do this thing. Greg, I think you [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=359.88000000000005s)]
*  even said, look, as long as he's going to have different voices on there, dissenting voices and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=365.56s)]
*  have conversations, I don't even want to do anything with my hands now. We shouldn't be [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=369.16s)]
*  afraid of that. I'm not afraid of a disagreement. I don't fear dissent, and frankly, I think I'm [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=375.16s)]
*  strengthened by it. I hope he keeps doing those things. Judge, I totally agree with everything [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=380.6s)]
*  Harold just said, but my question is, which one between Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan is Gavin [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=384.36s)]
*  Newsom? That's the problem. He's not even on the same plane. First of all, you know what, Sonny [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=391.48s)]
*  Haaston, are you saying that she's responsible for like you were talking about, like a regress, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=397.24s)]
*  a regression in race relations? By no means. I'm saying you have to be willing to sit. No, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=403.48s)]
*  I didn't say that at all. I don't think you can answer it. I think the question's enough. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=407.48s)]
*  The answer's no. So anyway, I mean, how can somebody who is in the business, my earring just fell, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=409.48s)]
*  that's from my jeweler. How could someone who is in the business of communication on television [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=414.76s)]
*  be furious because you don't want someone else to speak? But this is why they lost the election. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=420.2s)]
*  They want to deplatform people. They want, how dare you normalize someone who disagrees with me? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=425.8s)]
*  I mean, these are people who don't believe in the constitution. It's called the First Amendment. How [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=431.48s)]
*  dare you speak to this person? It is an outrage. You should be outraged that there are people like [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=437.48s)]
*  that who have the ability and have a platform to say, you know, the guy hasn't been in a position [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=442.68s)]
*  where, you know, we can all hate him for a particular reason. It's just she hates him [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  because of his political beliefs. We got to get past that. And you know what? If she can't, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=453.8s)]
*  you know, that's her problem. But let me just say this about Kamala and the chair. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=458.68s)]
*  While, you know, while the country's going through all these problems, Kamala's worried about a chair [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=462.76s)]
*  and the arm length and the leg length. She should have been worried about her brain because she [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=467.72s)]
*  couldn't engage the brain. Forget about the chair. She's the most inarticulate candidate we've ever [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=471.88s)]
*  had run for national office. And so there- I hope your other earring falls out. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=477.32s)]
*  So you need not look. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=481.88s)]
*  Of chair size was or hand movements was going to help her brain. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=483.56s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPZWTvV0fvc&t=487.56s)]
