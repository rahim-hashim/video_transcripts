# ‘The Five’: Trump flexes his tariff muscle
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw)
*  President Trump flexing his tariff muscle as he takes the economy on a trade [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=0.0s)]
*  rollercoaster in his push for fair deals. The president is exempting many [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=4.96s)]
*  electronics, smartphones, laptops and other products from newly implemented [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=8.76s)]
*  tariffs but then he announced on True Social that nobody is getting off the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=12.64s)]
*  hook, especially China. Those products are just moving to a different tariff [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=17.04s)]
*  bucket. Trump chalking up the whiplash to his flexibility. I'm a very flexible [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=21.8s)]
*  person. I don't change my mind, but I'm flexible and you have to be. We lost [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  with China over the Biden years, trillions of dollars on trade, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=32.5s)]
*  trillions of dollars, and he let them fleece us and we can't do that anymore. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=38.4s)]
*  The end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=44.6s)]
*  country. We're the greatest economic power in the world. If we're smart, if [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  we're not smart, we're gonna hurt our country very badly. Last week it was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=54.2s)]
*  75 countries wanting to come to the tariff negotiating table and now the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  White House is upping that number. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  130 countries have responded and we're negotiating with them and they've got [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=66.08s)]
*  their rate down to 10%. It's a really it's it's kind of almost a two world [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=70.64s)]
*  system. There's there's a process about China and that's very, very nascent if [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=74.78s)]
*  at all. And then the process for everybody else. So the process for [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  everybody else is orderly. It's clear people are coming to town with great, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=83.0s)]
*  great offers. Meanwhile, United Auto Workers Union President Sean Fain, who [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=87.8s)]
*  campaigned with Kamala Harris last year while he is backing up Trump's tariffs [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=93.28s)]
*  as a way to bring jobs back to America. Watch [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=97.24s)]
*  know that tariffs will influence these companies to do the right thing and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=101.2s)]
*  reinvest in this country and reinvest in factories in this country. I'm really [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=105.06s)]
*  struggling to figure out to understand how UAW has aligned itself with Trump on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=108.66s)]
*  this. Well, how do tariffs create jobs? We support tariffs as a tool, a tool in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=114.06s)]
*  the toolbox, not the end all be all. We got to fix the broken trade system. But [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=118.58s)]
*  tariffs are a motivator to make these companies do the right thing. So [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=123.3s)]
*  tariff deals, I think they said 90 they're gonna try and do in several [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  months. It was like it's like warp speed in the vaccine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=129.98s)]
*  Let's start where we agree. Harold, why are you thinking? Why you are? Good to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=133.46s)]
*  talk to her like that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=137.22s)]
*  Harold looks like you got a little son. All right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=141.78s)]
*  All right, we'll start where we disagree that. Yeah. Harold and I would agree that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=144.86s)]
*  we need to confront China. No doubt you would agree that we need to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=149.42s)]
*  re industrialize the economy for the 21st century. High tech manufacturing. We [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=152.9s)]
*  agree. We agree. Do absolutely. You would agree that we want to get our trade [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=158.28s)]
*  partners to reduce their tariffs on our exports, correct? Correct. Okay. You [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=162.06s)]
*  would agree that we need rare earth minerals and we need abundant energy [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=167.1s)]
*  to fuel this modern economy without question. Okay, so that's where we [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=170.7s)]
*  agree. Donald Trump is the only one making progress on any of this. He's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=175.26s)]
*  the only one talking about it, and he's the only one getting results. He's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=179.7s)]
*  actually the first person to talk about how all these things come together [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  under one goal to make America great again. We've already gotten our eyes on [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=189.16s)]
*  the minerals in Ukraine, and we have our eyes on minerals in Greenland. We've [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=194.62s)]
*  gotten four trillion in private investment into this country on high [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=200.26s)]
*  tech manufacturing. We have companies racing to decouple from China, and 130 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=203.34s)]
*  allies have now said they're gonna drop their tariffs on our exports down to 10 [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=208.82s)]
*  percent. That's massive progress. Has it been perfect? No. But has it gotten [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  results? Absolutely. We could get a lot faster and better results if the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=221.1s)]
*  Democrats would cooperate. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. This is an [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=225.1s)]
*  American issue. So instead of just sitting around and complaining where [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=230.14s)]
*  your only idea is to do nothing, that's just gonna isolate the Democratic Party [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  because once this thing starts going and Trump's proven to be flexible, he has [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=239.5s)]
*  carve outs, he's watching the bond market, he says we might need to help [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  Detroit because even he understands you can't relocate major factories in a [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=247.7s)]
*  month. Could take a year, could take two or three. Why don't we reach across the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  aisle like you and I are right now, Harold? Shake hands and do this for the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=256.26s)]
*  American people together. All right, Harold, I guess you get to go next. Good [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=260.02s)]
*  to be here. Glad to be back around the table. Jesse, I'd love the way you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=263.62s)]
*  started out. I think one of the things that people in government should always [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=266.62s)]
*  do is lay out the things where they agree upon first and then let the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=270.26s)]
*  disagreements flow if there have to be. I don't disagree with anything you said [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=273.22s)]
*  about what we want for the country. I would probably we might quarrel over the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=276.5s)]
*  things we want to produce here. I think we ought to be producing the things that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=280.98s)]
*  help make robots, repair robots. We had to look forward where the economy is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=283.74s)]
*  gonna be in the next 10 to 15 years. One of the great, if not the greatest hockey [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=287.02s)]
*  player ever played a game, Wayne Gretzky, used to say you skate where the puck's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=290.1s)]
*  gonna be, not where it is. We should be our economic policy, industrial policy [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=293.18s)]
*  should be geared towards going where the country, where the world is going, which [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=297.38s)]
*  is why it's so interesting to me to watch how the president's conducting [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=301.86s)]
*  himself. This president comes to the job with more business experience, with more [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=304.7s)]
*  negotiating experience, with more success in that than anybody. And I think he [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=309.26s)]
*  would tell you the way you negotiate a deal successfully is to always have [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=313.18s)]
*  leverage. And if you don't have leverage, you make sure you find ways to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=317.26s)]
*  always be able to create leverage. When you think about our leverage as a country, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=320.5s)]
*  the strength of the United States, the reason so many countries want to do [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=324.46s)]
*  business here and to see their goods come here is because of the strength of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=327.9s)]
*  our consumers. 70% of our GDP is consumer resilience and consumer [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=330.74s)]
*  strength. As we sit here today, the numbers suggest that may be in decline. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=334.58s)]
*  However, some of the spending on the part of consumers suggests that consumers are [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=338.9s)]
*  spending still. We'll get some of the forward looking numbers going, numbers [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=343.06s)]
*  of April and May in the coming months. Two, we have rule of law. People in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=347.06s)]
*  business love it when they can depend and that their stability and how things [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  are going to be done. They like the fact that our dollars, the reserve currency, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=354.08s)]
*  the safe haven for the world. It looks as if it's not moving, it's not there, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=357.21999999999997s)]
*  but it doesn't seem to be exactly where we want it to be. And it's the role of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=361.29999999999995s)]
*  our national defense. I think as you look at today, I think the question we [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=363.98s)]
*  all have to answer and I think those watching have to answer more importantly, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=367.5s)]
*  the president and it's not Democrats and Republicans in Congress. This is the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=370.82s)]
*  president doing all the negotiating himself. The question is, do we have more [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=374.02000000000004s)]
*  leverage today than we did before Liberation Day? We talk about trillions [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  of dollars of opportunity for the country. We've lost $12 trillion in [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=383.06s)]
*  market cap wealth for our country. Some may dismiss that and say it's in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=386.38s)]
*  the little and that may be I don't I don't belittle it. I think that's a huge [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=390.34s)]
*  issue to the problem. The president, I think fundamentally has is we don't [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=393.14s)]
*  know what he wants on some days. It's fentanyl and drugs and human trafficking [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=397.02s)]
*  on some days. He wants a zero out of tariffs between between the two [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=401.14s)]
*  countries. The third time he sometimes he mentions we want less of a reliance [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=404.82s)]
*  on China. That's what I want. I think our whole plan about tariffs and trade [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=408.73999999999995s)]
*  ought to be organized. How do we rely less on China and China supply chains? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=413.78s)]
*  And finally, looks as if sometimes the president wants to zero out our trade [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=418.66s)]
*  imbalances with country. I think all of those things, they conflict at times and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=421.94s)]
*  it makes it more difficult to reach an endpoint. My advice to the president is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=425.66s)]
*  don't lose our leverage. If the American consumer gets weaker, if our biggest and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=429.62s)]
*  greatest companies are not as wealthy and as rich as they are today tomorrow [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=434.66s)]
*  than they are today, we have less of a chance him to go Shane the kinds of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=438.62s)]
*  deals we want with these countries going forward. But I like the fact that we [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=442.3s)]
*  agreed on the things we agreed on and let's figure out in the president ought [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=445.94s)]
*  to be doing that with not just Democrats, but with his own party. I would also [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=448.86s)]
*  suggest he do it with his own cabinet because some days Mr. Lutnick says [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=451.82s)]
*  things differently than Mr. Besson. Can we keep it going? All of this, you know, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=454.54s)]
*  camaraderie, Judge? Always, always. And I want to welcome Harold back from the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=459.22s)]
*  Masters. You're very kind. I went out for a day. And I'm wearing a green jacket [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=465.48s)]
*  for the Masters and Jesse has green in his side for the Masters. Look, I think [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=469.78s)]
*  that what the president is doing. Oh, and you have a green suit on Tyrus. I'm [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=474.02000000000004s)]
*  sorry. Oh, it's time for glasses for Dana. Yeah, it is great. I'm sorry. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=478.82s)]
*  He got mad because I didn't know it was great. Okay, look, the most important [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=487.98s)]
*  thing is bringing back manufacturing to the United States. And I don't know, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=491.34000000000003s)]
*  Harold, if you're suggesting that when you talk about AI that we have to look [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=495.42s)]
*  forward that there's something wrong with bringing manufacturing back to the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=499.42s)]
*  United States. I'm hoping I didn't misunderstand. I mean, the jobs we want [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=503.1s)]
*  to bring back are not the assembly jobs of iPhones, but it's how do you make [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=506.62s)]
*  robots and AI? That's what I meant. That's what I meant. Which is why you've [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=509.94s)]
*  got people like Sean Fain and the UAW saying we as Democrats, we support the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=513.9s)]
*  president in this endeavor. And you know what? The president could have a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=519.5400000000001s)]
*  multifaceted motivation here. He wants to get rid of fentanyl. He wants to make [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=523.4200000000001s)]
*  sure that we stop the killing of innocent Americans because China is [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=528.72s)]
*  sending the precursor to fentanyl to Mexico where they're stamping it and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=533.48s)]
*  selling it into the United States. And he can also have a motivation of less [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=537.1600000000001s)]
*  reliance on China, which, as we saw during Covid was, I don't want to have [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=541.24s)]
*  to rely on China for mass or for medication. I want medicines in this [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=545.6s)]
*  country being made here. So the idea that, you know, you're not sure what his [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=550.2s)]
*  motivation is, there's a whole panoply of motivations as to why we need to get [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=553.82s)]
*  everything back to the United States so we can maintain an independence. And by [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=558.7800000000001s)]
*  the way, we are the greatest economic power in the world. We are the greatest [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=563.7s)]
*  consumer base in the world. And I know that we lost some money, but we're going [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=567.9000000000001s)]
*  to get that money back. I don't think there's any question about it. And I [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=571.58s)]
*  think that the only reason that the Democrats had not sued, and believe me, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=574.94s)]
*  they sue about everything. They sue about immigration and they sue about all [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=578.58s)]
*  the other stuff. But there was an interesting article in the Wall Street [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=583.6600000000001s)]
*  Journal. If Democrats genuinely opposed tariffs, they could file lawsuits to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=586.62s)]
*  stop them, but they're not doing that. I think in the end, what we've got is a [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=592.22s)]
*  president who's got the backbone and the spine to negotiate or renegotiate shows [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=597.14s)]
*  that he is willing to put his political leverage so that we can regain our [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=604.58s)]
*  standing on the world stage. And all this namby pamby, we may lose this and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=609.14s)]
*  we may lose that, is not part of his game. His game is I'm making America [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=613.3s)]
*  first. I know how to do it. I've got the backbone to do it. No one else did it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=618.5s)]
*  And I'm going to get it done. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=622.74s)]
*  Tyrus, it was weird to me to have MSNBC asking like a left wing organization of [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=625.06s)]
*  the UAW why they would support Trump when the tariffs are a left wing agenda [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=630.14s)]
*  item. So why don't they just embrace it? And also he said today he's considering [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=635.14s)]
*  temporary exemptions from his 25% tariffs on the auto industry. So they could [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=639.26s)]
*  actually win on both sides of it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=643.98s)]
*  Well, the first part of your question, it doesn't matter what President Trump does. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=645.5400000000001s)]
*  MSNBC, he can literally come out with a vow that says the cure for cancer right [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=649.9s)]
*  here. And they will say that was a glass vow. And it was bad to you using glass [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=654.22s)]
*  and not using plastic. That's the issue. We're taking advice. You have to respect [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=658.78s)]
*  the process. This is a process. This is a negotiation. I'd just like to point out [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=664.6999999999999s)]
*  there was six agreements and a handshake between a Republican and Democrat [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=669.62s)]
*  probably the first time in four years. Congratulations. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=673.42s)]
*  We have to respect the process. The people who are criticizing, there is no honor [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=678.3399999999999s)]
*  and respect among thieves. We had four years of fleecing of this country. China [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=682.3399999999999s)]
*  had four years to make their move and they did. The problem was they didn't [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=686.42s)]
*  anticipate they were going to have to deal with President Trump again. Now he's [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=689.5s)]
*  back into what Harold was talking about. There's everywhere. Fentanyl is a giant [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=692.5s)]
*  pie. And China's been eating all the pie. Fentanyl is on one side, economic stuff [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  is on the other side, and we have to punch them in the mouth because China's [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=700.3000000000001s)]
*  goal was to get what? World currency. They didn't want the dollar bill to be the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=702.38s)]
*  world currency. They wanted China to be the world currency. And that was their [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=705.62s)]
*  agenda. So there was a lot of angles to this because he's behind four years to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=708.58s)]
*  trying to catch up. So respect the process. And when you have people on TV [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=712.5400000000001s)]
*  who put their hands on their face like, why are you doing this? That means they [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=717.0600000000001s)]
*  have no clue what they're talking about. Respect the process. There was hard [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=719.5s)]
*  times put on this country and you got to get through hard times. You're gonna [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=723.34s)]
*  have growing pains. It's gonna hurt a little bit, but I feel confident the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=726.38s)]
*  people that everywhere I go, people feel comfortable, feel good. We would rather [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=730.02s)]
*  go down swinging than sit like we did for the last four years. We were doing [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=733.46s)]
*  pretty doggone well four years ago that Canada and Mexico thing. The president [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=740.34s)]
*  wants to renegotiate. He was the one that negotiated that deal back in his [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=744.1s)]
*  first term. He renegotiated. I love you, but when you say we were doing well, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=747.74s)]
*  everywhere I travel, I never, I didn't feel people doing well. Don't get me [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=751.3s)]
*  wrong. We can be doing better. But the reality is we are $12 trillion poor [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=755.14s)]
*  today than we were on liberation. And we're gonna regain that money when the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=759.54s)]
*  manufacturing and the businesses come back to the United States. That isn't [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=763.54s)]
*  temporary move right now. That a temporary situation. Can I borrow the jacket? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=767.46s)]
*  Remember those algebra problems where there's a train going this fast and [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=773.74s)]
*  this and then the other train is gonna come this way? You have businesses that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=777.66s)]
*  have to plan and they're hurting right now. And like mid-sized ones that import [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=781.18s)]
*  things. They're like I'd love to manufacture it, but I can't create eight [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=786.14s)]
*  different machines and there are $220,000 in debt in a week. So now they know [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=789.4599999999999s)]
*  how it's felt for the everyday John Deere. Yeah, for the last four years. When they put all the money into the society. But that's not why you make it more [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=793.98s)]
*  difficult for small business owners because that's not the American way. She was a veteran small business owner. She's not somebody who was laying around. She's not a DEI. No, and in fact she was not. Anyway, I remain a skeptic. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdQC6dXlQw&t=803.54s)]
