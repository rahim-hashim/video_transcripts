# 'The Five': College students hold anti-Israel rallies across America
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc)
*  So now you have left-wing college students all across America holding a national day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=0.0s)]
*  of resistance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=7.16s)]
*  The anti-Israel rally showing a shocking display of indifference toward the victims in southern [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=8.72s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=14.16s)]
*  This after Hamas terrorists murdered women and children. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=15.32s)]
*  If anyone would like to cover their face, do indicate that and we will give you an N95 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  mask. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=26.16s)]
*  On Saturday, October 7th, the Palestinian resistance and occupied Palestine locked in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=27.16s)]
*  resistance operation by the name of Aqsa Flour across land, air and sea. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=31.76s)]
*  The Palestinian resistance has broken free from their cage in Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=38.16s)]
*  Hamas are Palestinians, okay? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=41.76s)]
*  All of us Hamas. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=45.36s)]
*  Resistance is justified when people are occupied. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Resistance is justified when people are occupied. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  So there is one side of it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=55.08s)]
*  Now here's another. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=57.28s)]
*  Journalist Barry Weiss calling out the cowardice in America's universities like you just saw. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=58.28s)]
*  You go and look at the Instagram or the Twitter of many of the most prestigious and celebrated [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=63.04s)]
*  so-called institutes of higher education in this country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=70.4s)]
*  You'll see posts about sustainability week. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=74.44s)]
*  You will not see posts about the greatest slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=77.7s)]
*  Tells you something about how deep the ideological rot is. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=85.9s)]
*  So I think it was Britt Hume last night who said a lot of rocks are being turned over [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  in America as we speak and I think he's right about that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=97.22s)]
*  Dana, we were on the air this morning on Newsroom. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=100.14s)]
*  We were talking about the complicated history of this part of the world and the fact that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=102.66s)]
*  you have to spend a lot of time to learn it and you said and if you don't learn it, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=105.66s)]
*  you're ignorant about it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=110.74s)]
*  Right, I mean it's purposeful because right now there's, we've talked about this before, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=111.74s)]
*  if you want to be educated on any topic of the world there's no better time to be alive [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=117.86s)]
*  because a lot of things you can actually learn for free. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=121.5s)]
*  You don't even have to go to university. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=124.06s)]
*  Pick up any podcast. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=125.62s)]
*  I'll give you a list of all the things I've been listening to this week and it did take [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=126.62s)]
*  effort and time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=130.04s)]
*  I didn't know a lot about the Middle East and the complications of the region before [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=131.04s)]
*  9-11. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  I had to learn that afterwards and I watched documentaries. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  I read books. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  I listened to podcasts. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  I started reading, especially the Wall Street Journal editorial page which helped me a lot. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  So there is that but I also think that this is not a new situation, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=146.48s)]
*  So it's not just like all of a sudden the freshman class of 2023 is this left-wing nut. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=151.44s)]
*  Actually this has been going on for quite a long time, maybe a few decades and so then [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=158.48s)]
*  you have the institutions at the universities at the highest levels somehow conflicted for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=163.32s)]
*  the most part. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  I wouldn't say all of them but for the most part. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  The other thing about these young people that are all, you know, rhyming and feeling good [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  about themselves, if they were in Israel, if they were citizens of Israel, what they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=176.66s)]
*  would be doing today is not putting on an N95 mask, they'd be putting on a uniform because [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=181.48s)]
*  they would have been called up to defend their country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=186.32s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=188.6s)]
*  After 9-11 I spent a lot of time with the looming tower trying to understand El-Qaeda. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=189.6s)]
*  Harold, you work in the world of finance. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=193.48s)]
*  What do you think about what's happening in Harvard when you have a reaction from a dozen [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=196.76s)]
*  CEOs who are backing Bill Ackman who is huge in the financial world here in New York not [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=200.6s)]
*  to hire anti-Israel students from Harvard University? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=206.14s)]
*  So the market is speaking. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=210.18s)]
*  Look, I believe everyone has a right to freedom of speech and everyone has a right to be wrong. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=211.44s)]
*  I think what I just saw there, the University of North Carolina students or if they were [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=216.72s)]
*  people on the campus, I don't know if they were students or not, but it's amazing to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=221.0s)]
*  me that someone would say, we are Hamas. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=224.68s)]
*  The second goal, the second stated purported goal of Hamas, their constitution is to destroy [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=226.56s)]
*  Israel, is to kill Jewish people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  So I don't understand how you could be for that and call yourself being part of some [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=237.08s)]
*  organizer resistance, but you asked me a basic question. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=244.0s)]
*  I think what my alma mater is the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=246.72s)]
*  One of our great graduates and friend of mine was on television this morning on another [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=250.84s)]
*  network calling for the senior leadership at Penn to resign because he felt that they [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=255.72s)]
*  had not denounced strongly, denounced let alone strongly enough some of this language. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=260.88s)]
*  Again, freedom of speech is a hallmark of our nation, but that does not prevent a university [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=267.52s)]
*  from denouncing what is occurring, what has occurred and what is occurring on their campuses. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=273.12s)]
*  We did it rightly so when we talked about issues affecting African Americans and black [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=279.08s)]
*  Americans after George Floyd's killing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=284.4s)]
*  This should absolutely be the case on every campus in the country where these kinds of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=287.56s)]
*  demonstrations are taking place. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=292.56s)]
*  And any president or leader that does not do it, I think they're not only going to face [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=294.32s)]
*  the peril of their graduates not getting jobs, but they're probably going to face the peril [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  of losing their own jobs. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  Quickly just to Greg and then Janine, what Harold's describing is a potential turning point. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  But it seems like in all a lot of big stories that we have, we predict turning points. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=309.72s)]
*  I'm not so sure that I'm convinced that this is one of them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, as long as the environment of academia, which is basically an assembly line for woke [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=317.88s)]
*  idiots keeps going like this, it will never end. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=323.16s)]
*  Who are they resisting anyway? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=326.72s)]
*  I mean, they're embraced by the professors and their peers. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=328.12s)]
*  I mean, academia is rife with that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  You remember after 9 11, there were stories of groups of radical Muslims celebrating the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  attack on NYC rooftops and there was no proof of that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  It ended up being an urban legend. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  Twenty years later, an urban legend is an urban reality, except it's not radical Muslims. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=344.92s)]
*  It's our own radicalized American students in masks endorsing terror. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  They are I mean, this is like incredible. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=356.68s)]
*  I mean, it speaks to this funhouse mirror of identity politics that twists and perverts [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  all logic. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=363.72s)]
*  It's a mind virus that turns average people into vile cretins. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=364.72s)]
*  Janine, you know, I like to think it's a turning point and hopefully I'm not being naive here. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  But what Bill Ackman is doing and what he is sending a message to the community, to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=376.88s)]
*  the financial community. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=383.36s)]
*  And I you know, I wonder where Jamie Dimon is. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=385.36s)]
*  I wonder where a lot of these other leaders are, the capitalists in our society. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=387.88s)]
*  But what they're doing is they're basically saying, look, we have an obligation to the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=392.8s)]
*  shareholders, to the board of directors, to the stakeholders, whatever, to have people [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=399.64s)]
*  of character and common sense as employees. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=405.36s)]
*  And if you're going to be focused on your microaggression, if you need a corner to cry [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=409.8s)]
*  And if you're a wuss, we don't want you in our company. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=415.0s)]
*  Pretty pretty great. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=418.44s)]
*  You are you're you are not someone that we want. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=419.44s)]
*  And hopefully this is the moment that these people will recognize that they can't start [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=422.24s)]
*  trashing people whose whose babies are taken out of their stomach and stabbed. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  And then the mother is shot. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=433.0s)]
*  All right. I know it's horrible, but they need to hear this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=434.24s)]
*  And they want to say that they're the oppressors. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  You know what? Get a life. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=439.44s)]
*  See what wants to kill and destroy the state of Israel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  This is not calling someone and want to go to work. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=443.92s)]
*  This is calling someone who wants to extinguish. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=446.24s)]
*  A group of people, they're saying is from the river to the sea, meaning the Jordan River [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=449.6s)]
*  to the Mediterranean. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKBFfUQtSc&t=453.52000000000004s)]
