**Fox News - The Five:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U)
*  I'm mostly enjoying Amy Coney Barrett, just bench slap Justice Jackson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=0.0s)]
*  In their brilliantly academic way, they're all calling her a nitwit. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=8.68s)]
*  And we knew she was a nitwit because she couldn't define what a woman was. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=13.84s)]
*  But they're basically saying you're not, in your dissents, grounding any of your arguments [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=17.6s)]
*  in case law. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  You're just making stuff up. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=25.12s)]
*  And every other justice agrees that this woman is just not qualified. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=28.16s)]
*  And you look back at the Biden legacy, he gave us Kamala Harris and he gave us Justice [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=34.04s)]
*  Jackson. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=38.24s)]
*  And you got to look and say, wow, what a bad move. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGX6tnbM2U&t=39.24s)]
