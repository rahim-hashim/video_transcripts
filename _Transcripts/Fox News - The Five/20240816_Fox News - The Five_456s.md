# 'The Five': Agitators ready to disrupt DNC
**Fox News - The Five:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw)
*  anti-Israel agitators giving us a sneak peek of the chaos coming to the DNC. The Hamas-loving [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=0.0s)]
*  freaks crashing a New York Democrat rally for VP Harris, brawling with cops, lotting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=20.18s)]
*  smoke bombs while storming an after party in Harlem. They also infiltrated a Biden-Harris [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=24.72s)]
*  event yesterday and heckled Joe Biden when he was speaking. Watch this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=29.84s)]
*  Martha, this is like that itch that you just can't scratch. They can't get rid of it. You're [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=33.84s)]
*  going to be at the DNC. How do you think this will impact their convention? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=56.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, unless they can get inside and have credentials, you know, it's very tough to get [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=60.64s)]
*  in these. At the Republican convention, they did the same thing in Milwaukee. They figured out a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=67.68s)]
*  way to keep them at a very, at a huge distance, essentially, saying that it was going to create [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=71.64s)]
*  a safety hazard in the city. And they managed to keep them really far away. And I think, I mean, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=77.6s)]
*  that's the battle that's going on right now because these protest groups are going before [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=83.12s)]
*  the city and saying that they are stepping on their first amendment, that they have a right to be [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  heard by the people coming and going from the convention. So that's a battle that the city has [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=90.32s)]
*  to sort of wage. Obviously, the people of Chicago have had successful conventions. They also have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=96.56s)]
*  the memory of 1968 in their deep memory well as well. And my guess is that they're going to keep [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=101.52s)]
*  them at a distance. But what's going to be really interesting is if somebody gets inside, if they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=108.8s)]
*  get inside the building and they start to cause havoc there, it could be an issue. But I think it's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=112.76s)]
*  at the voting booth that it's really going to be something that they're going to have to contend [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  with in a more meaningful way. Obviously, Kamala Harris has tried to walk this fence very carefully. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=120.12s)]
*  And I don't know how successfully at this point. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  Jessica, that's really the question. She talked about how they also showed up for Republicans. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=128.8s)]
*  They are rebuking Biden and Harris, but are Biden and Harris rebuking them enough? Is there a place [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=133.56s)]
*  for these people at the DNC? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=138.12s)]
*  Yeah, half a mile away. That's where they've been relegated to. They've shown themselves to be [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=140.72s)]
*  unsafe. This doesn't qualify as peaceful protest, or at least what we've seen in the past. Some of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=147.24s)]
*  the campus protests that they said were so peaceful, kids were beaten up. Jewish kids were [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=151.52s)]
*  prohibited from going into libraries, going into cafeterias, going into their dorm rooms. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=156.04s)]
*  Lawsuits now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=159.28s)]
*  Yeah. These people, they say, we want to be heard. We've heard you. And the administration with the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=159.96s)]
*  rest of the free world is working as hard as they can towards a ceasefire that also returns the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=166.4s)]
*  hostages. None of this would have happened if they hadn't shown up and killed over a thousand [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  people and taken hundreds of people hostage. And now they're starting fights online with black and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=176.28s)]
*  Latino voters demeaning what issues are the most important to them saying to young black women, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  oh, well, you know, this is more important than anyone's right to have reproductive health care. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=188.52s)]
*  This is more important than climate change. This is more important than gun reform, just [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=193.6s)]
*  denigrating people. And people on the last nerve, I was on the Jewish women for Kamala call last [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  night. And this was a major theme of it that they feel as though the Democratic Party and the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  perception of it has been co-opted from such a small fringe minority that has nothing to do with [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=207.28s)]
*  how our leadership feels, how Jewish liberals feel about our country and how they feel about [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  Israel and Netanyahu. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=216.88s)]
*  But she doesn't shut them down. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  She did. What remember they showed up when she was speaking. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=220.0s)]
*  She said, let me speak. I'm speaking. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=222.36s)]
*  She dignified them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  She didn't say we support Israel in this country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=225.28s)]
*  And October 7th is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=227.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=229.44000000000003s)]
*  So two squad members have already been defeated. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=230.96s)]
*  I don't know any others will. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  But is this a moment where Republicans take a step back and kind of let the left eat itself? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=234.96s)]
*  Yeah. Let them let them go at it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=239.16000000000003s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=240.8s)]
*  First of all, as it relates to Chicago, Chicago has the largest Palestinian population in the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=242.28000000000003s)]
*  country. Most of us think it's in Michigan or Minnesota. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=248.24s)]
*  No, it's in Cook County. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=251.24s)]
*  So right there, you've got one hundred thousand planned to come from one hundred and fifty [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  different organizations. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=257.6s)]
*  My understanding is that permits have been granted, but that there are restrictions on the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=259.12s)]
*  permits. And I think, you know, that that's where the problem is going to come. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=263.6s)]
*  Hopefully they are, as Jessica says, a half a mile away. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, they have the First Amendment right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  But it's got to be balanced against safety and security for everybody else. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  But to me, the most curious part of this issue is how they see Kamala and Biden. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=278.12s)]
*  On the one hand, they know that Joe Biden is the guy who freed up or opened up 80 [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=283.8s)]
*  million dollars in oil sales. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=289.44s)]
*  So Iran can then fund Hamas and all these other organizations and that Iran was [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=291.76s)]
*  broke under Trump. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=297.56s)]
*  So on the one hand, I mean, if they've got any smarts, they know that that that they're on [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=299.32s)]
*  their side. But on the other hand, you know, they've got this this other issue as to, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=303.6s)]
*  you know, Joe Biden and Kamala. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=308.4s)]
*  And this is where she's got to do that dance, separating herself from Biden, which I [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  don't know how she's going to do. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=314.48s)]
*  Joe Biden is sending armaments to to Israel. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=316.52s)]
*  But she said, if you want Donald Trump to win, you know, then keep talking. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=320.24s)]
*  And she shut them up. So I'm not quite sure how they see her. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=325.2s)]
*  And that's what's going to come out at this convention. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=329.0s)]
*  Greg, you know, the squad only existed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=331.76s)]
*  We know what the squad is because they became powerful enough. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=333.48s)]
*  Five or six members of Congress. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  And this is a group that they pandered to. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=337.32s)]
*  So the idea that Democrats can just wash their hands of these people doesn't really carry [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=339.16s)]
*  water with me. Yeah, I'm not sure there's that much daylight between these protesters [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=343.12s)]
*  and some of the people in the room. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=348.6s)]
*  I mean, just ask Josh Shapiro. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=350.16s)]
*  Yeah, he's not in the room because of the squad. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=352.32s)]
*  And the protesters were probably really happy that they ditched him because he was a Jew [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=355.68s)]
*  or is a Jew. You know, when you split people into groups, you end up with a lot of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=359.68s)]
*  ultimately pitting them against each other because you sacrifice the uniqueness of an [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  individual. Here's a person named Steve. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=367.76s)]
*  But then you turn him into Steve, a member of LGBTQ. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=370.92s)]
*  And all of a sudden you have the demands of a group and a group that tells people that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=375.36s)]
*  they are special as opposed to unique. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=380.76s)]
*  So that's what when you were talking about what's happening on these, these groups are [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  turning on each other because that's the natural evolution of these things. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=387.6s)]
*  If you tell a group that they're special, then they're going to be more special than the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=392.2s)]
*  other group. Patriotism or religion. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=396.24s)]
*  They said you were unique. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=398.6s)]
*  They didn't say you were special. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=400.12s)]
*  Right. And that's what you're seeing right now. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=402.2s)]
*  And I think, you know, it might be ugly there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=404.12s)]
*  It might be ugly. I'm glad I'm not going. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=408.2s)]
*  One benefit of being a Republican, those aren't your brats. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=411.0s)]
*  You know, we crack the whips. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, we know how to be an adult. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=417.68s)]
*  It's like being at a restaurant and your kids are well behaved and you look over and you [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=420.24s)]
*  see their kids and they're screaming and yelling. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  You go like, my God, it's not the kids, it's the parents. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=426.6s)]
*  Democrats got to discover their inner adult. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  Jessica, whip out those iPads. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=433.04s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=435.0s)]
*  Do you think it matters that her husband is Jewish? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=437.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think it does matter a lot. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=440.12s)]
*  And we do have to talk about this. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but that's interesting. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  That's an interesting piece. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRDb0ACF3uw&t=446.20000000000005s)]
