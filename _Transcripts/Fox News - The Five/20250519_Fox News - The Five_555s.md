# Gutfeld roasts Hillary Clinton: 'ASSIGNED OPINION'
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs)
*  Well, the losers of Democrats pass, refuse to go quietly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=0.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton and Tim Walz are back, not with solutions for the country or their party, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=4.16s)]
*  but with a full-blown case of TDS. Kamala has failed, kicking things off using a college [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=8.64s)]
*  graduation speech to smear ICE agents with a truly despicable comparison. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=13.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's modern-day Goscapo is scooping folks up off the streets. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=19.76s)]
*  They're in unmarked vans, wearing masks, being shipped off to foreign torture dungeons. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=24.64s)]
*  No chance to mount a defense, not even a chance to kiss a loved one goodbye, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=29.52s)]
*  just grabbed up by masked agents, shoved into those vans, and disappeared. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=33.6s)]
*  Not to be outdone, Hillary Clinton is also running her mouth about the popular border [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=38.72s)]
*  policies of the man who beat her by mocking traditional American families. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  This very blatant effort to basically send a message, most exemplified by Vance and Musk [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=47.92s)]
*  and others, that what we really need from you women are more children. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=54.8s)]
*  Which is sort of odd because the people who produce the most children in our country are [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=59.68s)]
*  immigrants and they want to deport them. So none of this adds up. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=63.92s)]
*  First of all, don't be a handmaiden to the patriarchy, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=67.52s)]
*  which kind of eliminates every woman on the other side of the aisle, except for very few. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=74.64s)]
*  Hmm. All right, Greg, you want to talk about the Giustapo first? Or what? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=81.6s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I could talk about Tim Walz. Why do people like Walz only communicate through [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  commencement addresses? Right? Not podcasts. It's because they can only recite their boilerplate [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  opinions in arenas where there's no risk of a follow-up question. It's why J.D. Vance just [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=102.16s)]
*  mopped the floor with him when he actually was faced with someone asking him stuff. The moment [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=108.56s)]
*  you say, what do you mean by that? Or do you have proof that they're like the Giustapo? They will [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  implode. This is why lefties always get all the commencement addresses and they love to spout [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=117.12s)]
*  their opinions on award shows because they know there's no journalist there that will ask them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=123.04s)]
*  a question. And the reason why, and he's the perfect example, none of their opinions are [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=127.36s)]
*  actually real. They're all assigned. So he has, there's just a folksy glibness, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=134.48s)]
*  but underneath it, there is nothing. And they never have to have that challenge because the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  people around them never say, hey, what do you mean by that? There is no contemplation. You can [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=147.92s)]
*  always tell when somebody's telling you something that is not their own opinion. You do it all the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=153.92s)]
*  time, Jesse. You know what's a perfect example? A perfect example is like me insulting Nickelback. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=157.6s)]
*  And I've never heard their songs, but I make fun of Nickelback, but it's only because I've heard [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=167.04s)]
*  other people make fun of it. That's an assigned opinion. You look at Hillary, she uses the phrase, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=172.0s)]
*  what was it? I wrote it down here. Handmaiden to the patriarchy, which I think she means she's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  bashing Monica Lewinsky. I'm not sure, but this only is appealing to an ever shrinking circle of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=183.28s)]
*  feminist women, the same who bow to the altar of trans men and keep silent when real women are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=189.44s)]
*  victimized by really bad men. But again, it's another assigned opinion that's lazily presented [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=194.88s)]
*  men against women, whether it's race or gender, as long as you pit one group against the other, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=200.8s)]
*  they won't look up at you. And this is how the Democrat party survives is they want everybody [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=206.56s)]
*  to fight each other over their specific group rather than fight over an idea. Because once you [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=211.68s)]
*  look at the ideas, you leave the party. Right. And if you are in a group that they think should [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  vote for Democrats and you stray away, Sandra, then you get this kind of treatment. I mean, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=224.16s)]
*  does Hillary Clinton want to comment on Susie Wiles, who was the first female chief of staff, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=228.88s)]
*  the very pro mother administration that the Trump administration has put into place that President [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump has hired all these young women to work for him who are doing a great job on the merits? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  For her to say you can't be holding the hand of the patriarchy was just a shot at any woman who [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=242.08s)]
*  decides she doesn't want the same path as Hillary. What stuck out to me was the eliminating women [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  comment as I interviewed the father of a seventh grader today, a seventh grade girl who was put [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  out of metal contention running in her 200 meter race on the track against a biological boy. And [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=258.08s)]
*  it took this suburban father to take to the national airwaves to bring attention to the matter [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=265.12s)]
*  because people like Hillary Clinton are not as far as Tim Walz is concerned. He's got a captive [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=271.04s)]
*  audience when it comes to the graduation speeches. I mean, if we're up to him, I think we'd see him [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=276.32s)]
*  all over the place. I think Democrats might be holding back on him. But if you look at the last [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=280.8s)]
*  election and you look at the response he gets when he gets out there, Republicans should probably be [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  happy that he keeps himself out there in the forefront. But Hillary Clinton's words, I got [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  me today talking to watching that girl not be able to get a third place finish because she has to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=295.36s)]
*  race against a boy. Katie, I'm just getting word from the producers. Tim Walz has stage four jazz [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=299.2s)]
*  hands. Oh wow. I heard that's lethal. Yes. Jesse, don't you just love paying tens of thousands of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  dollars for your kid to go to college and then you go to the graduation finally and you get a lecture [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=312.0s)]
*  like this? Isn't it just the best? Yeah, I mean, I could, I'd fall asleep with Tampon talk to me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=316.32s)]
*  And he won't. I've invited him on like twice and he still's dodging. Bummer. So Tampon's career is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=321.36s)]
*  over, Katie. You can't call ICE agents Nazis. That is a career ender. Federal law enforcement [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=327.6s)]
*  officials are Nazis. And this is coming from the guy that had a COVID snitch line. This is coming [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=334.48s)]
*  from the guy that fantasizes over communist China, which is a little more in line with those other [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=339.92s)]
*  people that he mentioned. If you have a face tattoo and you have criminal convictions in this [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=346.0s)]
*  country and you're a foreign national and you get picked up, I don't want a lawyer. I don't want an [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  appeal. I want you adios. Goodbye. And if he thinks they should stay in here while they fight [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=356.4s)]
*  through the legal system, no, absolutely not. Now, Hillary, she thinks it's virtuous to have the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  entire third world in Latin America break through the border right before their water breaks and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=368.96s)]
*  then have a baby at an American hospital without health insurance and then just raise the kid in a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  hotel room in midtown while we pay for it. Absolutely not. We want more babies. Everybody [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  wants more babies because if you don't have them, it's basic arithmetic, Katie. You go bankrupt [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=385.36s)]
*  first and then the civilization collapses and all the policies the left's are pushing is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=390.56s)]
*  contributing to the decline of civilization, whether it's porn, cannabis, rapid urbanization, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=396.0s)]
*  rapid industrialization, high mortgage rates. All of these things are making it impossible [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=403.92s)]
*  to have children and raise children. I just feel bad for Chelsea Clinton. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=410.88s)]
*  That's who I think of mostly at these times. I'm sure you do. And Bill. She didn't choose to be born. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=415.76s)]
*  Yeah. All right. So, Carol, do you think it's time to say adios goodbye to Hillary and Tim? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=421.84s)]
*  Are you tired of talking about them? Like you're ready to move on to new people? I've been critical [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=427.68s)]
*  of my party over the last several months for the way we have handled the aftermath of the election. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=431.92s)]
*  Just as a juxtaposition, you look at several of the special elections that have been held since [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=439.68s)]
*  November, Democrats have fared somewhat well, I think largely because those Democrats running [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=444.4s)]
*  are actually in the country. You just recently had a mayor in Nebraska and Omaha, a Republican, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=449.44s)]
*  a Democrat beat them. They're not tapping into this Democratic message. The autopsy the Democrats [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=454.88s)]
*  need that lays out, that tries to lay out and determine why we lost, how we lost, no one has [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=460.0s)]
*  seriously done it at the federal level. So as a result, your free agents like Mr. Walts, and I [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=464.8s)]
*  say free agents, they're known political figures. Obviously, Senator Clinton is a known, Secretary [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  Clinton is a known political figure, but they're not saying things with any coordination or symmetry. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=474.08s)]
*  And for that matter, they don't sound as if they're really in touch with the things that happen. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=478.88s)]
*  You talked about the transgender athlete. That's an issue that we as Democrats, if we don't get [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=483.36s)]
*  serious about and realistic about and credible on, we're not going to be listened to on other issues [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=488.0s)]
*  that are credible and meaningful in people's lives. And until you understand where the path is [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=494.4s)]
*  and what the issues are, they're going to push us forward. You're going to continue to hear these [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=499.12s)]
*  voices, these free agent voices out here talking and really kind of a dastardly and frankly, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  unorganized and really ineffective way about the things that people care about. My advice, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=507.44s)]
*  if you can't do it at the federal level, the autopsy, at least listen to what those who are [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  winning in these special elections in the state races, the local races, what are they saying [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=515.92s)]
*  that's appealing to everyday Americans in a broad cross-section of the country? But until you get an [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=520.0s)]
*  autopsy, until you figure out and we all understand and get the painful lessons, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=525.6s)]
*  you're going to continue to show these kind of silly bits and not to sit up and respond to this. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=530.4s)]
*  I think that's good advice from Harold who would like you to move on. Thank you. All right. Up next, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=535.6s)]
*  Democrats are going ballistic over the big, beautiful bill and Americans are finally keeping [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=540.0s)]
*  more of their hard-earned cash. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xS8trcJnXs&t=544.56s)]
