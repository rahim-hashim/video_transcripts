# Jesse Watters: What do Democrats stand for?
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk)
*  It would be great if the Democrats would do what's right for our country for a change, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=0.0s)]
*  because they really are there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  They've lost their way. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=7.16s)]
*  Everything's transgender. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=8.6s)]
*  Everybody transgender. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  That's all you hear about. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Now, that's why we won the election in record numbers. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Everyone's transgender. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=17.0s)]
*  President Trump kicking a party while it's down, as Democrats face the grim reality that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=18.88s)]
*  their loss in the wilderness phase might turn into a permanent hiking trip. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=23.36s)]
*  You know what happens on hiking trips, Dana. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  Bill Maher confessing to Kid Rock that Joe Biden might be the last Democratic president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if we'll ever see a Democrat president again, because I just don't think [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=36.44s)]
*  they are of a mind that that can happen without it ruining the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=42.36s)]
*  So they convince themselves they have to do it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=48.0s)]
*  It's not just the presidency they risk losing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=52.32s)]
*  There's new signs that midterms aren't going to be a cakewalk. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  Democrats' own internal polling shows the party is losing trust in battleground districts [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=58.08s)]
*  and struggling to connect with independent voters, just 27 percent of whom believe Dems [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=62.2s)]
*  are focused on helping them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=67.64s)]
*  Fifty-six percent said Democrats are not looking out for working people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=69.44s)]
*  But the crusty old socialist thinks a dose of fear will help right the ship. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=73.24s)]
*  These are the scariest times in my lifetime. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=79.12s)]
*  That's all. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=82.8s)]
*  I mean, I think that's objectively the truth. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=83.8s)]
*  You know, it is not just they want to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut programs [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  for working people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=91.28s)]
*  You combine that with the power of the oligarchy in general. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=92.28s)]
*  You combine that with Mr. Musk owning Twitter. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  He is now trying to end what the Founding Fathers were pretty smart about, creating [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=102.44s)]
*  a form of government where there were checks and balances. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  What man sits under has his leg sitting under another leg. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  That's what's wrong with America. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=116.4s)]
*  But it couldn't be scarier than what this Democrat posted on her social media. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=118.28s)]
*  She looks like the lead singer of Jane's Addiction. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=134.72s)]
*  You guys wouldn't know that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=137.72s)]
*  All right, Harold, I have to go to you first because you are the resident Democrat here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=138.72s)]
*  You saw Bill Maher. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=144.36s)]
*  He seems very dejected. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=145.96s)]
*  It seems like every Democrat seems to be dejected except you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=148.96s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, good to be with you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  It's 60 days, a little less than 60 days into President Trump's presidency. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  He's doing a lot of the things he said he would do. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  He's created a sense of unsettledness around him that I think the president, to his credit, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=161.68s)]
*  is able to thrive in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  Democrats have to remember, there are a lot of Democrats who are students of just TikTok [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  and Instagram and X. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=174.24s)]
*  Nothing against any of those companies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  But you've got to go back a little bit. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=177.8s)]
*  I remember, and I've shared on this show, I didn't think when I was 18 or 19 years old [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=179.24s)]
*  the Democrats would ever win the presidency either. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  So I decided, I was fortunate my father was in Congress, he helped me get a job with a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=186.08s)]
*  guy named Louis Sullivan who was the Secretary of Health and Human Services for President [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=190.24s)]
*  Bush, H.W. Bush. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=193.84s)]
*  I remember him. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=194.84s)]
*  I wanted to work in the administration in the executive branch. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=195.84s)]
*  Lo and behold, three years later, this governor out of Arkansas who really spoke to and tried [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=198.64s)]
*  to personify and embody the things that Bill Maher is talking about and that others are [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=205.12s)]
*  talking about, or even some of the things that Bernie Sanders is talking about, understanding [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=208.44s)]
*  people, talking to people, understanding their pain. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=211.72s)]
*  He got mocked for some of those things. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  He emerged with an agenda. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=216.2s)]
*  It was moderate to the point that's been made around the table, how more Democrats want [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=218.04s)]
*  Democrats to be moderate, and I think independents do as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=221.62s)]
*  He went on to beat a president and President Bush who had some of the highest approval [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=224.88s)]
*  ratings in 1990 when General Storm and Norman Schwarzkopf kicked Saddam Hussein out of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=229.56s)]
*  Kuwait. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=236.16s)]
*  This is history. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=237.24s)]
*  The country rallied around Bill Clinton because of the economy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=239.76s)]
*  Democrats have to get back to common sense. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=243.6s)]
*  I think the most important thing President Trump says, and Jesse you say it a lot, Greg [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=245.44s)]
*  you say it a lot, everybody around the table says it a lot, is common sense things. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  We've got to get back to that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=253.84s)]
*  If we don't, Bill Maher may be right, but I'm 54 years old. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=256.6s)]
*  There's no way we're not going to have another Democratic president again. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=259.64s)]
*  I remember even when Obama was elected, people thought that demographics in the country would [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=262.16s)]
*  change and benefit Democrats so much. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=265.96s)]
*  Black Americans and Hispanic Americans would all rally. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=268.8s)]
*  What happened? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=271.68s)]
*  You had a guy named Donald Trump figure out a way to talk to those people and got more [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=272.68s)]
*  of their votes than Republicans have gotten in the past. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  I still have great optimism that the country is going to be great and Democrats will be [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=278.16s)]
*  a part of making it greater. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=281.88s)]
*  What I got from that, Harold, is that you're 54. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=283.4s)]
*  I'll be 55 in May, if this gets done. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=285.84s)]
*  You don't look a day over 56. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=291.84s)]
*  Is it the hair? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=292.84s)]
*  Yes, it's the hair. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=293.84s)]
*  You know, Dana, what Harold talks about is that, okay, so Clinton, he can talk to the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=294.84s)]
*  average citizen who lives in the real world. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  That was what he was known for. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=303.64s)]
*  I feel your pain. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=305.28s)]
*  When Harold says, basically, right now this party basically chose the wrong path. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=307.4s)]
*  The appeasement of activists who don't live in the real world. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=312.76s)]
*  How do you get out from that path at this point? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=316.28s)]
*  Well, I think that the fact that they were willing to put out their own terrible polling [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  as sort of maybe a shock to the system to let people know that even they see it or that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=325.12s)]
*  things are so bad that they were willing to do that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=330.0s)]
*  And that's all, of course, funded by Arabella advisors, which we've heard about before. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=332.96s)]
*  And they are certainly very, very liberal and they see the writing on the wall. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=337.12s)]
*  I saw a different poll today that I thought was worth bringing up just as an illustration [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=341.48s)]
*  of this point. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  John Ossoff is a senator from Georgia. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  He won in that race. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  He's up for reelection again in 2026. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  That's going to be a close one. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  Republicans should pick that one back up. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=355.36s)]
*  Now last week or last month, he was at 44-44 in the polling with a generic Republican, whoever [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=358.16s)]
*  it's going to be. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=364.48s)]
*  Then the pollster asked a follow up question. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  What if you knew that John Ossoff voted against protecting girls' sports from transgender [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=369.4s)]
*  males? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  How would you vote then? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  And it changes immediately to 52-38 for the generic Republican. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  So that's why you see some of this movement from the Democrats. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  I just don't know how you erase those votes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=385.64s)]
*  Like how, all of a sudden, are they going to have a change of heart? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  They have to be brave enough, Judge, to say, we don't want to be in bed with these activists [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=390.2s)]
*  anymore. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=395.79999999999995s)]
*  But they can't. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  They're too scared. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  It's amazing that they won't separate themselves from the progressives. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=399.2s)]
*  They have to understand, because everyone gets it, that it's because of the progressives [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=402.12s)]
*  that they lost the election. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=406.8s)]
*  Whether it's the progressive takeover or the influence, I'm not, I don't know what it is. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  But what you've got are, you've got the Democrat party that, you know, it's declined with voters. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  You read the stat right in the beginning that they don't respect work. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=418.92s)]
*  Well, if they don't respect work, how do they respect workers? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=421.8s)]
*  I mean, it's no surprise that the unions have gone for Trump. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=425.24s)]
*  But you know, one of the things that you said, Harold, was the ability to talk and the ability [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=429.48s)]
*  to talk to people. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=435.04s)]
*  I was thinking about that today, not with respect to this issue, but Donald Trump was [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=436.6s)]
*  talking about the war in Ukraine. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=441.16s)]
*  And he talked about the fact that they've got Ukraine to agree, and now they're working [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=443.76s)]
*  on Putin and Russia. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  And he said, I don't want any more dead men. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=448.32s)]
*  This is reminiscent, not that he was there, obviously, but it's almost like a civil war. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=452.8s)]
*  You know, what happened? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=457.92s)]
*  Just young men dying all over the place. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=459.36s)]
*  And it's the first time I heard a president talk about people dying with such passion. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=461.76s)]
*  Because presidents talk about the soldiers dying with such detachment that it doesn't [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=468.82s)]
*  connect. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=476.52s)]
*  He connects with people. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=477.52s)]
*  And the Democrats have, you know, they've got themselves on this moral pedestal. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=479.0s)]
*  You know, we know what you need to do, you know, to make a better America. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=483.2s)]
*  They don't live in the real world. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=487.48s)]
*  They don't live with the rest of us. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=489.14s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=490.76s)]
*  Speaking of simple, Jesse, the judge makes a good point about it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=492.6s)]
*  It seems like America is responding to clarity so that even when Trump says everyone's transgender, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=498.12s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=505.72s)]
*  But directionally, we understand exactly what he means. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=506.72s)]
*  Because in our culture, everywhere we looked, that was injected into every kind of cultural [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=509.44000000000005s)]
*  arena. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=515.64s)]
*  There it was. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=516.64s)]
*  And we were to accept it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=517.64s)]
*  Many people think you're transgender. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=519.88s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=521.24s)]
*  I've identified. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=522.24s)]
*  I changed my mind a lot. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=523.24s)]
*  I don't know what I am right now. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=524.24s)]
*  You asked the question about whether the Democrats are going to go extinct. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=527.88s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=530.6s)]
*  I'm not one of those people like you that think, oh, it's really healthy for the country. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=532.24s)]
*  If you have two strong parties, get out of here. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=537.16s)]
*  You said you think in the past. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=539.92s)]
*  You think it's good for the parties. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  I want to burn your village and steal your women. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=542.6s)]
*  Metaphorically speaking, I want one of those great stretches where it was like Reagan, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=546.88s)]
*  Reagan, Bush. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=551.92s)]
*  And if it wasn't for Ross Perot, it would have been 16 straight years. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=552.92s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  And that's what I expect. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=558.8399999999999s)]
*  And that doesn't mean I'm saying Red Wave. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=562.2s)]
*  Let's just be clear. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=563.2s)]
*  The Democrats right now are at a messaging retreat in Virginia. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=564.2s)]
*  They're just trying to trick you. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=569.72s)]
*  What do they stand for? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=571.08s)]
*  What do you stand for, Democrats? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=572.08s)]
*  Do you even stand for fighting climate change because you're torching Teslas and you stole [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=574.36s)]
*  all the money from the Green New Scam? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=578.88s)]
*  Those were the progressives. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=580.84s)]
*  Do you stand for education? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=581.84s)]
*  No, you shut the schools down and you don't even talk about test scores. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=584.24s)]
*  Do you stand for health? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=587.88s)]
*  Look at yourselves. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=590.08s)]
*  Obviously, you're not Maha. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=591.08s)]
*  Do you stand for border? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=592.96s)]
*  Do you stand for public safety? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=594.2s)]
*  Obviously not. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=596.0s)]
*  Do you stand for the middle class doing well? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=597.36s)]
*  No. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=600.4s)]
*  Bidonomics, cost of living. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=601.4s)]
*  You're okay with factories in China and Canada and Mexico. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=603.56s)]
*  You've done nothing about it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=606.68s)]
*  The Democrats don't stand for anything. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=608.2s)]
*  They don't even stand for progress. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=609.76s)]
*  You've said it, Greg. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=611.08s)]
*  They don't even stand for the flag. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=612.08s)]
*  They can't even build a reservoir. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=614.68s)]
*  Or a railroad or any electric charging station. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=616.24s)]
*  Greg, it is so bad. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=620.4s)]
*  They are making an 82-year-old woman look like Fraggle Rock and dance for donations. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  That is awful. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  Before we go, I think the analogy is the man sitting on his own leg. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=628.48s)]
*  How can you get up and do anything if you're sitting on your own leg? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=633.76s)]
*  His leg's going to fall asleep. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  No real man sits like that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=637.52s)]
*  And Bernie shouldn't be sitting like that either. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=639.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=641.72s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=642.72s)]
*  Public library? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=643.72s)]
*  It looks like a library. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=644.72s)]
*  You don't get off that guy's case. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=646.28s)]
*  Poor Bernie. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=648.28s)]
*  That's your party, America. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQiRsLqVQgk&t=649.28s)]
