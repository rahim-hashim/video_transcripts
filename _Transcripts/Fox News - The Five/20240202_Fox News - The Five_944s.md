# 'The Five' reacts to US retaliatory strikes against Iran proxy groups
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg)
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=0.0s)]
*  The United States has started carrying out a wave of retaliatory strikes in Iraq and [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=2.92s)]
*  Syria. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  It comes five days after a deadly drone attack launched by Iran-backed terror groups that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=8.72s)]
*  killed three American soldiers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=13.18s)]
*  Today was the dignified transfer of their remains. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Let's go right to national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=18.66s)]
*  She's got a live update from the Pentagon. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=21.42s)]
*  Hi, Jennifer. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=23.16s)]
*  Hi, Dana. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=24.16s)]
*  Well, at 4 p.m. Eastern, the USBN carrying out airstrikes on six to seven locations, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=25.16s)]
*  I'm told, in both Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=32.28s)]
*  The U.S. Central Command just put out a statement in which they said that 85 targets had been [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=35.32s)]
*  struck at those different locations that were used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=40.44s)]
*  125 munitions were dropped. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=46.36s)]
*  And we've heard from U.S. defense officials that two B-1B Lancer bombers flew from the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=50.28s)]
*  United States to the region and carried out some of these strikes, targeting, I'm told, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=56.28s)]
*  multiple, multiple targets inside these six to seven locations used by the Iranian proxies. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  Some of the locations were weapon storage facilities and included underground bunkers, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=71.04s)]
*  headquarters, command and control nodes that have been used for the Iranian-backed proxies [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=76.44s)]
*  to store their drones and ballistic missiles and fire on those U.S. bases, as we've reported, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=81.4s)]
*  166 attacks on U.S. bases since mid-October. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=88.8s)]
*  The one that turned deadly on Sunday, killing three Americans, was the trigger for this [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=93.48s)]
*  response. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=99.52s)]
*  We're told that this is a campaign that has been drawn up by U.S. Central Command, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=100.52s)]
*  that it will last for days, and that this is the first round, the first round of strikes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=104.88s)]
*  We reported at about 3.30 today that there were explosions inside Syria at some of these [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=111.0s)]
*  sites. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  We're told they weren't airstrikes at the time, but that they were explosions. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  It was part of the preparations being made for the strikes on these targets. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  So a little bit of confusion earlier today, but we know for certain that the first airstrikes [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=127.88s)]
*  began at 4 p.m. Eastern. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=132.18s)]
*  Dana? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Dana, can you come over here and take it around the table here? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=135.16s)]
*  Will, you want to go? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=136.16s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=137.16s)]
*  I know Jennifer asked this earlier today in speaking to the Pentagon, but how much heads [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=138.16s)]
*  up Iran had that these strikes were headed their way? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=140.96s)]
*  How much they were able to evacuate from the targets? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  And then what, if that is the fact, is what is left, from at least a personnel standpoint, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=147.52s)]
*  as who was actually the target in these strikes? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=152.56s)]
*  Well, Will, I think it's been the worst-kept secret in Washington that this campaign was [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=155.44s)]
*  going to begin in the coming days. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=161.0s)]
*  You heard the president talk about it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=163.42s)]
*  You've heard Pentagon officials talk about it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=164.74s)]
*  Yesterday here at the Pentagon, I asked Secretary Austin that very question. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=167.5s)]
*  Here was the question. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=172.18s)]
*  Has there been too much telegraphing, or is the point not to kill any Iranian commanders? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=173.18s)]
*  In terms of telegraphing about strikes and whether or not people leave or would have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=180.46s)]
*  speculate on any of that, I would just tell you that we will have a multi-tiered response. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=188.98s)]
*  So Will, I think it would be safe to assume that given the time of day when they struck, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=199.1s)]
*  after midnight local time, and the telegraphing that had taken place, we had seen reports [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=203.7s)]
*  that Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders had been called back to Iran. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=208.94s)]
*  I would be very surprised if any of them had been at these bases. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=213.26s)]
*  There may have been a few people left behind, but not the senior commanders. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=217.06s)]
*  And I think perhaps that was by design. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  Again, you've heard the Pentagon and others say that they're not seeking a war with [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=223.62s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=227.34s)]
*  That's why U.S. officials are ruling out any strikes inside Iran at this time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=228.34s)]
*  But again, this is the first salvo. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=233.62s)]
*  They're hoping that Tehran gets the message without this having to escalate. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=235.38s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=239.38s)]
*  Judge Pirro? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=240.38s)]
*  You know, Jennifer, I understand that the United States is saying they're not seeking [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=241.38s)]
*  a war, but at the same time, there are those who believe that if you just hit the proxies [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=245.1s)]
*  in Syria and Iraq, that it's not going to matter to Iran. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  And that when Iran can separate itself from the proxies, saying, you know, they go rogue, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=254.7s)]
*  when the truth is the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps both trains them and pays them, you [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=261.18s)]
*  know, it's kind of disingenuous. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=267.26s)]
*  And then what is the point of our hitting the proxies? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=268.96s)]
*  Well, it's a very good question. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=271.9s)]
*  And certainly this shell game that Iran has been playing in the Middle East by arming [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=274.22s)]
*  and supporting and training these proxies, whether it's in Lebanon with Hezbollah, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=279.06s)]
*  whether it's these various groups in Syria and Iraq, whether it's the Houthis in Yemen, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=284.26000000000005s)]
*  whether it's Hamas in the Gaza Strip, there is a common thread here, and it is Iran and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=288.46000000000004s)]
*  it is Tehran. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=293.38000000000005s)]
*  And the U.S. has not figured out a way to put enough pressure on Iran to make it painful [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=294.82000000000005s)]
*  enough for them to stop supporting these groups. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=300.0s)]
*  And in fact, there are some who believe—and this is why it's a very delicate balancing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=303.98s)]
*  act for the White House national security team as well as the Pentagon—is how not [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=307.86s)]
*  to get baited into a war with Iran, because some believe that's what Iran wants, that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=312.64s)]
*  they wanted Israel to find itself in a war with Hamas and for the U.S. to, you know, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  stumble into a larger conflict. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  And so, that's what people are trying to avoid. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=328.68s)]
*  But they also believe that by striking 85 targets, as well as, you know, a days-long, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=330.66s)]
*  if not weeks-long, campaign, that they can ratchet up the pressure on Iran. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=338.38000000000005s)]
*  They're going to lose a lot of valuable property that their proxies have been using [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=342.62s)]
*  to torment and taunt U.S. bases for the last three months. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=347.8s)]
*  The question one should ask is, what took so long? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=352.82000000000005s)]
*  Of course, it's tragic that three Americans were killed, but the U.S. troops sitting in [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=356.68s)]
*  Iraq and Syria have been sitting ducks for months now. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=362.48s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=365.2s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin, thank you so much. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=366.2s)]
*  We want to get to Mike Tobin. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=367.74s)]
*  He's in Israel and Tel Aviv. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=368.74s)]
*  He's got the latest with reaction there, as I'm sure that they are on heightened [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=370.12s)]
*  alert as well. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=373.8s)]
*  No, they're always on heightened alert at this stage, Dana. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=374.8s)]
*  And what I can really confirm for you right now are just some of the locations. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=378.64s)]
*  We have a source inside of Iraq who says, indeed, there have been multiple targets struck [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  in the area of Al Qaim, which is at the western border of Iraq, very near Syria. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  And this following reports throughout the day that the El-Mayadeen, the Deir-Azour area, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=390.66s)]
*  the Abu Kamal area were all hit. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  And these are areas that are kind of near the, some of those cities are just on the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=399.88s)]
*  banks of the Euphrates River. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=403.76s)]
*  Al Qaim is immediately across the border. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=405.36s)]
*  So a lot of the real estate, at least where a lot of the strikes have been concentrated, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=407.94s)]
*  is not a whole lot of real estate concentrated into about a 60-mile area. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=411.14s)]
*  We know that there were other strikes inside of Iraq, the U.S. confirming today that there [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=415.8s)]
*  were some 85 different targets hit by some 125 different munitions. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=419.8s)]
*  And that is dramatically different from the early reports we heard that some eight different [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=425.5s)]
*  targets were hit. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=428.88s)]
*  We anticipated that the numbers would change, and indeed they did change, as the U.S. is [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=430.2s)]
*  now confirming that they used two of those big B-1B bombers to hit some of those targets [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=434.04s)]
*  inside of Iraq. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  Dana? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=439.34000000000003s)]
*  Mike, we're going to take it on the table. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  Richard has a question, but let me just quickly ask you, there was talk earlier this week [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  that there was communication about a possible ceasefire in order to get more hostages out. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=445.24s)]
*  Do you know where that stands at this moment? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=451.56s)]
*  It stands at the point where Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials met, and they set out a number [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  of their demands. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=460.82s)]
*  They said you're going to need to see a massive prisoner release. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  They want to see all Israelis withdraw from the Gaza Strip and a cessation of combat inside [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=465.32s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=473.52s)]
*  They also want to see some restoration, rebuilding for all the destruction that was done inside [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=474.52s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=478.28s)]
*  So you have very broad demands, if you will, coming from the leadership of Palestinian, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  Islamic Jihad and Hamas as far as a prisoner release goes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=484.35999999999996s)]
*  And that puts them very far apart from Benjamin Netanyahu, who says they want to see all of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=488.34s)]
*  the prisoners released and Hamas dismantled. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=493.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=495.0s)]
*  Richard? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=496.0s)]
*  Thanks for joining us, Mike. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=497.0s)]
*  Now, picking up where Dana left off, how does the ceasefire negotiations sort of interplay [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=498.0s)]
*  with this strike and the fact that we now know today that Secretary Blinken will be [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  returning to the region to visit Israel, the West Bank, Qatar and Saudi Arabia? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=507.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, clearly, Secretary Blinken is hitting all of the key players involved in this, particularly [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=513.1s)]
*  when he talks to the Qataris, because the Qataris are the primary avenue to get in and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=519.1800000000001s)]
*  talk to Hamas. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=523.78s)]
*  He can't discuss with Hamas directly. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=524.78s)]
*  So the fact that Secretary Blinken is coming here is showing that at least there's an effort [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=526.9s)]
*  to move forward with these hostage release negotiations. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=531.4s)]
*  But keep in mind, you have to be patient and unfortunately, you have to be pessimistic. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=535.28s)]
*  If you look at the example of Gilad Shalit when he was kidnapped, it took six years and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=539.26s)]
*  a thousand Palestinian prisoners to get him released. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=543.56s)]
*  So now you're talking about over a hundred that we know that are still alive, or at least [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=546.62s)]
*  we have information that are still alive in Hamas captivity. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=551.0799999999999s)]
*  So you can't be optimistic that you're really talking about more than women and children [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=554.84s)]
*  and elderly being released in this round of talks. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=558.8s)]
*  All right, Mike Tobin, thank you. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  I want to get to Rich Edson. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=563.68s)]
*  He's at the White House with the latest there. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=564.68s)]
*  Hi, Rich. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  Hi, Dana. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  We've just gotten a statement from President Biden. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  The first we've heard from him since these retaliatory strikes, he notes that he did [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=569.4799999999999s)]
*  attend the dignified transfer of the three soldiers who were killed in that drone strike [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=573.76s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=578.0999999999999s)]
*  And now the response to this, he says this afternoon at his direction, U.S. military [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=579.0999999999999s)]
*  forces struck targets at facilities in Iraq and Syria that the IRGC, that's the Iran Revolutionary [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=583.26s)]
*  Guard Corps, and affiliated militia used to attack U.S. forces. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=588.78s)]
*  He goes on to say that our response began today and it will continue at a time and place [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=592.9s)]
*  of our choosing. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=597.94s)]
*  That's a line that the White House and the administration have been using now for some [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=598.94s)]
*  time. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=602.14s)]
*  He also says the U.S. does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=603.14s)]
*  world, but let all those who might seek to do us harm know this. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=607.3s)]
*  If you harm an American, we will respond. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=611.62s)]
*  The president, as he mentioned, attended that dignified transfer earlier today. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=615.1400000000001s)]
*  He's back home at his home in Delaware today, where we expect, well, we weren't expected [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=619.0600000000001s)]
*  to hear much more from him today until he released this statement. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=625.4200000000001s)]
*  There has been plenty of criticism of the White House and the time that it has taken [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=628.7800000000001s)]
*  in this response, several days since the drone attack on early Sunday. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=632.5400000000001s)]
*  You had a number of congressional Republicans saying that it should have been a robust response [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=637.0200000000001s)]
*  and one that should have happened shortly thereafter that attack. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=641.7800000000001s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham had said earlier today before the details of this strike came out [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=646.0200000000001s)]
*  that the lapse of time has lessened the impact of deterrence and by not hitting oil infrastructure [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=649.7s)]
*  in Iran or Revolutionary Guard personnel, you will have failed to make the point. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=654.94s)]
*  Iran is one of those subjects, one of the many subjects that Republicans and the White [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=661.0600000000001s)]
*  House have been at odds over since the beginning of the administration. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=665.7800000000001s)]
*  The White House has tried to get the U.S. back into the Iran nuclear deal. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=669.18s)]
*  Those attempts have failed. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=672.9s)]
*  There was the prisoner swap. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=674.5s)]
*  And you remember the $6 billion that the administration was going to unfreeze for Iranian assets. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=675.6999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. said that that fell apart, especially after the Hamas attack on Israel and Iran's [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=681.14s)]
*  support for Hamas. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=687.4599999999999s)]
*  So this continues to be a point of friction and we'll get more updates from Capitol Hill [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=689.56s)]
*  as the details come out. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=693.38s)]
*  Quick question from me and then the judge and Will. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=694.5799999999999s)]
*  Has the White House called a lid for the day? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=697.34s)]
*  The White House called a lid a couple of hours ago, which is why this statement was a surprise [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=699.3000000000001s)]
*  lid, of course, meaning you're not going to hear from the president today. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=702.74s)]
*  And then, of course, we did. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=705.14s)]
*  And so as this continues, we may expect to hear more from administration officials and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=706.58s)]
*  from the White House. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=710.74s)]
*  All right, Judge Jeanine. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=711.74s)]
*  You know, it's very interesting to hear the administration say, quote, if you harm an [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=712.74s)]
*  American, we will respond. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=716.98s)]
*  It appears that they harmed over 100 Americans before the United States responded. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=719.88s)]
*  And the United States is making it clear that it doesn't want a broader war. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=726.06s)]
*  I mean, the Republicans obviously don't agree with the stance of this administration. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=729.6199999999999s)]
*  I mean, does anyone think this is really going to change things based upon this kind of tepid [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=735.06s)]
*  response? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=740.18s)]
*  You know, Judge, you look at the nearly 170 attacks on U.S. positions in Iraq and in Syria [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=741.18s)]
*  and now in Jordan since the middle of October. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=747.6199999999999s)]
*  And there has been plenty of criticism about the several attacks that the U.S. has had [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=750.3399999999999s)]
*  on positions in Iraq and Syria since those attacks began and sort of the timeline that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=754.88s)]
*  it took just for those retaliatory responses. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=759.84s)]
*  And now what's ostensibly the largest response that we've had to date, the administration [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=763.1600000000001s)]
*  has justified its responses in saying that it's trying to maintain deterrence by trying [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=768.32s)]
*  to ensure that this doesn't spread wider. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=773.8000000000001s)]
*  A conflict doesn't spread wider in the Middle East because you've got Israel fighting Hamas [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=776.12s)]
*  and Gaza. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=780.1600000000001s)]
*  You've got Israel and Hezbollah on the Lebanon border going back and forth. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=781.1600000000001s)]
*  You've got the Houthis in Yemen attacking shipping in the Gulf of Aden and in the Red [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=784.4s)]
*  Sea. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=788.1999999999999s)]
*  And now you've got all of these attacks on American positions on the Middle East. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  But the Republicans have argued and those like Senator Lindsey Graham have argued that [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=792.56s)]
*  unless you have something that is really robust and shows that you mean business, you're not [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=795.84s)]
*  showing that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  In fact, you're only inviting more of these attacks. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  Judd's in at the White House. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=804.66s)]
*  And if they pop the lid again, let us know. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=805.66s)]
*  Let you know. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=807.28s)]
*  OK. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=808.28s)]
*  Take it around the table here, Judge. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=809.28s)]
*  You know, what's interesting about all of this is that the United States is in my last [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=810.56s)]
*  question to Rich is the United States is not going to respond. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=814.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not by going into Tehran. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=817.28s)]
*  OK, when Donald Trump was president, he took took out Soleimani, who was the head of the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=819.4399999999999s)]
*  Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=824.6s)]
*  Now if the United States made a decision to go after that island, wherever that island [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=826.9599999999999s)]
*  is, where they have that oil supply, then we would hurt Iran economically and hurt consequently [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=831.68s)]
*  all of the proxies. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=838.48s)]
*  The problem is if we did that, then the price of oil would go up in a presidential year. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=840.04s)]
*  So you know, the administration again is in this schizophrenic like we're going to let [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=846.76s)]
*  Iran sell oil in the open market. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=850.56s)]
*  We're going to let them beat the billions of dollars that they got from our hostage [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=852.4399999999999s)]
*  exchange. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=856.04s)]
*  But we're going to warn them not to touch Americans. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=857.04s)]
*  But only after they touch 100 and then kill three will we respond. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=859.0s)]
*  It's a schizophrenic. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=862.8s)]
*  It's not clear what we're willing to do. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=864.28s)]
*  There's a huge amount of Cape. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=866.52s)]
*  I mean, if they've already done 85 strikes, 85 targets, that's a huge amount of capacity [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=868.36s)]
*  that Iranian back proxies have in order to attack our troops who are there. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=874.2s)]
*  So if there's if there's several more days of this, then that's a lot of capability that [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=880.6s)]
*  we've allowed them to build up. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=885.8000000000001s)]
*  I would make two points and I would be curious. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=888.24s)]
*  Actually, Greg, it's your response to this, but one of the micro and one of the macro [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBZPoqfPRg&t=891.1600000000001s)]
