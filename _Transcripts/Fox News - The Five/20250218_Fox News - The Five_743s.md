# 'The Five' reacts to Democrats blasting DOGE
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck)
*  Look at some of the waste, fraud, and abuse [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=0.0s)]
*  that's being uncovered by Doge and the people at Doge. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=3.2s)]
*  These are young, often young, but super brilliant people, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=7.54s)]
*  incredible computer scientists and other things. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=11.94s)]
*  And they're finding levels of fraud and waste and abuse [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  like I think nobody ever thought possible. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=21.78s)]
*  President Trump praising the super brilliant people at Doge [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=25.18s)]
*  as the cost-cutting crew put Uncle Sam [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=28.36s)]
*  through a financial colonoscopy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=30.86s)]
*  Doge now estimates they've saved taxpayers $55 billion [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=33.46s)]
*  in counting. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=38.26s)]
*  The brains behind the operation, Elon Musk and President Trump [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=40.04s)]
*  chatting with a man named Sean Hannity [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=42.84s)]
*  in an exclusive interview that airs tonight at 9 PM, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=45.18s)]
*  Musk noting how he went from a liberal saint [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=47.78s)]
*  to the Antichrist. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=50.14s)]
*  I used to be adored by the left. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=52.68s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=54.08s)]
*  Less so these days. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=55.32s)]
*  They call it Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=56.38s)]
*  And you don't realize how real this is until it's, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  you can't reason with people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=62.14s)]
*  So I was at a friend's birthday party [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  and just a birthday dinner. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  I have to mention the president's name. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  And it was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=69.12s)]
*  that contained methamphetamine and rabies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=71.86s)]
*  OK? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=74.42s)]
*  And they're like, wah! [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=75.12s)]
*  And I'm like, what is wrong? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=76.7s)]
*  Guys, you can't have a normal conversation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=78.1s)]
*  And it's like they become completely irrational. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  Proving Elon's point about methamphetamines and rabies, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=85.97999999999999s)]
*  Democrats are still going after Doge [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  like a bunch of frothing animals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=90.52s)]
*  Doge, I call it the Department of Government Inefficiencies, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=94.41999999999999s)]
*  is causing a reign of terror, chaos [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  across the federal government. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=101.44s)]
*  If it's an emperor, Republicans want this President's Day. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=102.89999999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's about time they just say that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=106.83999999999999s)]
*  and drop any and all pretense, because Donald Trump sure has. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=109.13999999999999s)]
*  Doge and Elon Musk and his army of hackers pose a grave risk. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=112.62s)]
*  And there's such a difference, though, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=117.48s)]
*  between perhaps trimming government, reshaping government, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=118.78s)]
*  and dismantling government. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=122.76s)]
*  Nothing is secure right now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  And the government is not being remade to be efficient. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=126.5s)]
*  This is an effort to destroy it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, at least she's not doing math anymore. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=134.4s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=136.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=137.8s)]
*  Look up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=139.0s)]
*  What's her name? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=139.74s)]
*  Mara? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=140.74s)]
*  Gay. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=141.24s)]
*  Mara Gay and math. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=141.8s)]
*  All right, so Harold. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=144.5s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  What's interesting about you is you do not [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=147.10000000000002s)]
*  have the reaction that other Democrats and liberals [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=149.08s)]
*  have towards Trump. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  You're not irrational, and you're not emotional. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=153.68s)]
*  And I'm always curious, is that your own personality, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=155.84s)]
*  or have you applied a filter to your mind that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=158.96s)]
*  makes you navigate this so you don't go crazy? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  I think you could help your peers [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=166.12s)]
*  by explaining how you look at Trump and perhaps Musk. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=168.58s)]
*  Maybe a little bit of both. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=172.62s)]
*  Hope everybody had a great week. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=173.78s)]
*  And it's good to be back. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=174.72s)]
*  I don't care about that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=175.62s)]
*  Good to be back around the table. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=176.66s)]
*  I tried not to be hysterical about things, regardless. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=179.22s)]
*  And there have been times in my life [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=183.6s)]
*  I've had things presented at me when probably should [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=185.1s)]
*  have been more hysterical. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=187.74s)]
*  But I try not to be. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=188.86s)]
*  I think you said it well. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=190.7s)]
*  The $55 billion that Mr. Musk and his group has found so far, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=191.86s)]
*  I put that in the context. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=196.9s)]
*  One, that's probably $50 to $60 billion [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=198.6s)]
*  we should not be spending that we can save. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=201.0s)]
*  You won't find any American, I think, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=203.08s)]
*  Democrat or Republican who is advocating for waste, fraud, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  and abuse. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  So there's that one category of people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=209.12s)]
*  A great friend of mine over dinner [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=210.82s)]
*  was sharing this with me, how he looks at this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=211.84s)]
*  Two, you have to look at whether or not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=214.24s)]
*  we're going to reduce our debt and deficit. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  And it doesn't seem that $55 billion is a great number. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  We have $36 trillion. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=222.08s)]
*  So if you 100 times $55 billion, that's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  $5.5 trillion, and we'd still have $32 trillion in debt. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=226.48s)]
*  I think when you get serious about it, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=230.7s)]
*  you have to look at social security and Medicare and defense [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=232.2s)]
*  spending, which hopefully Mr. Musk will get to. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  But your larger point, Greg, is that I [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=238.14s)]
*  think Democrats, they're still punch drunk. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=242.78s)]
*  And you've said this before from the race. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=246.38s)]
*  The race was just a few months ago. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=248.62s)]
*  President Trump has only been in office for less than six weeks. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=250.14s)]
*  And remember, and you all said it best around the table, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=254.28s)]
*  and some agreed, some disagreed, but you were right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=257.16s)]
*  We never saw Joe Biden. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=259.4s)]
*  So you see this president once or twice a day, maybe more, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=261.04s)]
*  and he is saying things that if you disagree with him, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=265.36s)]
*  it's infuriating because you have [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=267.8s)]
*  to see him twice a day doing it over and over again. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=269.48s)]
*  I watched Jesse, I think it was last night, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=272.1s)]
*  and he talked about the way Republicans are doing it, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=274.48s)]
*  or this president's doing his media, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=277.0s)]
*  and how it's a 21st century media strategy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=279.2s)]
*  So you've got the president in the morning, Joe Rogan. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=281.08s)]
*  You've got a bunch of other influencers and people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=283.34s)]
*  on social media. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=286.2s)]
*  Democrats, if you're serious, think about that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  If you get angry, think about how you can counter that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=289.88s)]
*  with ideas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=292.2s)]
*  But just being hysterical about President Trump or Elon Musk, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  you're only enabling them. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  You're only empowering them, and you're only [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=299.28s)]
*  making people realize that they don't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  like fraud, waste, and abuse. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, you know, well put, Harry. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  Jesse, one of the things that I've been thinking about [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=311.08s)]
*  is that Democrats assume that we are as [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  addicted to praise as they are. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=317.18s)]
*  But as a Republican, we are used to being called Hitler. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=320.14s)]
*  We're used to being called everything. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=323.86s)]
*  So they don't know how to fight people who are immune [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=325.38s)]
*  to their constant smearing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=328.94s)]
*  When I get praised in the press, I don't trust it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=333.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=335.86s)]
*  If the New York Times says something good about me, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=338.41999999999996s)]
*  I figure I must be doing something wrong. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=340.46s)]
*  And if I knew you were watching last night, Harold, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=342.91999999999996s)]
*  I would have had a much better show. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=345.28s)]
*  I was on. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=347.56s)]
*  You were on. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  You were. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  It was a great show. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  So you were watching for the judge, probably. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=350.44s)]
*  I got it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=352.2s)]
*  You guys have a thing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=352.88s)]
*  You know, you're hearing about the Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  And you know, Greg, what you put inside your body with food, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=358.44s)]
*  you kind of, what you put in, what you get out. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=361.32s)]
*  Same thing with your media diet. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=364.24s)]
*  The Democrat media diet is ultra-processed news. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=365.96s)]
*  You get Mad Al, 60 Minutes, New York Times, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=370.7s)]
*  and it makes them sick. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=373.82s)]
*  What they need is a healthy, balanced diet. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=375.5s)]
*  Little Filet-O-Fox, little side of Joe Rogan, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=377.46s)]
*  sprinkle a little Musk on top. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=380.78s)]
*  You'll feel better, and you'll think better. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=383.26s)]
*  And right now, they're not getting the news and information [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  that we're getting. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=389.02s)]
*  If you just think about the government for a second, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi's making more money than Warren Buffett, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=392.26s)]
*  SEC is asleep at the wheel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=395.66s)]
*  The DOD is losing $6 billion in Ukraine. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=397.32000000000005s)]
*  Catholics are harassed. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=400.68s)]
*  Pete Hegseth just got audited. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=402.26000000000005s)]
*  You go down the list. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=404.44s)]
*  It's a mess. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=405.92s)]
*  And if you touch it, they're scared, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=407.66s)]
*  because they think it's their government, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=410.52000000000004s)]
*  and they think it's their money. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=413.08000000000004s)]
*  The way they talk about it, it's like the DNC is being audited. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=414.48s)]
*  And in a way, they're right, because everybody [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  that works in the government's a Democrat. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=420.48s)]
*  So the way they recycle money is they tax it, they take it, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=423.18s)]
*  and they give it to the Democrats. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=426.70000000000005s)]
*  And then the Democrats win elections, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=428.62s)]
*  and then they hire more people to work for the government. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=430.74s)]
*  Have you noticed any Republicans complaining [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=433.86s)]
*  about not getting federal money? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=436.70000000000005s)]
*  Where are all the right-wingers that are getting $40 billion [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=439.06s)]
*  for a study? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=442.62s)]
*  Where are the Second Amendment groups [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  that are getting $13 million for a hub for Second Amendment [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  rights? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=450.90000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=451.66s)]
*  Or what about the countries that are supposedly [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=452.46s)]
*  getting help from USAID? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=454.35999999999996s)]
*  They're not complaining? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=456.28s)]
*  No one's complaining. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=457.23999999999995s)]
*  It's almost like they don't even notice the money's gone, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=458.2s)]
*  because a lot of it's stolen. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=461.0s)]
*  If you were at CNN and you slashed 10% of the CNN headcount, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=462.91999999999996s)]
*  what would happen? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=467.56s)]
*  You turn on to see Wolf Blitzer. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  You wouldn't see Barzenton. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=469.76s)]
*  You'd see handsome Wolf Blitzer doing the news. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=471.32s)]
*  You could cut 10% from any company, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  and it probably wouldn't make it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=477.24s)]
*  Not this one. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=478.67999999999995s)]
*  We are so lean in need. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  This is the leanest company. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=481.08s)]
*  I've ever seen. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=482.32s)]
*  You've overstepped the line. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=483.02s)]
*  I'll take 10% of your salary. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=484.21999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=485.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=486.02s)]
*  Well, Gutfeld staff could lose a few headcounts. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=486.52s)]
*  Other than that, if you're $36 trillion in the hole, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=488.78s)]
*  you can't tax your way out of it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=492.62s)]
*  You've got to do something else. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=494.21999999999997s)]
*  You did say something that is rare for you, brilliant. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=495.58s)]
*  Ultra-processed news, which means [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=498.62s)]
*  you need raw, organic news. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=501.74s)]
*  That's the solution. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=505.1s)]
*  Judge, you know what I loved about Musk? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=506.26s)]
*  He was talking about his former popularity. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=507.98s)]
*  And it's almost like he saw his praise and popularity [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=510.62s)]
*  as expendable. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=515.64s)]
*  I'm going to spend this in order to make the world better. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=517.24s)]
*  He knew this was going to happen. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=520.16s)]
*  Yeah, he did know it was going to happen. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=521.8s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  But my understanding of what he did [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=524.4s)]
*  with the patent for the electric vehicles [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=526.88s)]
*  is that he gave it away. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=529.36s)]
*  Once he discovered it, even though he had a patent, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=531.72s)]
*  he said, here, take it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=534.4s)]
*  You make one, too. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=535.32s)]
*  That's the kind of guy that he is. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=537.24s)]
*  I think it's really hysterical. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=539.46s)]
*  These Democrats, when you talk about Trump to them, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=541.4200000000001s)]
*  it's like they go feral, like a cat. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=543.9s)]
*  It just goes wild. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=547.1800000000001s)]
*  It blows their brains. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=548.38s)]
*  And Musk gets it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=549.9s)]
*  He understands it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=551.1800000000001s)]
*  But I think that what Musk has done [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=552.1s)]
*  is he's doing something that no one else wants to do. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=554.14s)]
*  He's doing something that Congress was never able to do. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=556.98s)]
*  And then you get these MSNBC hosts, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=560.02s)]
*  like Nicole Wallace, who say that President Trump is [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=562.14s)]
*  being an emperor, and the congressional oversight [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=565.1800000000001s)]
*  is the way to go, as if that worked. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=568.26s)]
*  Nobody wants to do this job. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=570.76s)]
*  This is a challenge for Elon Musk. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=572.76s)]
*  This is a guy who's up for the challenge, who's smart enough, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=575.04s)]
*  who knows how to do it, knows how to get it done, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=578.4s)]
*  and is getting it done in Trump time. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=581.16s)]
*  And I just want to say one thing about this. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=584.8s)]
*  Congressman Bindman saying it's a reign of terror [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=586.74s)]
*  for these federal employees. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=589.72s)]
*  How absurd is it that because you have to go to the office, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=591.52s)]
*  they're saying you're being, they're watching you, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=594.84s)]
*  and it's a reign of terror, as if working in the office [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=597.9s)]
*  means you're subject to surveillance? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=601.18s)]
*  I mean, these people think they're entitled to a job. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=603.02s)]
*  They think they have the right to work from home. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  And it is a manufactured narrative. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=607.74s)]
*  And these people are making themselves crazy [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=610.38s)]
*  when right now a federal judge has just ruled [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=612.62s)]
*  that Doge is just fine. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=615.72s)]
*  And this is a judge who doesn't have [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=617.66s)]
*  any favoritism toward Donald Trump. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=619.9399999999999s)]
*  She said, I'm not going to give them [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=622.24s)]
*  a temporary restraining order, the 14 attorney generals. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=623.36s)]
*  You haven't showed me imminent damage, imminent harm. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  Dana, it is interesting. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=631.56s)]
*  It's like, I think that Musk is gravitating [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=632.88s)]
*  towards the kind of the Republican world [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=636.56s)]
*  because it's an acceptance of unpopularity. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=638.2199999999999s)]
*  You don't get lavish praise for doing, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=641.4s)]
*  making adult decisions. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=644.24s)]
*  You have to like, in your in government, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=646.56s)]
*  you take other people's money and you give it to people [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=648.86s)]
*  and you get praise. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=651.8s)]
*  A conservative, no matter who you are, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=653.24s)]

*  So then you have to kind of crawl your way up [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=658.4200000000001s)]
*  to maybe get to where Jesse can get praised [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=660.62s)]
*  in the New York Times. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=662.4200000000001s)]
*  And they smack you back down into your hole. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=663.26s)]
*  The last four years, the Democrats were able to use [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=666.22s)]
*  like EPA and Department of Education and USAID [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=669.1s)]
*  to put money in that helped groups that supported them. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=673.5s)]
*  And that's not a conspiracy theory. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=677.22s)]
*  That was reported in the AP [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=679.24s)]
*  as part of the ultra process news diet. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=680.58s)]

*  to somebody on the other side, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=687.0s)]
*  it is shocking the things that they don't know. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=689.16s)]
*  Now, maybe they think the same thing is true about us, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=691.76s)]
*  but I feel like I read a lot of them. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=694.16s)]
*  We have to read both. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=695.5999999999999s)]
*  They don't. You have to. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=696.76s)]
*  And there's no shortcut. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=698.0s)]
*  You have to read it all. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you notice. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=700.92s)]
*  If you're following Bill Maher's trajectory, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=702.28s)]

*  And he's like, oh, I didn't know that. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=708.92s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=710.3599999999999s)]
*  And that it's interesting to see that gradual enlightenment. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=711.3399999999999s)]
*  Isn't that great? Wonderful. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=716.14s)]
*  I thought that was a great segment, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=718.02s)]
*  much like my new clipboard. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=719.66s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=721.14s)]
*  Thanks, Cole. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KeSV9m_sck&t=722.6999999999999s)]
