# 'The Five' on Comey's 'bizarre threat' to Trump
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo)
*  Incredible. All right, so let's go first to the veracity of this issue, Jesse, of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=0.0s)]
*  potential. I don't know about you, but I have never once, and I've walked down the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  beach a lot, I have never in my life come upon a political statement on the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=11.36s)]
*  beach made out of sea life. So I find this to be a bit too coincidental. Put [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=18.04s)]
*  up this one. There's another one on his Instagram feed as well. This one, another [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=23.52s)]
*  blue painted shell that he found in October of 2024 when he was walking [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=28.12s)]
*  down the beach. Vote Harris. And he posted this as well. And he said, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=32.44s)]
*  Ariel understands the assignment. So I asked you, do you think that these are being constructed by James [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=36.56s)]
*  Comey with his little shells and then he takes the picture or not? Dust the shells for [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=45.0s)]
*  Prince Martha. I don't know if he made it or not. He obviously was trying to put a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=49.14s)]
*  hit out on Trump, got caught, deleted it, and he's got a book out. Oh, what a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=53.84s)]
*  coincidence. Any cop, any prosecutor knows the code for homicide. 8-6 isn't just a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=57.96s)]
*  mafia slang, it's a military slang. 8-6, T-O, and a rotary phone. He was a Marine. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=67.08s)]
*  He obviously knew what he was doing here. And he's not just any old FBI director, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=75.2s)]
*  Martha. He tried to frame this guy for treason. Remember, he spied on his [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=79.72s)]
*  campaign. He got caught, got fired, leaked, and then ran away from Durham so he [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=84.2s)]
*  wouldn't have to answer any questions. He has called Trump a dangerous threat to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=89.84s)]
*  the country who should be punished for the things he says. Now, I don't know if [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=94.76s)]
*  this guy wants attention for the book. And by the way, the book is about right [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=99.56s)]
*  wing extremists who launch a terror attack in Manhattan. Or if he wants to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=103.04s)]
*  be arrested because his life sucks. He's lost all his respect. No one likes him. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=107.4s)]
*  And he's probably dying and goading the administration to put him in handcuffs [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=113.42s)]
*  because that's all he really has anymore going for him. This man has set the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=121.58s)]
*  Democrats back again. Everybody with common sense knows what this guy meant, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=126.9s)]
*  just like we knew it was MS-13 on the knuckles, Jessica. Everybody knows 86-47. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=132.18s)]
*  So the whole country sees this and then they lie about it. And then this is the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=137.7s)]
*  guy that weaponized the entire Justice Department against President Trump. And [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  it just reminds everybody the lengths the Democrats will go to lie. Meanwhile, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=148.74s)]
*  Trump, he's trying to make peace. And this guy's calling for his head. I hope [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=153.1s)]
*  the Secret Service knocks on his door at his little beach house and pays him a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=158.42s)]
*  visit because this can't stand. After two attempts on Trump's life, he can't take [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=162.34s)]
*  this lightly. I hope they figure out if his hands were just all over those [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=166.42s)]
*  shelves painting them. Is there sand in your fingernails, Comey? Let me see your [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  fingernails. Seriously, Jessica Tarlov. I mean, this is strange. This is strange [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=175.61999999999998s)]
*  behavior. It's like weirdly childish, the stuff he posts. When you go back and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=179.22s)]
*  look at the way he posts things. I mean, he's out of a job. He can live any way [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=182.82s)]
*  he wants. He's writing this book. He's been writing novels. But what do you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  think about the fact that he was willing to post this thing, which is such an [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=190.22s)]
*  and then pretend like he doesn't know what it means? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=194.42s)]
*  It was really stupid, but it is also First Amendment protected speech and 86 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=198.26s)]
*  saying I'm not as familiar with the mafia lingo, but I do know what happens [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=203.89999999999998s)]
*  in restaurants when they say like 86 the meatloaf. And that means they're out of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=207.38s)]
*  meatloaf. I also know that if you go on Amazon, you can find tons of swag that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=211.62s)]
*  says 86 46, which I guess in Jesse's terms was about killed Joe Biden. I know [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=216.78s)]
*  on Donald Trump's true social feed that I saw that video with Joe Biden hogtied [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=222.06s)]
*  in the back of a truck, which I'm pretty sure means, you know, don't treat him [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=227.54s)]
*  with respect that the you know, the office, but it wasn't the FBI director [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=231.06s)]
*  who was doing that stuff. Well, it was actually the former president of the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=235.18s)]
*  United States and a candidate to be president of the United States again, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=238.22s)]
*  amplifying something like that. Matt Gates has tweeted about 86 saying right [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=240.82s)]
*  wing activists have done 86 46. And now they're totally outraged. But I'll cycle [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=244.54s)]
*  back really stupid. It's not up there. And you know, I have 11 days before the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=251.34s)]
*  election coming out and saying that they're reopening the investigation into [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=256.02000000000004s)]
*  Hillary Clinton to be the most stupid and that that did actually cost her the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=259.58s)]
*  election in the end in 2016. But James Comey has bothered me once again. It is [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=263.42s)]
*  leading every cycle. I wanted to come in and talk about the big, beautiful bill [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=270.18s)]
*  failing in the House Budget Committee. And now I have to talk about Comey. So [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=274.02s)]
*  mission accomplished that way. But it was just dumb. Let's play this from [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=276.98s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard with Jesse last night. Watch. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=282.14s)]
*  You believe Comey should be in jail? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=287.14s)]
*  I do. Any other person with the position of influence that he has, people who [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=289.62s)]
*  take very seriously what a guy of his stature, his experience and what the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=296.98s)]
*  propaganda media has built him up to be. I'm very concerned for the president's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=302.06s)]
*  life. We've already seen assassination attempts. I'm very concerned for his [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=307.09999999999997s)]
*  life. And James Comey, in my view, should be held accountable and put behind bars [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=310.86s)]
*  for this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=315.9s)]
*  So Greg, what do you think should happen? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I think you don't throw him in jail. You just kind of look, look, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=318.74s)]
*  he went to the beach because he's all washed up. I like the thing I like is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=323.21999999999997s)]
*  how the dying media is portraying this story as conservatives pounce on this. Oh [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  my God, they're making it out into something. It really isn't. You guys [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  invented the pounce. You know, Elon Musk makes a salute. You spent a week on [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=338.98s)]
*  that talking about how that was Hitlerian and how all Trump supporters [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=343.58000000000004s)]
*  were Nazis. The only exercise the media gets is by pouncing. So we're going to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=347.86s)]
*  pounce a little. You guys hit the showers. The people who pounce every day [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=353.06s)]
*  on every little thing Trump has said and created hoaxes off nothing. Do not [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=358.9s)]
*  lecture us on blowing things out of proportion. There's so many people whose [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=364.26s)]
*  identity is tied forever to Trump, but it's their choice. It's not like Trump [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=369.34s)]
*  spends his life thinking about this chuckle nut. This is this guy has Trump [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=374.14s)]
*  on the brain all the time. Trump has created a legion of people whose brains [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  are somehow broken. And I said this, I think yesterday, if the filter that you [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=382.82s)]
*  have to see life constantly has you waking up with disappointment and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=386.7s)]
*  bitterness, you should probably change your filter. You know, Jesse, someone [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=390.58s)]
*  once said, holding on to a grudge is like drinking poison, hoping it kills the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=395.3s)]
*  other person. I think it was either Nelson Mandela or Ryan Seacrest. But you [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=401.14s)]
*  see this among never Trumpers. The first thing they do every morning is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=406.78s)]
*  they drink the poison, you know, and I don't, by the way, I don't, I don't be [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=412.34s)]
*  grudge Democrats. I don't think Jessica's like this. Sports is politics is a team [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=417.14s)]
*  sport. So you're a guy lost. You don't like the guy who won. I see these grudges [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=423.97999999999996s)]
*  more on people on the right, never Trumpers who have who have so much [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=429.02s)]
*  negative emotion that it impacts the way they look at everything and their own [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=433.62s)]
*  wellbeing. They have to learn from like this guy is definitely stuck with a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=438.3s)]
*  broken Trump brain. And when you're on the beach making little stones that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=442.86s)]
*  there's you got a problem. You look at like Bill Maher, when Bill Maher went to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=447.7s)]
*  visit Trump, what did you there's one thing you knew, both of them felt a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=452.66s)]
*  little emotionally lighter afterwards. There's something about doing that that [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=457.22s)]
*  makes you feel better. You got to let go of these these crazy. I mean, I don't [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=462.74s)]
*  care. He can do whatever he wants. He can he can write my name in stones. I don't [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=466.46s)]
*  give a damn. But he's just ruining his own mind in his own life. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=470.62s)]
*  Emily, there were two assassination attempts against the president and you [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  know, stuff on social media does fire up weirdos and and whack jobs. And it's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=478.78s)]
*  possible that this kind of thing from Comey could, you know, make someone want [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=484.46s)]
*  to do something terrible because we've seen it. We've seen it happen twice [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=488.85999999999996s)]
*  already. Of course, of course. He's in a position of persuasion. He's in a [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=491.46s)]
*  position of authority. He was ready carries that title forever. I don't even [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=495.7s)]
*  like a post. I may crack up. I do not like a post if I think it would reflect [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=499.34s)]
*  poorly on the brand I represent at all times. It's so shocking to me. It's [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=503.78s)]
*  obvious that he's an odd duck. And I feel like that's where social media sort [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=507.74s)]
*  of like sucks is when all it gives everyone the voices that they're just [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=511.02s)]
*  weird. And you're like, oh, like the selfies he takes of himself. It's sort [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=514.5s)]
*  of it just underscores that this wasn't, frankly, a normal person we've been [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=517.86s)]
*  dealing with, regardless of his high stature position. But look, here's the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=521.26s)]
*  that's a great one. I literally have like the same picture of me and like my [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=524.7s)]
*  cheerleading of it. I talked to my friend. He's a longtime presidential [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=528.06s)]
*  Secret Service agent, right? He was Hinkley's case officer, Jeff James. He [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=532.54s)]
*  talks to me about that. They investigate every threat. So the concept that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=535.98s)]
*  there's somehow a question of whether this is should be investigated. That's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=539.86s)]
*  not the question. The question is whether it's actionable. And he talked [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=543.7s)]
*  to me about so many threats that, you know, they show up at some guy's house [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=546.78s)]
*  in central Pennsylvania. He doesn't even have two nickels to rub together. He's [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=549.34s)]
*  a rusty shotgun he shoots squirrels with for dinner. But they had to investigate [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=552.8s)]
*  it. And upon arriving realized, all right, his threats are full of crap, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=557.04s)]
*  right? An inmate at a state prison that wanted to be transferred to federal [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=560.24s)]
*  prison. That's why he was threatening the president. But the Secret Service [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=563.4799999999999s)]
*  shows up. So Jeff Comey better wait for a knock at the door because I know my [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  tax dollars are going to be spent wisely. And at the end of the day, they'll [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=569.5999999999999s)]
*  just realize, oh, sorry, this is just some idiot's house and it's not [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=572.8s)]
*  actionable. But final point real quick. President Trump, the amount that he has [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=576.16s)]
*  been indicted emotionally and specifically for his comments to incite [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=580.56s)]
*  others. So his comment, we will never give up that that was considered [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  incitement. Well, then I think this is pretty dang close. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfmMO1VGuo&t=590.2399999999999s)]
