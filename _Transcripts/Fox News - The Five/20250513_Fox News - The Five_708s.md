# 'The Five' on bombshell Biden book: 'The media is dead'
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Dana Perino along with Katie Pavlich, Marie Harf, Jesse Waters and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=0.0s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=4.8s)]
*  It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=5.8s)]
*  The Democrats who really want Joe Biden to go away, well they might want to buckle up [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=14.76s)]
*  because we're getting another brutal bombshell about the coverup of former President Biden's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  mental decline. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=24.12s)]
*  Privately advisors debated whether a wheelchair would be required to get him through a second [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=25.56s)]
*  term. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=30.16s)]
*  The president's doctor privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=31.16s)]
*  be necessary and quipped that Biden's staff members were trying to kill him while he was [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=35.4s)]
*  trying to keep him alive. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=40.62s)]
*  These revelations shouldn't come as a shock if you were watching The Five during the Biden [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=42.56s)]
*  presidency and now one of the book's co-authors is using the L word to describe the White [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=47.0s)]
*  House. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=52.0s)]
*  Alex Thompson and I were on the case as were lots of other reporters trying to figure out [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=53.56s)]
*  what was going on behind the scenes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=58.6s)]
*  But the bottom line is the White House was lying, not only to the press, not only to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=61.56s)]
*  the public, but they were lying to members of their own cabinet. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=65.68s)]
*  There are critics, however, that are pointing this out. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=68.92s)]
*  The Tapper's record on the subject isn't exactly squeaky clean. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=71.0s)]
*  How do you think it makes little kids with stutters feel when they see you make a comment [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=75.68s)]
*  like that? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=79.64s)]
*  It's very clearly a cognitive decline. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=80.64s)]
*  That's what I'm referring to. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=82.72s)]
*  It makes me uncomfortable to watch them on stage. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=84.08s)]
*  It's so amazing to me that the Washington Post just put out a piece examining how President [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=87.48s)]
*  Biden embraces his stutter talking about it while Trump mocks it, exaggerates it, belittles [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  He's sharp physically. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean mentally. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  I think the question is physically, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  He's 81 and his memory, you know, it doesn't seem great. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=103.76s)]
*  It's not horrible. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=107.16s)]
*  But that's not all, folks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden apparently did not recognize George Clooney at their fundraiser and had to be [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=110.64s)]
*  told who he was by an aide. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=115.12s)]
*  Now that is an outrage, isn't it? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=116.68s)]
*  Which apparently left the superstar shaken to his core. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=118.6s)]
*  And that was the part that I thought was pretty funny. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=121.68s)]
*  Like imagine you're George Clooney, Jesse, and somebody doesn't recognize you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=123.68s)]
*  Like when that happens to you, is it really upsetting? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=127.84s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=130.44s)]
*  How dare they? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=131.44s)]
*  And then George Clooney said, all right, I'm going to write the op-ed that does him in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=132.44s)]
*  Did him in. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=135.8s)]
*  Barack, remember, told him to write the op-ed. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=136.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=138.44s)]
*  Clooney doesn't do anything himself. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=139.44s)]
*  He's the black actor, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=141.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=144.24s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=145.24s)]
*  So wheelchairs, there's nothing wrong with wheelchairs. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=146.24s)]
*  I use them all the time at the airport. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=147.72s)]
*  You don't even have to have a doctor's note. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=150.48s)]
*  You could just say you're late and they'll wheel you around to give him 20 bucks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=151.96s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=156.3s)]
*  We were just talking about what we would have called Joe if he was in a wheelchair, asleep [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=157.3s)]
*  at the wheel. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=160.92s)]
*  You would have been. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=161.92s)]
*  You were talking about it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=162.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=163.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was just me. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=164.92s)]
*  So I want to just talk to the people that don't watch us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=167.68s)]
*  How would I do that if they're watching us? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=171.58s)]
*  But let me put it differently. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=173.16s)]
*  Do you like to time travel? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you like to see the future? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=176.96s)]
*  Well, I have something in store for you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=178.8s)]
*  You can just watch Fox and you don't have to buy books from CNN. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=181.84s)]
*  Okay? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=185.96s)]
*  You'll know the future by watching us. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=186.96s)]
*  That's how this goes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=189.56s)]
*  Now Jake, this is what the media is doing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  I wasn't a part of the cover-up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=195.02s)]
*  Ron Klain's like, no, it was Dr. Jill. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=196.76s)]
*  Tapper's like, oh no, we were trying real hard. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=198.6s)]
*  It's everybody's pointing their finger. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=201.84s)]
*  He's getting paid to write a book about what we said four years ago. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=204.68s)]
*  And we had Rand Paul on last night. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=209.4s)]
*  And Rand Paul was against tariffs. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=212.28s)]
*  He was against the Muslim plane and the drug prices. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=214.04s)]
*  And that's fine because at this company, you can say whatever you want if it's your opinion. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=217.48s)]
*  We don't have to tow the line here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=221.66s)]
*  Now if you go back four years and someone had gone on CNN and said, Biden's brain dead, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  the lab leak, the lab top, they would have cut your mic and you would have been banished [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  from CNN. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Now being banished from CNN is a badge of honor, but still you can hear the truth here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  If Joe Biden had done decently at that debate, cover-up still would have happened. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=240.28s)]
*  There would have been no book. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=245.46s)]
*  There would have been no book advance. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=246.46s)]
*  We would not be hearing about this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=248.52s)]
*  They would just slap him in a wheelchair on November 6th and they would have said, see, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=249.8s)]
*  he's just like FDR. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=253.84s)]
*  They're both in wheelchairs and they both defeated Nazis. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=255.28s)]
*  What's more dangerous? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump being president or a secretive cabal of unelected officials controlling the president [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  using auto pen and overruling him and then lying to the public about it? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  What's more unconstitutional? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=269.52s)]
*  What's more corrupt? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  In a way, Trump saved democracy. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=272.12s)]
*  That's brilliant. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  You can say whatever you want here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=278.76s)]
*  That doesn't make it right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=280.32s)]
*  One thing that really bothers me, Greg, is that still there are so many anonymous sources, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=281.32s)]
*  but they're not anonymous because they're worried that Democrats will be mad at them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=285.55999999999995s)]
*  They're worried that they're going to be caught as liars. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=290.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=293.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=294.0s)]
*  If that matters at this point. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=295.0s)]
*  I love that they thought that he needed a wheelchair if he won. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=296.0s)]
*  Apparently he wouldn't need one if he didn't win. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=300.32s)]
*  No, they just didn't care. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=304.2s)]
*  They didn't care about his health at all. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=307.08s)]
*  They just worried about the optics that he would need a wheelchair if he won. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=309.32s)]
*  I am tired of these books. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=314.12s)]
*  They should have watched The Five. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  They should have watched Fox. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  We were doing the reporting in real time. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=317.56s)]
*  Not right now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=319.68s)]
*  The books are now just an admission of guilt. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  The Dems can never bring up the 25th Amendment ever again. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  Even if Trump's brain is in a vat in the Oval Office running the country, we're going to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=327.84s)]
*  say, oh no, no, no, he's sharp as a tack. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=332.91999999999996s)]
*  There's this other thing about the media's excuse, which is killing me. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=336.96s)]
*  The White House was lying to us. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=341.84s)]
*  Well duh. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=344.64s)]
*  That's to be expected. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=346.24s)]
*  It's called spin. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=347.85999999999996s)]
*  Your job is to assume that they're not telling you the truth. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=349.62s)]
*  You're a journalist. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  You just don't go, oh, they say Joe's fine. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  Nothing to see here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you should offer a little bit more resistance than Facebook asking if you're [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  18. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=363.0s)]
*  That's how bad it is. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=365.0s)]
*  So it's not about Joe's condition at all. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=366.72s)]
*  Nobody cares at this point. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=369.56s)]
*  It's the media's condition. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=371.1s)]
*  There are two diagnoses. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=372.92s)]
*  One, you're the dumbest, most incompetent generation of journalists ever on the planet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=373.92s)]
*  Or two, you deliberately covered up Joe's dramatic decline because you're biased. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=379.74s)]
*  That is all you have. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=384.32s)]
*  There's no in between. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=385.92s)]
*  I would say if I were them, I would come clean and go, you know what, we knew Biden was a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=387.64s)]
*  mess. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=392.04s)]
*  It was obvious. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=393.04s)]
*  As Democrats, we prefer to him over this existential threat known as Donald Trump. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=394.04s)]
*  And they had called him Hitler, which meant anytime they criticized Biden, they would [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=399.72s)]
*  get grief for helping Hitler. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=405.44s)]
*  So they couldn't actually be honest or else that would be seen as somehow doing something [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=408.0s)]
*  horrible. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  But the media, Biden's still alive. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=413.92s)]
*  The media is dead. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=417.12s)]
*  Put a tag on their toe. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=419.24s)]
*  Call Quincy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=420.76s)]
*  Shove the body in a fridge because the corpse, it's starting to reek. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=421.92s)]
*  And who's going to identify the body? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=426.76s)]
*  Well, I have a suggestion. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=428.68s)]
*  Chuck Schumer was asked about this and we have a little sound. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=429.92s)]
*  Watch here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=434.24s)]
*  You said in June of last year, in my meetings with President Biden, I found to be command [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=435.24s)]
*  and impressive and building influence to make progress on key priorities. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=441.24s)]
*  But in that same month, Biden apparently did not even recognize George Clooney in a fundraiser. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=445.24s)]
*  Are you being strained with the American public? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=451.24s)]
*  Look, we're just looking forward. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=453.08s)]
*  Marie, is that going to cut it for Democrats? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=455.2s)]
*  I know you want Democrats to win and be successful in the future. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=458.6s)]
*  Will that help? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=461.64s)]
*  No. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=462.64s)]
*  And I think because I want Democrats to win and because I think Donald Trump is an existential [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=463.64s)]
*  threat to many of the things we care about. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=468.04s)]
*  And the fact that the people in the White House who agree with me on that in the Biden [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=472.08s)]
*  White House, they believed this about Trump winning again. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=476.08s)]
*  They knew how problematic that would be for so many of the things they have fought for. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=479.08s)]
*  And yet in 2017 and 18, 19, 20, they saw that, you know, they got him elected and then they [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=483.88s)]
*  saw the decline continue. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  And after the midterms, I've talked to lots of my friends who've worked in that White [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=493.08s)]
*  House. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=496.52s)]
*  After the midterms, there was never a conversation about whether he should run again because [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=497.52s)]
*  Democrats overperformed, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=500.91999999999996s)]
*  We did better than people thought we would. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=502.76s)]
*  And nobody had the courage in that White House to stand up to him and Joe Biden and say, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=505.72s)]
*  if you run again, we will lose. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=511.68s)]
*  And the fact that got to the June of the election year and that disastrous debate performance [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=515.72s)]
*  for him to be forced out. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=521.6s)]
*  I mean, there we had no chance at that point, right? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=523.32s)]
*  You can't run a campaign with no primary being anointed in 100 days. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=526.48s)]
*  And I am the fact that George Clooney had more courage than every elected Democrat. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=532.68s)]
*  They made fun of Dean Phillips, right? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=538.76s)]
*  To say the things. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  They didn't recognize him. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  The ultimate insult in Hollywood. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=543.0799999999999s)]
*  It sounds like he didn't recognize a lot of people that worked for him. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  The fact that he was the only one to say, I need to write a New York Times op-ed. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=549.4s)]
*  And all these people, now they're coming out, most of them anonymously, which I agree is [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=553.4s)]
*  I don't like. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=557.52s)]
*  David, plus, you know, God bless him. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=558.52s)]
*  At least he's willing to be on the record. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=559.88s)]
*  You know, this is one of those points where George Clooney or a celebrity could actually [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=560.88s)]
*  say, do you know who I am? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=564.96s)]
*  You don't even know who I am. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=566.72s)]
*  There's so much anger. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=569.72s)]
*  I like Joe Biden a lot. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=571.36s)]
*  I don't like that his legacy will always be this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=572.68s)]
*  It will always be this. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=575.2s)]
*  And his team did that to him. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=576.2s)]
*  Kate T. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=577.92s)]
*  Kate T. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=578.92s)]
*  You're not my assistant, Kate. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=579.92s)]
*  You're Katie. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=582.92s)]
*  There are 200 Democratic insiders quoted in here. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=583.92s)]
*  A lot of them are anonymous. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=586.44s)]
*  Even their current spokespeople, they want to remain anonymous. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  They don't want anything to do with this. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  OK, they are still so afraid of just speaking the truth about what happened, that they're [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=594.36s)]
*  not willing to come out on the record on this when everybody could see what was going on. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=599.36s)]
*  Nobody was courageous. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  George Clooney wasn't courageous. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=606.88s)]
*  Barack Obama wasn't courageous. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=608.52s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi wasn't courageous. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  Democrats had a choice. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=612.88s)]
*  They could have had a primary. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=613.88s)]
*  Instead of having a primary, they were running around suing RFK Jr. and Dean Phillips trying [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=614.92s)]
*  to keep them off of ballots. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  There was a choice here. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=622.12s)]
*  Can I add one thing? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=623.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=624.12s)]
*  They also didn't want a primary because Biden and his team did not believe that Kamala Harris [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=625.12s)]
*  would win. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=627.96s)]
*  Well, after he dropped out. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=628.96s)]
*  So they lost the opportunity on two primaries, on the front end and on the back end. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=631.28s)]
*  They lost two, so much for democracy. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=635.92s)]
*  They were all fine with this because they wanted Joe Biden to stay in office because [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=638.28s)]
*  he was an empty vessel. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=642.12s)]
*  They were allowed to push through whatever they wanted. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=643.68s)]
*  We still have no answers about who was actually making these decisions. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=645.7199999999999s)]
*  We don't even have a lot of information still on the day that he dropped out and posted [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=648.68s)]
*  his resignation letter for the campaign on Twitter. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't have very much information about that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=654.92s)]
*  So this is about a lack of trust. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=657.3599999999999s)]
*  And for Jake Tapper to come out now and say, oh, well, the White House was lying. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, so were you. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=663.2399999999999s)]
*  And CNN covered a presidential election. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=664.8399999999999s)]
*  And you don't think that it was pertinent to the American people and important for them [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=667.3599999999999s)]
*  to know about all of these details. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=670.92s)]
*  And now, all of a sudden, that these anonymous sources and people are willing to talk about [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  it, they want to pat on the back for saying what was obvious. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=676.24s)]
*  We have more details now, but this was happening. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  And for now, for them to say the doctor was recommending there may need to be a wheelchair [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=682.12s)]
*  for the second term, let's not forget they never made the White House doctor available [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=686.68s)]
*  for questioning, not a single time. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=690.88s)]
*  Do you think there will be a congressional hearing? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=694.56s)]
*  I think there will be. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=695.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=696.56s)]
*  Well, we will have much more on this. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=697.56s)]
*  It's not going to end. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jfuOljuGsM&t=698.7199999999999s)]
