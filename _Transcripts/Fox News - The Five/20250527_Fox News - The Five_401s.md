# ‘The Five’: Dems are spending money for this?
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s)
*  Can $20 million by the Democrats some street cred with the cool kids? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, they certainly hope so. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  The party is spending big to win back those Joe Rogan-loving men who flocked to President [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=11.1s)]
*  Apparently, Tim Walz doing manly things like fixing cars and pheasant hunting didn't quite [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=12.1s)]
*  resonate. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  And according to the New York Times, Democrats are dropping $20 million on a new project. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  It's called code-named SAM, short for Speaking With American Men, a strategic plan. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=21.96s)]
*  And it promises investment to study the syntax, language, and content that gains attention [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=28.48s)]
*  and virality in these spaces. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=34.42s)]
*  I do not know why they spent $20 million on it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=37.24s)]
*  It recommends buying advertisements in video games, amongst other things. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=39.76s)]
*  But can you actually buy authenticity? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=43.4s)]
*  This Democratic strategist apparently does think it's possible. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=45.64s)]
*  If you dig in on what Democrats are researching right now, you're going to find a lot of silly [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=49.04s)]
*  stuff. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=53.28s)]
*  You're going to find people asking a lot of questions, people asking about syntax, and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=54.28s)]
*  do I drop the G from this word and this and that? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=57.88s)]
*  And there's going to be a lot of that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=61.0s)]
*  So let me just warn everybody, that process is going to be very obnoxious. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=62.6s)]
*  We're really talking about young men, right? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=66.72s)]
*  Young men who Democrats have not figured out a consistent pitch for how to get in front [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=69.2s)]
*  of. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=73.08s)]
*  And I think it starts with authenticity. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=74.08s)]
*  Stop creating purity tests for people because they don't agree with you eight or nine, ten [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=76.2s)]
*  times. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=81.2s)]
*  But getting young guns back on Team Democrat is just one piece of the rebrand puzzle. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=82.2s)]
*  Barack Obama's former Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, is calling his party's brand weak [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=86.28s)]
*  and woke, as speculation mounts that he'll run for president in 2028. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=90.68s)]
*  And Rahm's not the only one with ideas on how Democrats can win again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=95.28s)]
*  The Democrats have forgot that maybe we should just talk to people like people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  We don't need to do studies on it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=103.68s)]
*  We don't need to meet at hotels. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  How about we just go to community meetings? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=106.48s)]
*  Is not the question of what the party's image is, but is what does the party stand for? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=108.32s)]
*  If the party's positions on issues that are weak and woke, it will seem weak and woke. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=113.32s)]
*  I don't think nationally the Democratic brand helps very much anyway. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=121.32s)]
*  I mean, anywhere. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=125.0s)]
*  If it did, we wouldn't have lost to Donald Trump twice. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, Harold, it's great to be back around the table. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=129.68s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=133.16s)]
*  I'm glad you're back. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=134.6s)]
*  Do Democrats love to just waste money? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=135.6s)]
*  I hope everybody had a good weekend. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=138.12s)]
*  I don't think Democrats are wasting money on this effort if the effort is organized [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=141.12s)]
*  and designed right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=147.76s)]
*  I think if the effort is trying to come up with new words or words that you think will [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=148.76s)]
*  appeal to people, then it will be a waste of money. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=153.28s)]
*  If the exercise is to try to figure out how you develop and implement an affordability [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=157.72s)]
*  agenda for every working American, be they middle class Americans, wealthy Americans, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=163.68s)]
*  trying to enter and graduate into the middle class. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=170.84s)]
*  If the effort is to find ways in which to show that not investing in critical research, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=173.88s)]
*  not investing in things that so many of our universities from the University of Florida [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  to Harvard University to the University of Michigan are engaged in, that are making the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=183.6s)]
*  world a safer place, America's safer place and healthier place. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=188.06s)]
*  If the focus is there, then you begin to try to populate words around that agenda that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=192.0s)]
*  will resonate and connect with voters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=196.56s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=199.68s)]
*  But if you're only looking to try to find words that may make you seem more masculine [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=200.68s)]
*  or may make you seem more manly, I'm using the terminology they're using, I think not [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=206.94000000000003s)]
*  only will you not persuade voters, you'll just continue to confuse yourself. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=211.56s)]
*  So affordability, what's going to make America stronger and smarter over the next 25, 50 years [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=215.66000000000003s)]
*  and what's going to make our national security better? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=222.34s)]
*  We figure that out first, then you can develop the words and the language that can help you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=224.78s)]
*  convey that, but not in reverse order. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=229.3s)]
*  Then it would be a waste of money. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=231.86s)]
*  I think, Jesy, what he's saying and your comment is basically you have to know what you stand [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=233.22s)]
*  for before you decide what you're going to say about it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=237.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=240.02s)]
*  It's like hiring Don Draper for an ad campaign for a product that doesn't even exist. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=241.02s)]
*  Usually the commercial happens after you have a new product. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=245.62s)]
*  Harold is the only real man left in the Democrat Party. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=250.06s)]
*  Democrats should save 20 mil and watch The Five for free. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  Democrat men are afraid of offending minorities and women and the woke snobs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=259.41999999999996s)]
*  And the voters are like dogs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=267.62s)]
*  We smell fear and it's just all over the Democrat process. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=269.34s)]
*  Saying the right thing doesn't matter. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  It's about doing the right thing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=278.06s)]
*  Democrats need to figure out what the right thing is and then do it instead of trying [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  to trick men into believing they're doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=284.3s)]
*  Remember when they couldn't define what a woman was? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=289.86s)]
*  Now they're trying to define what a man is. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=293.18s)]
*  It's like an anthropologist studying the uncontacted tribes of the Amazon jungle. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=296.14s)]
*  Except Democrats aren't even flying to Brazil. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=303.14s)]
*  They're paying other people to listen to Rogan. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=306.06s)]
*  There's the NBA playoffs going on. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=310.1s)]
*  We just finished with football. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=312.3s)]
*  They've been talking about going to sports. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=313.74s)]
*  I haven't seen them in a single game. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  They're not even putting in the work that needs to be done. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=318.18s)]
*  Males are half the voting population. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=321.82s)]
*  Whites are like two thirds of the country. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=325.58s)]
*  These are large blocks of voters that they have no idea how to deal with. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  Bottom line, men don't like to be controlled. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=335.14s)]
*  We don't like being told what we can't say, what vaccines we have to be putting on our [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=337.66s)]
*  body, what cars to drive, what food to eat. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=342.58s)]
*  If they ever find a liberal Rogan, they're going to control him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=345.26s)]
*  They're going to tell him what topics not to do, what guests not to have. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=349.38s)]
*  It's going to be the same thing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=352.85999999999996s)]
*  They're admitting by this stupid study for 20 mil that the legacy media has no real men [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=354.82s)]
*  in it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=359.29999999999995s)]
*  They've run them all out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=360.82s)]
*  They've fired them. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=361.82s)]
*  You can't be a real man and go on the Today Show. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=362.82s)]
*  All the rest of them are henpecked or women on these legacy media platforms. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  That's what they should try to figure out because the infrastructure is already there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=371.88s)]
*  So, Greg, this is my favorite genre of all time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=375.64s)]
*  This is just the same story over and over again. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=379.28s)]
*  Remember that Kamala Harris rebrand story. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=381.56s)]
*  Every 20 days, they were like, oh, we have a new, we're going to roll her out again. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=384.04s)]
*  We're going to have some sort of a new thing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=387.8s)]
*  They'll spend 20 million dollars rather than have to actually touch grab. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRl_uWc2G1s&t=389.24s)]
