# ‘The Five’ react to potential al Qaeda resurgence in Afghanistan
**Fox News - The Five:** [August 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk)
*  As Biden takes a victory lap over the killing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=0.0s)]
*  of a top al-Qaeda leader, there are new concerns [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=2.34s)]
*  that Afghanistan could be a safe haven for terrorists. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=5.44s)]
*  I'm on all the worry. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=8.38s)]
*  I always say it wrong. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=10.34s)]
*  He was bin Laden's deputy, and the mastermind behind 9-11, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=11.88s)]
*  he was killed by a CIA drone strike [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=14.98s)]
*  while standing on a balcony in Kabul. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=17.72s)]
*  The CIA had tracked this top terrorist [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=19.56s)]
*  for months before taking him out in a wealthy area [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=22.62s)]
*  where he was staying with his family [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=25.76s)]
*  at the home of an aide to a Taliban leader. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=27.76s)]
*  Zawahiri's boldness to be out in the open [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=30.46s)]
*  raises alarms that al-Qaeda [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=32.86s)]
*  could be making a comeback in Afghanistan. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=35.06s)]
*  The White House says that's not the case. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  So we know that the Taliban was harboring [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=40.44s)]
*  the world's most wanted terrorist. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=44.28s)]
*  You guys gave a whole country to a bunch of people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=47.08s)]
*  that are on the FBI most wanted list. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=49.74s)]
*  What did you think was gonna happen? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Take issue with the premise that we gave a whole country [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=53.32000000000001s)]
*  to terrorist groups. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=56.02s)]
*  I'd encourage you to ask. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=58.42s)]
*  The Taliban is harboring the world's number one terrorist. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=60.28s)]
*  The question, Peter, the way you ask that, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=62.32s)]
*  it makes it sound like we owned Afghanistan a year ago. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=64.28s)]
*  It wasn't our country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=67.12s)]
*  It was an independent sovereign state. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=69.06s)]
*  And the president made a bold decision to end a war [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=71.36s)]
*  that had been going on for 20 years. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=73.94s)]
*  But we said at the time that as we depart Afghanistan, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=75.54s)]
*  we're gonna keep vigilant, we're gonna stay ready, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=79.64s)]
*  and we're not gonna let Afghanistan become a safe haven [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=82.38s)]
*  for terrorists who threaten our homeland. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=84.98s)]
*  It always was. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=88.26s)]
*  We don't own it, but we paid a lot of money for it [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=89.4s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=90.54s)]
*  So it was kind of like a long-term lease. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=91.9s)]
*  Hasn't it always been a haven for terrorists? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=95.0s)]
*  When did we ever think that we could trust the Taliban? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=96.98s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=99.48s)]
*  And we're not gonna debate whether we should have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=100.98s)]
*  pulled out or not. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=103.08s)]
*  That debate is over. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=103.92s)]
*  If a Republican's elected president next [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=105.22s)]
*  or another Democrat, neither president is gonna put [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  more soldiers back into Afghanistan. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=110.22s)]
*  So the question is now, how much intelligence [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=112.36s)]
*  and intelligence do we have in country [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=115.86s)]
*  to be able to pull up for aerial targeting from drones? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=118.5s)]
*  And it looks like we have some good assets on the ground [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  because we just wiped this guy off the map [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=124.66s)]
*  with this ninja bomb, a Hellfire blade missile. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=126.94s)]
*  These things just slice you up like that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=130.0s)]
*  It doesn't even explode. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=132.3s)]
*  Slap chop. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=133.48s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=134.32s)]
*  I wish I had known about ninja bombs before. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=135.78s)]
*  I would have been talking about that forever. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=137.88s)]
*  Yes, we're gonna see terrorist groups [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=141.12s)]
*  reconstitute in Afghanistan. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=143.46s)]
*  I think we should assume that, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=144.9s)]
*  but we just have to keep our eyes on them [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=146.44s)]
*  with surveillance up in the sky. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=149.44s)]
*  That's why we have such expensive satellites. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=151.48s)]
*  I'm worried also about the southern border [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=153.94s)]
*  because if all of a sudden, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=156.28s)]
*  you can have all these terrorist groups [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=157.72s)]
*  set up in Afghanistan, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=159.12s)]
*  what makes you think they're not setting up [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=160.32s)]
*  in the Northern Triangle, in Mexico? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=161.82s)]
*  And we just learned that 56 people on the terror watch list [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  were nabbed crossing the southern border. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=167.42s)]
*  And we have like hundreds of thousands of gotaways [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=169.2s)]
*  every six months. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=172.46s)]
*  So some terrorists from Afghanistan or from wherever [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=173.86s)]
*  has crossed into our southern border, into our country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=177.46s)]
*  And the Biden administration has not done anything about it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=180.1s)]
*  That's what worries me. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=182.34s)]
*  So if they hadn't done anything about it to this point, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  what is the plan going forward? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=186.5s)]
*  Because as much as people admire Admiral Kirby, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  and he does a much better job [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  than any other communications person, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=193.44s)]
*  in the federal government, especially right now, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  can we be assured that the United States [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  has a plan going forward for what might be brewing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=201.78s)]
*  in Afghanistan specifically, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=204.88s)]
*  not to mention other countries and regions? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=206.42s)]
*  They said their plan was always this over horizon capability, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  which when they pull out of Afghanistan was questioned [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  because we don't have any base nearby, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=215.22s)]
*  so she says we need to keep a base in Afghanistan [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=217.12s)]
*  to carry out these attacks. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=219.66s)]
*  So the White House is using this moment, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=221.1s)]
*  which is great for the country, great for the world, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=223.64s)]
*  to say that that plan is working. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=226.64s)]
*  Now, they're trying to spin their way out [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=228.48s)]
*  of the one year anniversary [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=230.52s)]
*  of the catastrophic Afghanistan withdrawal, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=231.76s)]
*  which was a complete disaster, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=234.26s)]
*  one of the largest hostage crises we've ever seen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=236.46s)]
*  There's still people trapped there who are gonna get out, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=239.04s)]
*  people who helped us in the war, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=241.14s)]
*  and it doesn't excuse that, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=243.0s)]
*  but it is good to know [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=244.88s)]
*  that they were able to take him out. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=246.0s)]
*  However, I was thinking about the Bo Bergdahl swap [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=247.68s)]
*  because when they did that big Rose Garden ceremony, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=250.24s)]
*  and it was like we got our guy back, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=252.92s)]
*  and they sold it as this really amazing thing, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=254.44s)]
*  and then people started asking questions [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=257.08s)]
*  about what actually happened, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=258.52s)]
*  and it turns out it wasn't what they said it was. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=259.88s)]
*  This is kind of similar, you know, great strike, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=262.4s)]
*  glad he's dead, but the fact that he was in Kabul [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=265.88s)]
*  just hanging out, being harbored by the Taliban [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=268.84s)]
*  raises lots of questions about what's happening there, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=271.6s)]
*  and Kirby said this afternoon [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=274.2s)]
*  that Al-Qaeda is not reconstituting itself there, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=276.58s)]
*  but this morning he said [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=279.7s)]
*  that they were actively planning attacks. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=280.68s)]
*  So it is a problem, but if they can handle it [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=282.4s)]
*  in the fashion that they did over the weekend, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=285.92s)]
*  then that's a very good thing, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  and it keeps soldiers off the ground as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=288.94s)]
*  Yes, and that is obviously the ultimate goal, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=290.86s)]
*  and to your point, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=293.1s)]
*  no president is going to commit ground troops to Afghanistan. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=294.18s)]
*  But, you know, did the botched withdrawal [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=298.66s)]
*  have an impact on who felt confident [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=301.98s)]
*  reconstituting over there? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=305.46s)]
*  You know, and if we had gotten out differently, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=307.3s)]
*  would we have a different outcome [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=310.22s)]
*  in terms of who's there right now? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=312.26s)]
*  Well, we do know that terrorists are paying attention [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=314.36s)]
*  to how we feel about things here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=316.58s)]
*  They're monitoring exactly what our media is saying [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=318.46s)]
*  about what our people who used to serve [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  in previous administrations, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=321.94s)]
*  the folks at institutes like Brookings [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=323.18s)]
*  at the Council on Foreign Relations, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  AEI, Heritage Everywhere, are saying [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=326.9s)]
*  about how we're handling our foreign policy decisions, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=329.26s)]
*  and the Afghanistan withdrawal was universally decried, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=332.06s)]
*  and everyone was talking about how we are weaker [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=335.78s)]
*  for the way that it was done, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=339.26s)]
*  not that it wasn't the right decision. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=340.34s)]
*  So I think they're certainly measuring that, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=341.78s)]
*  and to add to Katie's point about [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  how he was just hanging out on a balcony at home [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=345.7s)]
*  in the Capitol, his wife and daughter [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=348.94s)]
*  came a few months earlier, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=350.86s)]
*  and they were just roaming around [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=352.3s)]
*  like normal people there as well, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  and we know how valuable obviously families are [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=355.54s)]
*  of these kinds of terrorists. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=358.94s)]
*  What I think is interesting looking forward [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=360.3s)]
*  is what's next for al-Qaeda? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=362.54s)]
*  So the guy who was the number three guy, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=364.26s)]
*  Bin Laden and Al Zawahiri, and Al Addaoul, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=366.38s)]
*  I think is how you pronounce his name, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=369.66s)]
*  he actually lives in Iran, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=370.94s)]
*  which creates a whole other complication to this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  So people have questioned his credibility [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=375.74s)]
*  in terms of coming to the top of the heat because of that, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=377.56s)]
*  or does this mean that now we're going to be expanding, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=380.36s)]
*  and wouldn't Iran love to get in [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=383.48s)]
*  on this kind of conversation, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=385.72s)]
*  and then are we going to see a confluence [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=387.08s)]
*  of these states that are being run by terrorists [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  turning against US foreign policy? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=393.02s)]
*  Well, was this just a political move, Greg? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=395.72s)]
*  Was this just a way to distract [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=399.2s)]
*  from a horrible series of news cycles? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=402.1s)]
*  Because we're hearing that the CIA had eyeballs on him [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=405.16s)]
*  for months and months, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=408.64s)]
*  and they had developed basically a personality profile [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=410.0s)]
*  of what he was doing and when he was doing it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=413.44s)]
*  They knew where he was. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=415.1s)]
*  They built a model of the place he was staying in. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=416.18s)]
*  So the strike comes at a curious time. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=419.96s)]
*  Katie brings up the botched withdrawal [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=422.56s)]
*  was August one year ago. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=425.48s)]
*  So is this a way to not only distract from that, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=427.6s)]
*  but also some of these horrible numbers [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=431.2s)]
*  in terms of GDP and inflation? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=433.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you know, it was like the media was dying [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=437.2s)]
*  to write those Joe's got his groove back articles. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=440.52s)]
*  They were almost pre-written like obituaries. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=444.12s)]
*  It kind of sounded like it in a way. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=446.88s)]
*  And I think it's fair to be pissed off [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=448.76s)]
*  that this guy was hanging out casually for who knows how long. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=450.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, what in God's name is a white supremacist [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  doing in Afghanistan? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=455.79999999999995s)]
*  But it is a reminder. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=457.84s)]
*  It is a reminder that terrorism never goes away. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  It just grows a tail or it grows a head. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=460.96s)]
*  And when bad stuff happens under a president, it's on them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=463.0s)]
*  And when good stuff happens under them, it's on them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=466.32s)]
*  You blame the Democrats. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=470.0s)]
*  No, I think you got to give him credit. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=470.84s)]
*  But the problem with Joe, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=473.64s)]
*  what's hard about giving him credit [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=475.68s)]
*  is that he refuses responsibility for the bad stuff. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=478.48s)]
*  So it's kind of hard when something good happens [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=482.12s)]
*  to pat him on the back, even though I think we should, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=484.2s)]
*  even though we know that he probably had very little [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  to do with this. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=488.88s)]
*  He's kept in the dark like a rare mushroom. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=489.92s)]
*  He was totally against bin Laden, killing bin Laden. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=495.6s)]
*  I think he was just, he's very lucky. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=496.44s)]
*  And Soleimani as well. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=498.04s)]
*  Yes, but I do think it's a cost for celebration [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=499.16s)]
*  when somebody like this dies. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=501.32s)]
*  I think it's, I'm very reluctant to turn good news into bad. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=503.0s)]
*  Given the choices, you know, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=506.44s)]
*  I'd rather have Al Zahari dead than alive. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=508.0s)]
*  I wish we'd killed him 20 or 30 years ago, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=510.32s)]
*  20 years ago when he was in his 50s. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=513.48s)]
*  You know, he outlived Ashley Babbitt by 35 years. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=515.48s)]
*  I would rather have that reversed. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=518.32s)]
*  All right, well said. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=520.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=521.24s)]
*  John Hannity here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlfPWT6aKk&t=522.08s)]
