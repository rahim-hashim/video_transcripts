# Dems are 'stripped down' of state bullies, Watters argues
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18)
*  Well, look how the tables have turned. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=0.0s)]
*  The left ignored sky-high inflation [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=3.12s)]
*  for four years under Joe Biden, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=5.28s)]
*  and now those same desperate Democrats [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=7.08s)]
*  are trying to pin the January inflation report [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=9.84s)]
*  on President Trump, which rose 3% from a year earlier, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=12.48s)]
*  even though he was barely in office. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=16.64s)]
*  If there's one mandate Donald Trump had, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=19.8s)]
*  it was to fight inflation on day one. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=22.44s)]
*  Americans woke up this morning [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  to bad news for their bank accounts. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  They woke up to a grim reality [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=28.48s)]
*  that Donald Trump is not going to keep his promise [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  to lower costs. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=33.88s)]
*  They woke up. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=35.84s)]
*  Americans woke up to an era of Trumpflation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=37.36s)]
*  And unfortunately, this is only the beginning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=40.88s)]
*  And here's something you never believed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=45.2s)]
*  Joe Rogan and Joy Behar are in agreement. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=47.28s)]
*  The podcast superstar and co-host of The View [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=50.28s)]
*  both say Democrats are veering off their path to redemption. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=53.16s)]
*  They're not course correcting at all. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=58.0s)]
*  You know, they're saying stupid s***. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=60.04s)]
*  It's all nonsense. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=61.64s)]
*  Like, their understanding of social media [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  and the dynamics that you set up [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=66.4s)]
*  by having completely state-controlled mainstream media [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=68.04s)]
*  where they only said the narratives that you guys wanted, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=72.0s)]
*  they all said it in step. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=75.08s)]
*  Remember when Trump used to call in constantly? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=76.84s)]
*  He was on this show. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=79.88s)]
*  That is what they should be doing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Every time they should be ambushing the airwaves, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  the Democrats, get off your butts [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=85.36s)]
*  and start doing it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=87.36s)]
*  OK, you know, the liberal left, Jesse, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=90.56s)]
*  is really having a hard time dealing with Donald Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=94.84s)]
*  and all the successes in the 22 days that he spent in office. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=97.6s)]
*  And so they are saying right now that we've got to stop Trump, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=101.72s)]
*  we've got to slow him down, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=106.0s)]
*  we've got to call in and make sure people don't hear him. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=107.36s)]
*  When I met Emma's parents for the first time, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=112.0s)]
*  I was at the beach and I was in a bathing suit, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  and so were they. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  And I think it's the best way to meet someone [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=116.76s)]
*  because it strips you down of all of your BS. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=120.72s)]
*  They didn't see what car I was driving, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=125.0s)]
*  they didn't see what clothes I was wearing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=127.0s)]
*  This is the Democratic Party. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  They are naked. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=133.36s)]
*  They have nothing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=134.8s)]
*  This is who they are. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  They don't have the media. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=137.96s)]
*  They don't have special councils. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=139.6s)]
*  They don't have big tech to censor you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=141.88s)]
*  All of their traditional weapons are gone. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=145.04s)]
*  What you see is what you get. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=148.8s)]
*  And what you're seeing are people just singing and swearing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=151.08s)]
*  They are unpersuasive. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=156.44s)]
*  These are the kind of people that you see [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=158.68s)]
*  on a college campus, an activist who never matured, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=160.36s)]
*  and they never had to mature [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=164.36s)]
*  because they had all these things in their corners [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=166.2s)]
*  that allowed them to cheat and mobilize and cancel you [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=169.2s)]
*  and censor you and bully you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=173.28s)]
*  And that is gone. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=175.48s)]
*  So this is the stripped down version [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=177.16s)]
*  of a true modern day Democrat. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=180.2s)]
*  And it's embarrassing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=182.76s)]
*  And Greg's made the point, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  no one wants to have a beer with people like this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=185.6s)]
*  And you know, Dana, they still haven't come to grips [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=188.72s)]
*  with why they lost. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=191.92s)]
*  And Hakeem Jeffries actually came out and said, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=193.16s)]
*  we've got to find some common ground with them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, and I think if they continue to listen [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=200.28s)]
*  to people like Joy Behar, they'll stay in the doldrums. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=201.76s)]
*  Something that came out today is that the Democrats [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=206.92s)]
*  are mad at their outside groups [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=208.88s)]
*  because the outside groups are agitating them [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=211.32s)]
*  and they're saying, but there's nothing we can actually do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  We have no power. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=215.72s)]
*  We have no seats. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  We have no special councils. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=218.04s)]
*  We have nothing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=219.0s)]
*  We've lost everything. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=219.84s)]
*  And then you can't fix a mess like that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=221.72s)]
*  by just flooding the airwaves [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=224.0s)]
*  because what are you going to say? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=225.6s)]
*  All they're doing is cursing and singing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=226.6s)]
*  and they're not persuading anybody. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  It's like if you were, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=231.84s)]
*  it's like you were the chiefs in the Super Bowl. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  This is, I'm doing this fresh out of my head. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=238.88s)]
*  And Andy Reid in the locker room said, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=242.64s)]
*  just, you know, just do better. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=246.92s)]
*  And that was the only direction. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=250.44s)]
*  And they didn't give them a new game plan. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=252.0s)]
*  Then they were going to lose, but they lost anyway. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=253.76s)]
*  But they still made 22 points in the end. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=256.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=258.4s)]
*  I don't know why I was going with that exactly. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=259.23999999999995s)]
*  I should have never tried. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=260.08s)]
*  And I should ask permission. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  But the other thing is, for example, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=262.35999999999996s)]
*  today on the New York Times Daily podcast, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=263.67999999999995s)]
*  they talked about the constitutional crisis [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=266.56s)]
*  that's happening. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=268.28s)]
*  And what they do though is they throw their hands [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=269.28s)]
*  at the end, they say, well, I guess no one cares [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=272.08s)]
*  because nobody's as smart as we are. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=273.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=275.88s)]
*  And they don't look in the mirror and touch some grass [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  and figure out what's really going on. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  Can you tell us if they're smart, Greg? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=280.76s)]
*  You know what this is? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=282.67999999999995s)]
*  This isn't left or right anymore. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  It's before and after. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  There's no way they can go back. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=287.8s)]
*  The old concept of how to defeat Trump is 2023. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not Trump they need to defeat. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=296.12s)]
*  It's themselves. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=298.08s)]
*  When you go to a shrink with a problem, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=299.6s)]
*  my wife drives me nuts. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=302.32s)]
*  The shrink isn't going to say, well, let me talk to her. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=304.04s)]
*  I'll straighten her out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=306.44s)]
*  No, the shrink says to you, OK, we [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=308.04s)]
*  need to address your behavior so you can react differently [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=310.24s)]
*  to these stresses. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=314.52s)]
*  And maybe that'll help solve the problems. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=316.2s)]
*  They haven't yet gotten to that point. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=318.56s)]
*  But they have to reconcile that there's no way to go back. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I think America is learning, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=324.36s)]
*  and I think it's through Doge, especially [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=327.12s)]
*  through the transparency, educating themselves [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=328.76s)]
*  that all that crap that we went through during the Biden years [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=331.56s)]
*  and stuff, it didn't have to be. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=335.36s)]
*  Trans, Soros, open border, managed decline of a country, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=337.64s)]
*  we were told that that's how it was going to be, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  and you were going to love it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=345.56s)]
*  You were going to love it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=347.4s)]
*  This is just how it is. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=348.4s)]
*  And now it's like, Trump comes in and goes, no. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=349.92s)]
*  In fact, we can get rid of this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=352.2s)]
*  We can stop that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=353.52s)]
*  We can do this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=354.16s)]
*  Things are going to get better. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=354.8s)]
*  You're going to feel better. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=355.52s)]
*  Everything's going to be great. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=356.2s)]
*  And people are going like, I ain't going back. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=356.96s)]
*  There's no way you can go back after this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=359.4s)]
*  So the Dems, I think, are pining for a dead lover. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=361.36s)]
*  But just go to the cemetery. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=365.8s)]
*  Lay some flowers. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=367.96s)]
*  Your best bet is to move on. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=368.92s)]
*  See the world for what it is. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=371.0s)]
*  And it's not what the media told you it was. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=372.72s)]
*  Part of this responsibility is on the media. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=374.92s)]
*  They told them the world was totally different. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=376.72s)]
*  Dead lover, Harold. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=380.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  That's a tough one. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  I'd say a couple things. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=385.2s)]
*  First, what, Dana, your analogy was spot on. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  And what I think you wanted to say after you said do better, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=390.92s)]
*  that means just keep doing the same thing you're doing [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=393.8s)]
*  but try to do it better. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=396.04s)]
*  That's what Democrats are doing, and it's ineffective. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=397.24s)]
*  The campaigning that we did during the last election, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  it didn't work. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  The strategy didn't work because the message, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=404.08s)]
*  the substance wasn't there. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=406.76s)]
*  You have to develop new substance. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=408.24s)]
*  Now, President Trump, unfortunately, today, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=409.56s)]
*  I say unfortunately because I didn't [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=412.88s)]
*  want the inflation numbers to come out like they did. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=414.32s)]
*  I was hoping for inflation to be going down, not up, which it is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=417.44s)]
*  President Trump immediately blamed President Biden. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=424.36s)]
*  But it's where it is. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  I didn't want that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=427.08s)]
*  So Democrats, a message is needed. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=428.0s)]
*  Why not develop a tax plan that Democrats support [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=430.96s)]
*  that maybe has no tax on tips, has better tax treatment [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=433.84s)]
*  for middle class America, better tax treatment for main street [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=436.96s)]
*  businesses in the country, as opposed to singing [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=439.84s)]
*  outside of the Capitol? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=442.67999999999995s)]
*  Why not do this in a rural area, in an urban area [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=443.67999999999995s)]
*  across the country? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=445.88s)]
*  On border security, it is interesting. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  As we sit here tonight, Republicans in the House [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=448.84s)]
*  and Republicans in the Senate are in disagreement [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=451.4s)]
*  over what Mr. Holman wants and the president wants [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  for border security money. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=456.55999999999995s)]
*  They want $175 or $180 billion. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=457.64s)]
*  Lindsey Graham wants to give it to them, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=460.52s)]
*  but Mr. Speaker Johnson can't get the votes in the House. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=462.36s)]
*  Highlight these differences as opposed to the nonsense [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=465.04s)]
*  that you're talking about. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  And Judge, your lead in should be the thing that Democrats, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=469.2s)]
*  if you're a coach and you have them in the locker room, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=472.2s)]
*  you put up on the wall Joe Rogan, Joy Behar. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=474.8s)]
*  They're in agreement. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=478.12s)]
*  Why the heck can't we get an agreement on something [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=479.32s)]
*  to make the country better and stronger [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=482.44s)]
*  and make the middle class realize that we have a voice, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  not only a serious voice, but we have answers to their problems? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  That was wonderful, Harry. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=491.88s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, Your Honor. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=492.96s)]
*  Up next, the dealmaker in chief, Trump, bringing Americans home, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=494.6s)]
*  and he's ready to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqCcrqwas18&t=499.0s)]
