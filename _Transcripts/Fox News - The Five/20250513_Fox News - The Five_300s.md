# 'The Five': Trump's making it rain deals in the desert
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo)
*  President Trump making it rain deals in the desert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=0.0s)]
*  47 pumping the YMCA and God bless the USA as he dazzled Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  securing $600 billion in investments from the Saudis and the largest arms deal ever at 142 billion bucks. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=8.8s)]
*  The Saudis rolling out the royal purple carpet and extended a warm welcome by having white Arabian horses flank his motorcade. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=16.0s)]
*  Salesman Trump pitching a shared golden age of prosperity for the US and the Middle East. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=23.84s)]
*  Today we reaffirm this important bond and we take the next steps to make our relationship closer, stronger and more powerful than ever before. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=29.84s)]
*  The Biden administration, the worst administration in the history of our country, by the way, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=39.24s)]
*  spurred our most trusted and longstanding Gulf partners and I can say partners worldwide. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=44.24s)]
*  We have none stronger and now nobody like the gentleman that's right before me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=51.440000000000005s)]
*  He's your greatest representative, greatest representative. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=57.940000000000005s)]
*  And if I didn't like him, I'd get out of here so fast. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=61.84s)]
*  You know that, don't you? He knows me well. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=65.84s)]
*  I do. I like him a lot. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=68.84s)]
*  I like him too much. That's why we give so much, you know, too much. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=71.34s)]
*  I like you too much. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=75.64s)]
*  Dopey Dems, on the other hand, can't bring themselves to celebrate all the delicious deals Trump's cooking up for the country. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=78.94s)]
*  This is President Trump's corruption tour of the Middle East. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=85.64s)]
*  He is going to the Gulf in order to collect tribute. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=89.04s)]
*  What's happening here is an extraordinary level of corruption. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=93.44s)]
*  We shouldn't pretend this is business as usual. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=97.04s)]
*  Trump is not asking for any benefit to the American people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=99.14s)]
*  He's not asking for any movement towards peace in the region. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=102.34s)]
*  He's asking for cash. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=105.84s)]
*  So Dana, what's wrong with securing investment deals from our partners in the Middle East? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=109.84s)]
*  Well, what's interesting is that for Chris Murphy, it's like for the last four years, you were championing the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  And what did that do? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  It drove up inflation and it had all these green new scams in it in which you could give to all of your donors, many of whom now have gone bankrupt. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  So I don't like the idea of the plane. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=131.44s)]
*  But we're not talking about that right now because I don't think that's necessarily happening. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=135.24s)]
*  What's interesting on this is that when President Trump signed the economic agreement this morning, he signs the economic agreement. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=138.54s)]
*  Then Secretary of Defense Pete Heg says signs the defense agreement. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=144.74s)]
*  A lot of the economic agreement and the defense agreement are intertwined because Saudi wants protection. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=148.14s)]
*  And if you're going to get the protection, you need to have the weaponry and the weaponry is made by us. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=155.04s)]
*  And so that is a good thing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=160.04s)]
*  And it's been a pretty good week for the president's economic agenda. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=161.04s)]
*  Aside from that, the inflation number was good today. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  The one of the big banks, JP Morgan, really scaled back its projection for a recession after that China deal got announced for 90 days. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=167.44s)]
*  And House Republicans are actually really moving forward on the big, beautiful bill that could get done. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=177.74s)]
*  So I would say it's a pretty good week and it's only Tuesday. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  It's only Tuesday. And that tax bill will really juice things. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=184.94s)]
*  Greg, a lot of people don't know this about you, but you require your rides to be flanked by white Arabian horses when you arrive here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes. I was a little worried about that because he also has the mobile McDonald's. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=194.74s)]
*  Yes. So it makes you wonder what meat they're using. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  They never rolled out the red carpet for Joe Biden because they were worried about the cleaning bill. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=201.84s)]
*  But you know, it's interesting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=206.54s)]
*  So he has this mobile McDonald's following him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=207.84s)]
*  It's just like a regular McDonald's, except the Hamburglar is missing a hand for stealing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=211.24s)]
*  They do that. They do that there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=217.34s)]
*  I think you're right. You know, this is a great week. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=219.24s)]
*  It's only Tuesday because it says a lot about the mindset with Trump. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=221.24s)]
*  It feels like almost anything is possible because he's a doer. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=225.44s)]
*  He's not a talker. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=229.24s)]
*  He's a man of action. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=231.34s)]
*  He's got aspirational designs for the country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=232.24s)]
*  He wants to be the greatest president ever and that directly benefits us. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=235.24s)]
*  Even if it's for his own ego, it doesn't matter if they align properly with our needs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  He's America's lawyer, America's agent. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=244.24s)]
*  He's in the room on our behalf. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=246.84s)]
*  Doesn't seem like an existential risk to me, Marie, but maybe you see it differently. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=249.84s)]
*  And he doesn't care what the world thinks. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=253.94s)]
*  That's a liberal thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=256.64s)]
*  Successful people do not care what other people think or else they'd never be successful. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=257.74s)]
*  And if you compare this again to the previous administration, that was lip service. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=262.74s)]
*  This is real service. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=266.64s)]
*  You know, anything is possible with Trump. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  The Democrats never thought anything was possible. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think I realized why. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  To them, winning the election is the job. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  For Trump, the job comes after the election. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=280.54s)]
*  And I think that's when you when we were talking about Biden, they didn't care that he was [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=284.24s)]
*  barely alive because he already won. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=289.14s)]
*  I'm Mike Harkness. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0hm4q7muo&t=292.74s)]
