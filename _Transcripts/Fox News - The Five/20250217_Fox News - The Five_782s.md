*  We brought it back and it's been less than four weeks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=20.2s)]
*  So you'll see what we do in in a little period of time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=23.42s)]
*  It's going to only get better, but this is very exciting. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=27.16s)]

*  People love that sport and they're wonderful people that run it and they had a little rain [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=31.56s)]
*  delay, but we'll go home and watch it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=39.04s)]
*  I guess some of you will and others will try and create peace throughout the world. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=40.8s)]
*  Do you have any questions? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=46.04s)]
*  President Trump's also driving laps around the Democrats who can't keep up with his record [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  breaking first month in office. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=53.96s)]

*  Check this out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  63 percent favor federal government's recognition of only two sexes, a 60 percent favor deporting [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  immigrants who entered the United States illegally. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Is there anything you are seeing that Trump is doing that you are in favor of? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=72.44s)]
*  Let me say as it relates to all of those issues, we're just at the beginning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=77.88s)]
*  The price of eggs is skyrocketing out of control. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=83.84s)]
*  Inflation is on the way up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=86.48s)]
*  That was the core promise has been broken with respect to immigration. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=88.4s)]
*  Listen, we have to secure the border. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=92.44s)]
*  Judge, you need will go to you to talk about the Daytona 500. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=97.2s)]
*  I know you like to put the pedal to the metal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=100.0s)]
*  It's good to see the president out there at an event like this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=103.72s)]
*  We haven't seen Joe Biden do something like that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=106.44s)]
*  When I saw the president, when all of us saw the president at the Daytona 500, I couldn't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=109.84s)]
*  help but think what it was like. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=115.32s)]
*  Remember during COVID, we all wanted to leave our homes or our apartments and wanted to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=117.32s)]
*  go out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  We wanted to go to the movies. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  We wanted to do something public. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  And then that movie came out, Top Gun Maverick with Tom Cruise. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  And we felt like it's America again. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=129.24s)]
*  We're out there and we're flying jets. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=131.72s)]
*  Well, I had the same reaction when I saw the president in the beast on the on the racetrack [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=133.48s)]
*  there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=139.2s)]
*  You know, it was Donald Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=140.2s)]
*  It was, you know, full throttle. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=141.6s)]
*  And you know, we came out of the doldrums, you know, four years of dark Joe Biden not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=144.56s)]
*  moving. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=149.92s)]
*  He got elected behind a mask. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=150.92s)]
*  He got elected hiding in the basement. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  And we're seeing the president at the Super Bowl at the UFC at the Army-Navy game. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=155.28s)]
*  And now at Daytona, it's not even four weeks yet. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=159.28s)]
*  It's four weeks today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=162.2s)]
*  But you know, the same spirit of America that brought us out of COVID when we were [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=164.4s)]
*  so excited is what I'm seeing now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  He's energetic. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=171.28s)]
*  He's vibrant. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=172.28s)]
*  He's nonstop. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=173.28s)]
*  He's the kind of president who is not scared. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=174.28s)]
*  The guy took a bullet. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=176.76s)]
*  He's not scared to walk out in public. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  He was at the infield. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=179.6s)]
*  He was in public there when he was talking to the press. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  And we should be, I think, so grateful that he won, that we now feel energized ourselves. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  And I have to tell you, there's one cute little story there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=191.16s)]
*  Carolina, who was with her grandfather, President Trump, I guarantee that in a couple of years, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=194.28s)]
*  she's going to be driving the beast. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=201.0s)]
*  That little girl that the president was holding hands with is the toughest, strongest, fiercest [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=202.44s)]
*  little girl I've ever met. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=207.08s)]
*  And I'm loving what I'm seeing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  And you know, the interesting thing is the president is turning these things into his [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=212.04s)]
*  own rallies. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you got a crowd of what, almost a half a million people baked in. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=216.48s)]
*  Greg, did you watch the Daytona 500? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=221.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=223.76s)]
*  You know, if Joe had done that, it would have been in a hearse and the blinker would still [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=224.76s)]
*  be on. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=228.32s)]
*  Of course, if it was Kamala, they'd stop for a roadie. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=229.32s)]
*  Trump has essentially destroyed the Democratic Party, but before that, he also destroyed [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  the Republican Party. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=238.27999999999997s)]
*  So all the Dems are experiencing is what we already went through. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=239.44s)]
*  You just need to admit that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=244.48s)]
*  Sometimes I just want to shake the remaining sane Democrats and say, what are you? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=246.72s)]
*  Because right now, for the last eight years, you were anti-Trump and that's not doing any [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=253.6s)]
*  good. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=257.28s)]
*  You've indulged the whims of deranged activists for eight years. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=258.28s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=260.8s)]
*  And your whole hoax matrix has imploded. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=261.8s)]
*  Look at how quickly the Pete Hegseth hoax just imploded. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  He's drinking at the podium. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=267.44s)]
*  That thing was gone before it had any traction. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=269.12s)]
*  So I said this on Friday, I'm going to keep saying it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=272.8s)]
*  My new role here is to give Democrats advice because we get the most viewers. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=276.48s)]
*  Rather than trashing them, I'm going to help them because that's the kind of person I am. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=281.04s)]
*  You really are so nice. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=285.0s)]
*  First of all, the Dems have to let go of what's killing them, which is obviously the remaining [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=286.0s)]
*  wokeness. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=290.6s)]
*  And I go back to my zombie analogy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=291.6s)]
*  In every zombie movie, the hero struggles against becoming a zombie when in fact, if [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=293.56s)]
*  he just lets the zombie bite him, it's over with. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=298.56s)]
*  The zombies leave you alone and you can work your way up the zombie ranks, become a zombie [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=302.6s)]
*  bureaucrat, get a good zombie consulting fee. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=307.16s)]
*  That's what the Dems did with the woke virus. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=310.08s)]
*  They let themselves get bit rather than resist. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=312.08s)]
*  That only works if all of America complied, but they didn't. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=316.28s)]
*  So now you've got to un-bite yourself. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=319.16s)]
*  Now in order to do that, and this is the, Jessica can I think agree with me on this, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=322.32s)]
*  the Dems live off praise. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=328.06s)]
*  Republicans don't because we are so used to being called evil. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  We've been called evil since day one. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=334.66s)]
*  Reagan was compared to Hitler. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=337.1s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=338.58s)]
*  So we're used to being the bad guy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=339.58s)]
*  So the new Democratic party has to realize that their survival will not require praise. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=341.62s)]
*  Praise doesn't build anything. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=347.48s)]
*  You learned that from 2024. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=349.58s)]
*  No amount of accolades from the woke created anything. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=351.66s)]
*  Didn't create jobs. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  It didn't make safer streets. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=357.46s)]
*  It didn't stop any wars. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=358.85999999999996s)]
*  It was ephemeral. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=361.11999999999995s)]
*  It just dealt with your emotions. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=362.11999999999995s)]
*  So you have to stop operating from worrying about activists being upset with you because [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=364.58s)]
*  it doesn't help. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=371.96s)]
*  Your big challenge, and this is, we talked about this in the green room a while ago. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  The big challenge, Trump has found the middle ground on every issue and he called it common [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=377.97999999999996s)]
*  sense. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=383.02s)]
*  So what that did is it imploded the left versus right structure. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=384.02s)]
*  You can't get left or right on the high ground. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=388.4s)]
*  That's why it's a high ground. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=390.38s)]
*  So there's no left or right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=391.38s)]
*  So how do you outflank that? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=393.2s)]
*  You can't. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  So you end up having to find new ground. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  They need to find issues that Trump hasn't already picked over. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  And that's a challenge because it's like when it comes to issues for the Democrats, it's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=404.7s)]
*  like going to Walmart on Saturday after Black Friday. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=408.53999999999996s)]
*  Trump has gone through everything. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=412.18s)]
*  So I mean, there are some issues that are going to come up that the Democrats could [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=414.18s)]
*  reshape their party around, but I don't want to help them yet. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=419.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's not water pressure in the showers. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=424.38s)]
*  It's not straws, Jessica. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=426.5s)]
*  You guys are going to have to dig deep. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=428.22s)]
*  Your name was invoked. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=430.72s)]
*  Does your party thrive on praise? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=431.72s)]
*  I mean, I like it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=436.5s)]
*  I love some affirmation. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=439.1s)]
*  My mom texts me every day during the show so that I have a friend. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=440.34s)]
*  My mom does and I have an enemy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=445.14s)]
*  My mom and your mom. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=447.73999999999995s)]
*  She still loves you, but obviously is hugely disappointed. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=450.7s)]
*  Would be nice to hear it from her once in a while. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=453.38s)]
*  I'll message her and say that you'd like to hear from her in a positive direction. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=456.9s)]
*  I don't hate everything that Greg said. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=461.21999999999997s)]
*  I also just think on these issues, you know, you could take the L and be kind of magnanimous [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=463.41999999999996s)]
*  about it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  I would say if you are on the wrong side of even a 60-40 issue, I know Dana, we go with [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=470.86s)]
*  80-20 or 90-10, but some of these where you just say we don't need to have this fight [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=477.3s)]
*  right now. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=483.46000000000004s)]
*  The American people have spoken. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  We're not going to be showing up at the ballot box for another two years. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=485.46000000000004s)]
*  Let's see how this goes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=488.86s)]
*  This is what my party is about. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=490.5s)]
*  And Greg, when you say let's find some new issues, I think the issues are going to be [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=492.62s)]
*  the same. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=496.5s)]
*  People vote on the economy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=497.5s)]
*  They vote on immigration. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=498.5s)]
*  We need to take out what our position is, have common sense messaging that really lifts [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=500.98s)]
*  up the average American, get back working class voters and go from there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=503.90000000000003s)]
*  I do want to say something about Daytona. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=508.64000000000004s)]
*  And you know, I'm fully aware that President Trump, this is a big victory. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  They have control of all three branches, well, not branches, but houses, even though it's [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=515.9200000000001s)]
*  only a slim majority in the House. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=523.04s)]
*  But you know, a lot of Americans were having a really bad weekend because of these storms. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=525.32s)]
*  So over 10 people passed away because of these storms that were hitting the eastern side [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=532.2600000000001s)]
*  of the United States, nine alone dying in Kentucky, people drowning in their cars, tens [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=537.6400000000001s)]
*  of thousands without power. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=542.4200000000001s)]
*  President Trump signed the emergency declaration, but he didn't, as far as I know, put out a [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=545.0s)]
*  statement. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=548.6s)]
*  He didn't go out there. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=549.6s)]
*  He's not going to meet the families, as far as I have heard. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  And you say if Joe Biden had done this. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden had shown up at the Daytona 500 while there were people living under emergency [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=555.08s)]
*  declarations and passing away in Georgia, a tree fell into a guy's house and ended up [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=560.48s)]
*  killing him. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=566.36s)]
*  Do you think this is a fair comparison? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=567.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=568.92s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=569.92s)]
*  You're taking, this is not a hurricane event. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=570.92s)]
*  You're talking about storms. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=576.44s)]
*  So he needs to respond to every single death? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=577.88s)]
*  No. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=581.0s)]
*  Then he wouldn't be president. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=582.0s)]
*  Well, he needs to, I think, say something when the whole point was criticizing Joe Biden [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=583.0s)]
*  for absolutely everything that he ever did. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=587.44s)]
*  Because he never did anything. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=589.64s)]
*  Start with North Carolina. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=591.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=592.6s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=593.6s)]
*  He never did a thing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=594.6s)]
*  We've gone through it multiple times about how quickly he signed emergency declarations. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=595.6s)]
*  How about East Palestine? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=599.52s)]
*  How about you just say that maybe you shouldn't be driving around a race car track when this [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=600.6s)]
*  is going on. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=606.68s)]
*  But that's, you know what that is? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=607.68s)]
*  You know what that is? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=608.68s)]
*  When there is news going on in the five, how dare you have one more thing? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, people go, oh my God, the economy's in danger and they're doing a pet segment. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=613.8399999999999s)]
*  No, we also do 57 minutes of everything else. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=618.12s)]
*  Trump does so many things in a day that him driving around in a car doesn't even amount [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  to 1%. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=626.4s)]
*  And they had already done the disaster declaration. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=629.4s)]
*  I don't think anybody in Kentucky thinks that they're not doing it, not going to be there [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=631.88s)]
*  for them. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=636.24s)]
*  They're the ones who went into North Carolina in the first week of the administration because [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=637.64s)]
*  the Biden administration, they felt like they had been left behind. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=641.84s)]
*  I don't want to talk about that because I think it's a ridiculous thing, especially [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=645.2s)]
*  East Palestine. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=647.8s)]
*  They never went. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=648.8s)]
*  And then it became a whole issue of they never went. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=649.8s)]
*  And we didn't say that he that it was not OK for him to go ahead and like ride his bike [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=651.16s)]
*  at the beach. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=656.88s)]
*  We do a show every Monday morning. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=658.12s)]
*  So that means on Sunday you have to look for material for what you're going to talk about [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=659.8s)]
*  in the morning. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=664.92s)]
*  And then we have the news of the weekend. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=665.92s)]
*  In the last three weeks, we've been able to say, wow, Trump did this and he went to that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=668.4799999999999s)]
*  And now we have NASCAR. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=672.36s)]
*  And then also, oh, you know what? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=673.36s)]
*  He's going to do tariffs and he's doing something else. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=674.36s)]
*  And there were raids in Colorado. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=675.8399999999999s)]
*  And it's like there's so much news. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=677.9599999999999s)]
*  The visuals of what this White House is doing are so important. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  And it's such a contrast. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=684.16s)]
*  Think about flopping on the beach for an entire for four days. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=685.8399999999999s)]
*  Think of the fact like falling off a bike. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  All of those things are the visuals that stick in your mind. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=692.5999999999999s)]
*  And for the younger people who are now thinking, oh, let me give the Republican Party a chance. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=695.92s)]
*  This might be the first time in their lives that they ever felt positive about America, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=701.2399999999999s)]
*  that they are enjoying patriotism. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=705.52s)]
*  So you've got the hockey game Saturday night. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=707.1199999999999s)]
*  I was like, wait, what is this thing again? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=709.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  The big hockey game. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=712.1999999999999s)]
*  And everybody's watching it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  Everyone's into it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=714.92s)]
*  And we had like lots of different generations at this one party on Saturday night. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=715.92s)]
*  I was looking around going, America can feel like a great place to be. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=718.68s)]
*  And you need a little bit of leadership. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=724.28s)]
*  You don't have to be obsessed with your government. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=725.5999999999999s)]
*  You just have to feel a little bit of that positivity. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=727.3199999999999s)]
*  The Democrats have shown that they're on the wrong side of every issue. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=729.4799999999999s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, Hakeem Jeffries is worried about egg prices. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  The thing is that on inflation, my last point, I know we're running late. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAogmRB-J_0&t=736.0s)]
