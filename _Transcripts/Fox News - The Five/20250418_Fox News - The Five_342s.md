# Greg Gutfeld: AOC has never introduced a fresh idea in her life
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE)
*  Should Kamala say never mind for president and is AOC gonna be the frontrunner? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=0.0s)]
*  I think it's just way too early for this and I think it's more likely that Kamala runs for California governor than she runs for president [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=5.54s)]
*  Again, I know you floated the idea [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=12.74s)]
*  She could do governor and then she could do president [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=13.76s)]
*  But I really feel like Democrats are just in you know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=16.64s)]
*  Crouching mode trying to figure out what's going on and the dividing line in the party right now is who's being active and who's being? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=21.76s)]
*  Passive and AOC is being the most active. That's why she's the most talked about she's having this enormous rally is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=28.24s)]
*  fundraising nine million dollars, I think it was 9.2 million maybe in the first quarter and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=35.16s)]
*  Everybody just wants to see their representatives with a spine people who are saying we're gonna stand up the Trump administration [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=40.24s)]
*  People that are galvanizing folks and she did she and Bernie have one of the more compelling working-class messages [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  They sound like Trump a lot of the time when they're talking like that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=52.6s)]
*  Maybe a spine day and of it also with some hypocrisy working class, but also raking in $700 tickets at Coachella [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=56.56s)]
*  I don't know private jets [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=62.82s)]
*  They're in crouching mode. It's more like fetal position [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=66.08s)]
*  I mean it is bad and Doug Sosnick is a great political analyst during the Clinton administration [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=68.84s)]
*  It's a big deep dive in Politico today [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=73.92s)]
*  and one of the things he says is anytime after a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  Presidency is one like Trump winning then the next couple of years even possibly four years [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=78.68s)]
*  There's really only a party and a half [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  so it's the Republican Party and then half a Democratic Party because they might try to win the midterms but I gotta say the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=86.08s)]
*  Republicans have to be pretty happy that David Hogg is that the DNC saying we are going to destroy all the moderate Democrats and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=91.64s)]
*  Bernie and AOC are like sounds good to me [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=98.68s)]
*  Also is pretty cute that the media thinks that the rally that Trump had at Madison Square Garden was nothing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=101.08s)]
*  And yet we're supposed to be so excited that they can sort of like half fill an auditorium [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, or in a concert that everyone was going to anyway. Yes, right for all the musical acts [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  So Charlie they say this is the shock full with AOC coming in second place [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=116.96s)]
*  But based on what Dana just said about David Hogg trying to destroy anyone with common sense left in the Democratic Party [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=121.08s)]
*  I'm actually not surprised at all. Yeah. I didn't think I was much of a shock either [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=126.72s)]
*  You know, obviously the the Harris numbers are just name ID is all it is and people are and I agree with Jessica [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=130.48s)]
*  They're just kind of confused more than anything else [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=135.4s)]
*  AOC has all of the credibility for her side because she taught says things that nobody else says [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=138.8s)]
*  She draws great crowds good energy lots of charisma. All this stuff is really great for them. I think that she [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=144.68s)]
*  could be a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=152.24s)]
*  Probably if I had to bet on somebody right now, I would probably better attend to bet on her [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=154.68s)]
*  the problem is that she does not unify the party and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=159.52s)]
*  When you look back at what the the the party elders did to Bernie Sanders [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=163.92s)]
*  they're gonna try to do to her too and if you think Kamala Harris had a problem with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=168.72s)]
*  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro being Jewish wait till you see the problem that that this woman has with Jews in her party [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=174.28s)]
*  it's gonna get very ugly and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=181.52s)]
*  And and you're not gonna be able to paper over these things the way you know, that was the gift of Barack Obama [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=184.04s)]
*  He was able to paper over all the differences in the party and everybody loved him [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=189.16s)]
*  She's I don't think she's gonna be able to do that. She's not a uniter Craig [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=193.96s)]
*  For AOC. Yeah, but first I think we should have a moratorium on white dorks on zoom calls [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=197.92s)]
*  You know, we have like done we have fastest and we have fan mail and I just can't listen to those Nate [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  Silvers in these solicit people just bites into this glorious show AOC [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=210.28s)]
*  What she's kind of fun [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=216.26s)]
*  In a you know a silly but earnest wrong, but adorable way [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  She's like your daughter when she comes back from her first year at Brown full of half-baked half opinions [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=222.98s)]
*  In need of some gentle patient deprogramming [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  But people have to realize new faces doesn't mean new ideas drives me crazy [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=233.1s)]
*  AOC has never introduced a fresh idea or [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=238.62s)]
*  Issue in her life [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=242.54s)]
*  She the reason why she gets along with Bernie is because they're she's like an 80 year old leftist in a used bookstore [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=244.26s)]
*  I mean, you know, she may look she may look fresh, but she's as stale as an abandoned futon on the street [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=250.7s)]
*  It's like I listened to her. I go I heard that at Berkeley in 1983 [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=257.62s)]
*  So their problem is and the reason why they don't have any ideas is they operate on half opinions [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=261.94s)]
*  Like what if we get rid of cash bail? Oh, let's do it. What happens you have repeat criminals wreaking havoc [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  What if we have sanctuary cities? Hey, let's do it. What happens you have rapists and killers, you know finding sanctuary safe haven [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=274.68s)]
*  What if we give trans rights rights that we don't have? Well, you just ruined women's sports [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=281.92s)]
*  You ruin safe spaces you make kids lives hell [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=287.04s)]
*  But you don't think about they never think about what their ideas incentivize that would be nice [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=289.76s)]
*  So where their idea is gonna come from? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=296.02s)]
*  Trump the only way they're gonna create a message is based on whatever Trump does [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=298.26s)]
*  So I have some slogans for the Democrat Party Wow the Democrat Party when you're tired of success [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  The Democrat Party make America suck again [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  Democrat Party the first choice for [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=314.82s)]
*  illegals vandals and dead people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=318.06s)]
*  Well, thank you for not using the word oligarchy [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=321.34s)]
*  All of our games not using any of those [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1AwBnpoeE&t=323.94s)]
