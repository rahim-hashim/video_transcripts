# Did Crockett cross the line? Dallas rep under fire for mocking Texas governor #fox #shorts #news
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI)
*  Crockett went as low as humanly possible by mocking Governor Greg Abbott for being paralyzed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=0.0s)]
*  We in these hot a** Texas streets, honey. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=5.14s)]
*  Y'all know we got Governor Hot Wheels down there. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=9.68s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=14.64s)]
*  And the only thing hot about him is that he is a hot a** mess, honey. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=15.64s)]
*  Of course, Crockett now claims Hot Wheels was about shipping migrants out of the state. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=23.84s)]
*  Don't you get that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=28.8s)]
*  Not the governor's condition. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=29.8s)]
*  If only there was video that perfectly encapsulates the liberal inability to land a lick on MAGA. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=31.48s)]
*  Turns out we have one. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=36.32s)]
*  Roll it, Bjorn. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Never get tired of that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  So Dana, Governor Hot Wheels, she claims that it had nothing to do with the fact that he [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=58.08s)]
*  actually moves by wheels in a wheelchair and he's good looking. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=64.96s)]
*  Her cleanup was worse. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=69.44s)]
*  Was one of the worst things I've ever seen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=72.44s)]
*  It was super dumb. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=73.44s)]
*  So basically she's saying, I didn't do it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=74.44s)]
*  And even I did do it though, we're the victims of it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=77.48s)]
*  And I think that the Democrats have a problem. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=81.56s)]
*  Remember Maxine Waters back in 2019 and 2020. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=85.64s)]
*  She had all of those things of get up in their faces. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=90.92s)]
*  And that was actually really helpful for Republicans and it helped over the years. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7FO2EyjXI&t=91.92s)]
