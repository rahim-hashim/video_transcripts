# Jesse Watters accuses Gavin Newsom of trying to pivot
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo)
*  Well, well, well, it looks like someone is thirsty for a presidential run. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=0.0s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom is breaking with the left-wing lunatics in his party, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=5.4s)]
*  making common sense on men playing in women's sports while chatting with Charlie Kirk on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=11.0s)]
*  his new podcast. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=16.62s)]
*  You right now should come out and be like, you know what, the young man who's about to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=18.66s)]
*  win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that shouldn't happen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=22.52s)]
*  You as the governor should step out and say no. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=27.42s)]
*  No, and I appreciate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=29.24s)]
*  But like, would you do something like that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Would you say no men in female sports? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=32.04s)]
*  Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  I completely agree with you on that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=35.08s)]
*  So that's easy to call out the unfairness of that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=36.52s)]
*  Okay, Jesse, what is behind Gavin Newsom's sudden shift on his opinion regarding men [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=39.2s)]
*  and women's sports? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=46.44s)]
*  It has nothing to do with running for president. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=47.44s)]
*  I'm sure of it, Judge. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  I went to school with this kid. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=50.92s)]
*  He was a huge UNLV fan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=52.56s)]
*  Wore a hat every single day. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=54.56s)]
*  Remember running Rebels? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=56.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=57.08s)]
*  They won, undefeated. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=58.08s)]
*  They get to the championship game. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=59.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=61.12s)]
*  Larry Johnson and Duke beats them. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=62.12s)]
*  Next day, kid comes in with a Duke hat. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  It was so blatantly obvious this guy's a front runner. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=67.56s)]
*  And you get a little whiff of that from Newsom. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=70.88s)]
*  Like he's obviously trying to pivot here, but it doesn't have to be this blatant. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  But I have to say something. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=77.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=79.36s)]
*  I like him. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=80.36s)]
*  I don't want to like him. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=81.36s)]
*  I actually hate that I like him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=82.36s)]
*  But I met him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=84.24s)]
*  I shouldn't have met him. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=85.24s)]
*  Because when I met him, he was kind of funny. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  I made fun of him when he went to China and he was running over all those Chinese kids [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=90.0s)]
*  on the basketball court. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=93.72s)]
*  He was chasing after the cranes and in that Beijing bobsled like a goofy little kid. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  And I mocked him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  And then he laughed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  And I was like, all right, well, this guy's kind of normal. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  He demanded that you be fired. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=104.08s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=105.64s)]
*  No, he did. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=106.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=107.64s)]
*  He demanded you be fired. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=108.64s)]
*  Did he laugh about that one, too? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=109.64s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=111.0s)]
*  He did, didn't he? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=112.32s)]
*  He called you an idiot. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=113.32s)]
*  He blamed me for Pelosi's husband getting his head knocked. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=119.0s)]
*  Let's get past that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=120.0s)]
*  I take everything back. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=121.0s)]
*  Get back to what you were saying. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=122.0s)]
*  All right, Dana, what is the evidence for his change in stance? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean, I think he obviously is going to try to change, but he is like a reptile, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=129.88s)]
*  And so he's just constantly like a chameleon. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  OK, what do you want me to be this week? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  But he has a Kamala Harris problem. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=141.88s)]
*  All of his positions are well known. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=143.76s)]
*  And this is a guy who tried to he attacked people who were trying to protect women in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=146.0s)]
*  sports. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=150.6s)]
*  He opened civil rights investigations into school boards and districts that passed parental [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=151.6s)]
*  notification laws preventing schools from hiring hiding info from parents about their [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=155.04s)]
*  own kids. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=160.0s)]
*  And maybe he'll disavow that now, too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=161.0s)]
*  But I'm going to go on the record and say I do not believe for as nice a guy as he might [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=163.04s)]
*  be and for as funny he might be and just he might really like him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  I've never had a chance to meet him. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=169.92s)]
*  I'm sure we'll get along great. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=171.12s)]
*  I just do not think he will be the nominee for the Democrats in twenty twenty eight. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  OK, Harold, what message does this send to the voters about the reliability and the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  stability of a progressive candidate clearly for president is not running in California [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=181.44s)]
*  again when if he can change a key policy overnight, I mean, you know, how does that make a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=187.4s)]
*  a solid candidate for president? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=195.72s)]
*  So I differ a little bit with you, Judge, on this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  I think the real test of leadership. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=199.4s)]
*  And by the way, when you had the UNLV head on the came with the new cap and where I [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=201.32s)]
*  come from, we call that a momentum trader. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  So he's coming back. He's coming back to where it's winning. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=205.88s)]
*  I like the fact, Greg, you said when Newsom was going to do this, you thought it would [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=208.12s)]
*  be good. You first said you think would be good. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=211.4s)]
*  You thought it would be good because if he had people on having Charlie Kirk on and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  having that conversation back to your question, Judge, leadership is able to say, you [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  know, I was wrong. And as long as you say he was wrong, let me give a reason. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=220.76s)]
*  No, you're leading the witness. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=226.92s)]
*  Let me finish my answer. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=228.6s)]
*  I'm saying I didn't say this is total. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm saying real leadership says I was wrong about something. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  And here's why. And they give the answer. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  What I was trying to say about education is in any issue that matter what the issues, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  if something is working and you didn't agree with it, we talk about education or [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=240.28s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, we're talking about it all. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  And he's talking about transgender athletes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  He said he would not, which is a switching position for him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=247.72s)]
*  If you're able to say, you know what, after thinking about it, after looking at the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  evidence, after watching it practically happen, I've changed my mind. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  I think that's what people want more in politics. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=256.84s)]
*  We have a president who is your friend and who I consider a friend who's changed his [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=259.8s)]
*  mind on things over the last 20 years. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=263.44s)]
*  You know what he believes in the voters of the country believe he's a better person [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=265.0s)]
*  and politician for it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=268.64s)]
*  If he comes around, if Gavin Newsom comes around on an issue that I agree with, you [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=269.92s)]
*  know what I say? Welcome to the crowd. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  But here's the issue. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=275.52s)]
*  Your friend, Dana Perino, has said that there is no evidence to support the evolution [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=276.92s)]
*  or the change. Greg, give us your opinion. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=281.88s)]
*  Well, here's the deal. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=285.88s)]
*  I think that Gavin Newsom realizes that the party's in trouble and he realizes that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=287.16s)]
*  it's cleaving. You have the Bill Maher Democrat and the Joy Reid Democrat. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  They can no longer coexist, which is why he made this podcast play. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  And it feels like Club Random. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=303.68s)]
*  He is trying to keep the men from completely disowning the party. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, and he can't just say, hey, I'm different. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=312.88s)]
*  He's got to show his evolution on the podcast. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=315.16s)]
*  So he's he's bringing in all these conservatives to show that he's not like a three [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=318.36s)]
*  eye, ten legged freak that you normally assume is a Democrat. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  Part of me about his trans about his trans shift, part of me says, you know, better [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  late than never. Like what Harold's saying, don't argue with someone who is agreeing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=334.36s)]
*  with you. He's finally agreeing with me, except he's still lying. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=338.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=342.04s)]
*  He said that the trans are a group prone to suicide because people don't accept them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=342.8s)]
*  There is absolutely no data on that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=347.64s)]
*  And it's a dangerous fact. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=350.08s)]
*  In fact, the study, the data shows dramatic increases in depression post trans [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  surgery. Why is that not surprising? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, imagine all the attention you get and it turns out before you get the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  transition and it turns out you regret it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=362.96s)]
*  All that attention goes away. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=365.24s)]
*  So you become deeply, deeply depressed. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=367.12s)]
*  Ask a D transition. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  So what what's crazy about this and what's so wrong about what he said is remember [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=371.0s)]
*  the story you were told. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=378.2s)]
*  Doctors pressuring parents into surgery for their kids by asking this one question, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=380.44s)]
*  would you rather have a dead son or a living daughter? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=386.92s)]
*  That was a criminal question, a criminal lie. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=390.64s)]
*  Every doctor who asked that question should be disbarred and perhaps charged with [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=393.48s)]
*  something because that's the same lie that Gavin is pushing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, these kids are really, really depressed. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=401.32000000000005s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=403.6s)]
*  You totally f'ed up their heads with this delusion. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=404.92s)]
*  Anyway, very well said. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  Great. All right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  So the evidence is against you, Harold. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZRVqa3QZvo&t=411.92s)]
