# ‘DITCHING DYES’: RFK Jr. lays out plan to remove some fake dyes from food
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s)
*  R.F.K. Jr. outlining his plan to phase out artificial dyes from the U.S. food supply. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=0.0s)]
*  Don't worry, Jesse, your hair dye's safe. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=5.96s)]
*  For now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=9.26s)]
*  Roll it, Roland. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=10.26s)]
*  We have them on the run now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=12.02s)]
*  And we are going to win this battle. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=14.36s)]
*  And four years from now, we're going to have most of these products off the market or you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=16.38s)]
*  will know about them when you go in the grocery store. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  So, Dana, I don't know how you feel about artificial dyes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=25.18s)]
*  I mean, don't you feel like this is a disadvantage for ugly food? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=30.34s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=34.38s)]
*  How will ugly, I mean, it's like telling a seven or a six that she can't wear makeup. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=35.38s)]
*  No, and then you realize that she's a one. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  It's going to be a long night. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  I understand the idea. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=46.42s)]
*  I understand that Europe has done a lot of this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=48.22s)]
*  Food in Europe is pretty good. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=50.9s)]
*  I haven't noticed a problem. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=52.06s)]
*  Like, I got to go to Spain. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=53.06s)]
*  It was fine. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=54.06s)]
*  I do wonder about European style regulations sometimes and if it's self-inflicted economic [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=55.940000000000005s)]
*  harm and that I also don't know why you have to go to war with companies unless is there [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=60.74s)]
*  a way to like, do we have to be at war with everybody? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=66.06s)]
*  Can we just like maybe cooperate and see if there's a way to get things better? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=68.18s)]
*  But I know that this is very popular with some people. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=72.22s)]
*  Jesse, the RFK Junior believes that these dyes have contributed to behavioral problems. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=74.7s)]
*  If that were the case, wouldn't we be all freaked up like freaks right now? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=81.1s)]
*  I ate so much breakfast cereal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  It was coming out of my ears. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  You stopped eating the breakfast cereal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  You still eat tricks? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=91.94000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'll eat it at midnight. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=92.94000000000001s)]
*  You really? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=93.94000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=94.94000000000001s)]
*  Well, you do other things, but other people don't and they eat like 17 bowls of it and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=95.94000000000001s)]
*  then they eat Flaming Hot Cheetos and then they eat Baja California Mountain Dew. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  And so his point is this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=105.26s)]
*  This is not nanny state. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=107.86000000000001s)]
*  This is just telling people what this stuff is and they have agreed without being sued [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=109.4s)]
*  to remove it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=114.26s)]
*  Now, Trix tried this and they used radishes, purple carrots and turmeric. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=115.26s)]
*  Is that how you say it? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  And no one bought Trix because all the colors were dull. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  So they went back to the food dyes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=125.54s)]
*  So hopefully this works out because it does cause ADHD and it lowers your testosterone [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  if you eat too much of this stuff. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=133.66s)]
*  You think that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=134.66s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=135.66s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=136.66s)]
*  I read it on the internet, Dana. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=137.66s)]
*  Has to be true. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=138.66s)]
*  Judge, would you ever eat ugly food? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=139.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=141.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I've been accused of making it sometimes too. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=143.06s)]
*  Look, here's the thing about RFK. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=145.38s)]
*  This guy fought his family, his party. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=147.73999999999998s)]
*  He's in there doing what he thinks and what I believe is it's long past time for this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=151.1s)]
*  country to do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=156.98s)]
*  Where the FDA and the CDC, nobody really gave a damn. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=157.98s)]
*  You've got Japan, Europe, you've got other countries who banned all of these color dyes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=161.66s)]
*  And in the United States, we're seeing all kinds of suffering as a result of all of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=168.54s)]
*  these poisons and carcinogens. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=173.42s)]
*  And as he said, you want petroleum in your cereal, go ahead and pour it at home yourself. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  But don't put it in my cereal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  I give him incredible credit and the president too. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=182.42s)]
*  I'm all for it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=185.82s)]
*  I'm giving him the ability to do it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=186.82s)]
*  Get the stuff out of the food. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=187.82s)]
*  One more thing up next. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=188.82s)]
*  Sorry, kid. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=189.82s)]
*  We'll get it anywhere else. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7DbKbJbE-s&t=198.54s)]
