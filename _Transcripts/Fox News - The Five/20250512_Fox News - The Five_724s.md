# 'The Five': Trump works his magic on China
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50)
*  Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Kaylee McEnany, Harold Ford, Jr., Jesse Waters, and for her [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=0.0s)]
*  birthday they had a stripper jump out of a cupcake. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=8.6s)]

*  President Trump wheeling and dealing before jetting off to the Middle East, giving a one [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=20.28s)]
*  hour and eight minute presser where he riffed on everything from Big Pharma to getting a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=24.38s)]
*  truce with China by cutting tariff rates for 90 days. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=28.58s)]
*  We achieved a total reset with China after productive talks in Geneva. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=32.94s)]
*  Both sides now agreed to reduce the tariffs imposed after April 2nd to 10 percent for 90 [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  days as negotiators continue in the larger structural issues. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=47.2s)]
*  They've agreed to open China, fully open China. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=50.78s)]
*  And I think it's going to be fantastic for China. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  I think it's going to be fantastic for us and I think it's going to be great for unification [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=57.3s)]
*  and peace. 47 also signing an executive order directing drug makers to lower the prices [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  of their medicines to align with what other countries pay and kindly using his tubby friend [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=67.7s)]
*  to illustrate his point. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=73.02s)]
*  A friend of mine who's a businessman, very, very, very top guy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=74.94s)]
*  Most of you would have heard of him. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=80.66s)]
*  Highly neurotic, brilliant businessman, seriously overweight. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=82.62s)]
*  And he takes the fat, the fat shot drug. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=88.38s)]
*  And he called me up. I'm in London and I just paid for this damn fat drug I take. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=92.78s)]
*  I said, it's not working. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=98.86s)]
*  He said, he said, I just paid eighty eight dollars and in New York, I pay thirteen [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=100.74s)]
*  hundred dollars. What the hell is going on? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=108.9s)]
*  So true. And Trump smacking the liberal media silly for making a stink over the prospect [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=112.42s)]
*  of Qatar gifting him a luxury jumbo jet to use as Air Force One after Boeing failed to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=117.5s)]
*  deliver one on time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=123.1s)]
*  What does it say to people who view that luxury jet as a personal gift to you? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  Why not leave it? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=129.46s)]
*  But your NBC fake news, right? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=130.26s)]
*  Why not? Only ABC. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=131.98s)]
*  Well, a few of you would. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=133.62s)]
*  Let me tell you, you should be embarrassed asking that question. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=135.62s)]
*  They're giving us a free jet when they give you a putt. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=140.1s)]
*  You say thank you very much. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=143.78s)]
*  You pick up your ball and you walk to the next hole. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=145.1s)]
*  I don't understand that sports analogy, Jesse. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  You can explain it to me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=151.38s)]
*  So the market is back up over higher than I think the first of the year, higher than [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=152.66s)]
*  Liberation Day. But we went through this this conflict where the media was pulling out [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=156.54s)]
*  all their hair and Harold was pulling out what's left of his hair. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=161.26s)]
*  Was it worth it? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=165.26s)]
*  What did we get out of this? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=166.26s)]
*  Well, we're about to find out right now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=167.98s)]
*  There's a structural deal in place where we have 30 to 40 percent tariffs still in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=169.54s)]
*  place on key defense sectors and key industries, autos, pharmaceuticals, steel, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=174.1s)]
*  things like that. And that's what this was always about. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=179.62s)]
*  Over the weekend, Greg. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=181.7s)]
*  Yes, I was reading Adam Smith. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=182.78s)]
*  I love him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=184.78s)]
*  The father of capitalism, wealth of nations. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=185.78s)]
*  He said he wasn't a free trader. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  He was a strategic trader. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=191.38s)]
*  He said there's two instances where you want to put tariffs in place. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=193.82s)]
*  When when you want to protect key defense industries, that's what we're doing here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=197.38s)]
*  And two, to keep certain domestic products competitive with foreign products when [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=202.3s)]
*  they're dumped illegally. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=207.22s)]
*  I was actually getting that from Chet. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=209.26s)]
*  Gbt. I figured it was either that or Grok. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=210.82s)]
*  What was I doing, Greg, at 3 a.m. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=213.18s)]
*  on Saturday? I'd hate to find out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  Nothing good. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=217.9s)]
*  I was watching Scott Besson announce this deal, not because it's a great deal, which [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  it is a great deal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=223.74s)]
*  I just don't want to hear this guy talk about tariffs anymore. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=224.7s)]
*  I'm sick of it. He's been wrong this whole time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=228.78s)]
*  Trump says this is the most beautiful word in the world. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=232.14s)]
*  I like deportation, but I like go. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  Besson also said that the other problem that we don't have now, China ignoring [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=239.14s)]
*  the trade laws because they didn't respect Biden. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=245.06s)]
*  So they admitted in Switzerland that they didn't agree to that first phase one Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=248.06s)]
*  deal because Biden never enforced it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=252.86s)]
*  Yeah, he never even tried to enforce it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  So if they're polar opposites, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Trump loves risk and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=256.94s)]
*  he's a dealmaker and he's self-reliant. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=262.42s)]
*  Joe Biden lived off the taxpayers, is afraid of risk. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=265.38s)]
*  And I remember during the first vice presidency, they sent him over to Iraq to cut [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=269.54s)]
*  status of forces. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=273.7s)]
*  He didn't even get that done. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=275.22s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't get Mexico to help with the border. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  All right. He got ripped off with Brittany Greiner. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=278.66s)]
*  Remember that deal? Yes, I do. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=280.94s)]
*  But now we're talking about Joe Biden. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=282.86s)]
*  Sorry, it all goes back to Joe. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=284.66s)]
*  Harold, I know it's only five oh four fifty, but in your face early, because we [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  sat here and argued about that stock market's never going to come back up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=297.74s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's good to be back around the table. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=299.18s)]
*  Happy Mother's Day again belated to everyone. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=300.94s)]
*  What we argued and debated about was whether the three goals that the president laid [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=302.82s)]
*  out from the outset of this, which was three things, I believe one to reassure [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=307.22s)]
*  manufacturing in the United States to to raise tremendous amounts of revenue. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=310.86s)]
*  At one point, President Trump, I believe, said that this could raise upwards of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=315.74s)]
*  five hundred to six hundred billion dollars worth of revenue in a year and over [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=319.54s)]
*  four year period. We can do the math, as he was talking about Doge. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=322.7s)]
*  Four, reduce our reliance on China and supply chains outside of the country. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=326.06s)]
*  Jesse, to your point about Adam Smith, reducing our ability or should say, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  preventing nations from dumping goods in America that would allow our domestic [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=336.5s)]
*  manufacturing to grow and to prosper. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=340.66s)]
*  That is one of the primary reasons, if not the reason you impose tariffs. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  We don't make the things that we are blocking China from bringing in for that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=346.74s)]
*  matter. Other places. I wish we did more of it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  In fact, that's what we have to know. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  But we ought to be prepared. We don't make automobiles. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=355.66s)]
*  We do. But with the parts of our bills come from all across the world, Jesse. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=358.3s)]
*  No, I understand that. That's why we're trying to protect them. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=361.54s)]
*  China can't dump them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=364.1s)]
*  Understand, but we were making you have to be making them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=365.38s)]
*  OK, well, so what about the five trillion investment announcements that have come [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=367.9s)]
*  in for manufacturing? They're great. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=372.06s)]
*  Five trillion dollar investment commitments for high tech manufacturing, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=373.42s)]
*  automobiles, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, defense. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=377.42s)]
*  But Jesse, they're commitments. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=380.54s)]
*  We don't have the workforce. We don't have the factories. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=382.38s)]
*  We don't have the capacity. I love it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  But the truth of the matter, Adam Smith was right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=387.5s)]
*  And you should read it more closely. Finally, as we think about it, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=389.58s)]
*  as we think about it, as we think, and I don't mean to be critical, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=393.26s)]
*  but as we think about it, I think we agree that Adam Smith was right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=395.5s)]
*  We do. And so so much so that we're not even close to what he was talking about. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=398.53999999999996s)]
*  Adam Smith on the show. We should. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=402.53999999999996s)]
*  But but but understand what happened, Greg. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=404.46s)]
*  He he he he blinked on tariffs. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  That's why the markets come back. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  But the challenge is we have punished supply chains. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  We've made it difficult for small and big businesses to forecast [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=413.26s)]
*  how they're going to invest, whom they're going to hire and set prices. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=416.53999999999996s)]
*  I hope I'm wrong. But you know who validates what I'm saying? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=419.5s)]
*  You ought to get Chad GP to ask you what Adam Smith said about setting prices. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  You're smarter than Scott Besson and you're smarter than Lutnick and Donald Trump. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=425.42s)]
*  No, you know, all the people that are cheering the trade deal. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=429.74s)]
*  They're wrong. But they're saying they love the fact that we removed [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=433.06s)]
*  ourselves from a tariff war with China. I'm not saying I'm. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=436.62s)]
*  We're still a war. We have 30 to 40 percent tariffs. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=439.54s)]
*  We have a fentanyl. I'm not saying I'm smarter than Scott Besson. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=441.98s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm smart. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=445.74s)]
*  Any people that I do know one thing, I don't work for Donald Trump. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=446.70000000000005s)]
*  So I can tell you what I believe is a fact. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=449.70000000000005s)]
*  We him today, you do kind of win around the five. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=451.78000000000003s)]
*  And him blinking on tariffs and China [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=456.1s)]
*  blinking on tariffs has helped the market come back and give us some more. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=459.42s)]
*  We're going to have to get you to a room, Kayleigh. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=462.38s)]
*  You're analyzing for two. So go ahead. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=464.98s)]
*  I am. Yes, I am a big one growing. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=466.66s)]
*  Thank you. You know, Harold, there are things that we need to make. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=469.14000000000004s)]
*  And I know this because I was in the White House in 2020. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=471.5s)]
*  And I was there when our strategic national stockpile was depleted. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=474.18s)]
*  And Trump said the cupboards were bare and we didn't have ventilators [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=478.1s)]
*  and we didn't have N95 respirators. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=480.90000000000003s)]
*  He had to go like this and just come up with them to save the country and save lives. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=482.42s)]
*  And Scott Besson, one of the things people missed about what he said at 3am [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=486.18s)]
*  when most of us were sleeping, Greg, maybe you were up. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=489.3s)]
*  You have a baby. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=491.3s)]
*  As he said, I want to reshore critical supplies like during Covid. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  It's a big win for the American people. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=496.22s)]
*  But look, you know, I think the bigger picture here is when I think about [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=498.66s)]
*  the Sunday to Monday turnaround, like I'm watching Jon Hamm last night, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=501.98s)]
*  this new show, you know, friends and neighbors. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=506.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's a little hot for my liking. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=508.58000000000004s)]
*  But nevertheless, I'm not reading Adam Smith like Jesse on my weekend. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=511.1s)]
*  But I'm doing the lazy things most Americans do. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=515.26s)]
*  And then we snap into work and we go to work Monday. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=517.9s)]
*  I was with Dana this morning. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=519.82s)]
*  Trump, however, on Sunday night is doing most favored nation [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=521.22s)]
*  revolution revolutionizing pharmaceuticals just before he announces [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=525.82s)]
*  a freed American hostage, just before he wakes up to a massive China deal. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=529.1s)]
*  This man is reshaping society in the time that it took Joe Biden [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=534.5400000000001s)]
*  to take a nap in a beach chair in Delaware. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=538.5s)]
*  And every day, if you go all the way back to Tuesday with the Houthi announcement [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=541.3s)]
*  and then the ceasefire in India and the UK agreement, every 24 hours, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=545.34s)]
*  there's a major, major win for the American people. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=549.34s)]
*  And it is nothing short of impressive. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=552.02s)]
*  You know, Dana, it always seems to me that the criticism on Trump [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=554.1s)]
*  will always be the same. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=557.3s)]
*  It's not about the results. It's about the process. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=558.82s)]
*  Did we really have to go through all this with deportations or doze? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=561.42s)]
*  Now it's trade. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=565.3s)]
*  It's always going to be about the process. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=566.54s)]
*  Yeah. On the deportations, I think that obviously that that one's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=568.74s)]
*  a good argument to be having. People are like, that's great. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=573.26s)]
*  We started off talking about Wall Street, but initially, like we were all saying, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=576.94s)]
*  who cares about Wall Street? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=580.34s)]
*  And my concern from the beginning has been small and medium sized businesses. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=581.54s)]
*  And across the board, they are like, whoa, what are we doing? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=584.5s)]
*  Because even if it's 30 percent, they got all their stuff out there. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=586.98s)]
*  They had two to three weeks margins. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=589.98s)]
*  They're already laying off people. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=592.14s)]
*  So maybe this puts a halt to that. And I hope that's the case. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=593.74s)]
*  China's got big problems. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=596.1s)]
*  They have the fact that they have a housing crisis. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=597.3000000000001s)]
*  They have an employment crisis now because a lot of factories have laid people off. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=600.98s)]
*  They have a health and energy crisis, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=606.1s)]
*  environmental crisis, I should say. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=608.9000000000001s)]
*  They have more energy than than we do. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=610.1800000000001s)]
*  I think that that's partly because of their regulatory issues. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=612.2600000000001s)]
*  But they're also savers and not consumers. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=615.1s)]
*  And that was the big thing that changed over the past 30 years. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=617.82s)]
*  There was a belief that if you give people the freedom [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=620.3000000000001s)]
*  to make more money, that they would buy things. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=623.5s)]
*  They don't. Why don't they? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=625.14s)]
*  Because they have a terrible social safety net and everyone saves all their money. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=626.0600000000001s)]
*  But then they can't buy anything with it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=629.3000000000001s)]
*  They don't want to buy stuff. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=630.7s)]
*  So there are changes that can be made there. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=631.58s)]
*  The other thing is when you look at, for example, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=633.86s)]
*  I have a lot of time to talk about it, but just on the most favored nation thing, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=637.5s)]
*  the drug thing, I'm old enough to remember Obamacare [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=641.0600000000001s)]
*  and what all Republicans fought against and why there was a tea party in the first place [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=644.22s)]
*  is because we didn't want socialized medicine. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=647.82s)]
*  Now, there are some people even back then who said, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=649.46s)]
*  but actually this drug thing, that could actually work. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=651.58s)]
*  But I would love to see is something I haven't seen anyone talk about be a big deal, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=653.78s)]
*  especially with Europe, if you want the fat friend to pay the same price. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=657.46s)]
*  Well, one of the reasons that you have to remember, you lived in England. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=661.82s)]
*  Do you know how much they pay an income tax to have a terrible health care system? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=664.9s)]
*  It's probably thirteen hundred dollars by the time they add it up. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=668.38s)]
*  That the medicine versus the thing. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=672.02s)]
*  This is what I would love to see. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=673.82s)]
*  I think President Trump should try to make the Europeans [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=674.86s)]
*  take reciprocity with our FDA. Yeah. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=677.98s)]
*  Then you would see great research and development, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=680.74s)]
*  great. Yeah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=683.06s)]
*  And for all the R&D. Right. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=684.26s)]
*  So so instead of making us then go through FDA approval, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=685.9799999999999s)]
*  their equivalent in Europe, you should take our FDA approval. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=690.02s)]
*  What's wrong with our FDA? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=692.66s)]
*  And if we did that, all of us would save so much more money [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=694.18s)]
*  and we would cure more diseases. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=697.0999999999999s)]
*  Such a good point, Dana. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=699.06s)]
*  Put that in your Good Point Journal. Thank you. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=700.38s)]
*  Fat Shot is a great name. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=703.26s)]
*  So great shot. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=706.02s)]
*  All right ahead, Democrats claim they got roughed up after storming [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=708.26s)]
*  an ice facility, but the tape tells another tale. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpScfrK-a50&t=711.3s)]
