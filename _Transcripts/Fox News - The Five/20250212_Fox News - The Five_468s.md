# Jesse Watters: Trump is a true humanitarian
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0)
*  We had a great call and it lasted for a long time, over an hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=0.0s)]
*  I think I can say with great confidence he wants to see it end it also. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=6.68s)]
*  We ultimately expect to meet. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=10.6s)]
*  In fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there and we're going to meet also [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=12.16s)]
*  probably in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=17.68s)]
*  The dealmaker is putting his skills to the test. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=19.88s)]
*  President Trump sounding off on a phone call he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=22.26s)]
*  and start negotiations immediately to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=26.64s)]
*  And that comes as a second American is heading home. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=30.44s)]
*  Amongst three detainees released from Belarus, the identity of the hostage has not been released [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  and we'll bring that to you when we get it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=38.14s)]
*  And it's less than 24 hours after Trump's team secured the release of Mark Fogel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=39.94s)]
*  This was an amazing scene. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  He was an American teacher detained in Russia since 2021. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=46.32s)]
*  And in an emotional moment, Fogel literally kissing the US soil upon his return to the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=49.96s)]
*  good old USA. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=55.16s)]
*  Jesse, he was not returned even though six months before Brittany Greiner, he took medical [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  marijuana into the country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=65.28s)]
*  That was not allowed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=66.84s)]
*  And the Russians were looking for someone to go after on this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=68.32s)]
*  They knew he was going to be on the plane. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=71.56s)]
*  They knew he was likely going to have this medical marijuana because he had taught at [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=73.08s)]
*  this school for a long time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=76.24s)]
*  That was six months before Brittany Greiner. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=78.17999999999999s)]
*  When she came home, the administration as we went and looked back, we're like, oh, yeah, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=80.14s)]
*  we don't have any more details on that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=84.44s)]
*  Refer you to the State Department. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=85.72s)]
*  Yes. So they both had grass and she came home and he didn't. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=86.92s)]
*  And everybody knows why. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=91.08s)]
*  And Biden thought that would help him politically. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=93.36s)]
*  And it didn't at all. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=95.84s)]
*  And so Trump is, despite what people say about him, a true humanitarian. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=97.84s)]
*  He places such a priority on human life. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=103.44s)]
*  You got the Gaza hostages, you got the Russian hostages, you got the Venezuelan hostages [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=107.4s)]
*  almost immediately. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=112.08s)]
*  And remember what we did with Otto Warmburg. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  It's also the Maha movement. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=117.48s)]
*  It's also fighting fentanyl. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  All of these things are about cherishing and saving human lives. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=123.68s)]
*  And he doesn't get a lot of credit for that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=128.24s)]
*  And he's not going to get enough credit for ending the Ukraine war. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=130.44s)]
*  He's not going to get enough credit for hopefully resolving things in the Middle East. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=133.28s)]
*  But if you look back on both terms at the end of the second one, he will be probably [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  viewed as one of the more humanitarian minded presidents we've had. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=142.32s)]
*  One of the things, Judge, that was really lovely about this story is that Fogel's mother, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  she's in her 90s, mid 90s, met with President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, just minutes [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=151.4s)]
*  before President Trump was shot. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=155.88s)]
*  And in that meeting, she said, if you win, will you bring my son home? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=157.64s)]
*  And he said, yes, I will. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=161.88s)]
*  And so she's in her mid 90s and time is of the essence. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=163.4s)]
*  And they were finally able to be reunited. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=167.6s)]
*  She said he promised, or her daughter said, I believe it was on Fox today, President [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=169.92s)]
*  Trump promised my mother that he would bring my brother back. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  And I was listening to that and I was saying, well, that's who President Trump is. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  He is, as you said, Jesse, a humanitarian. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  He is caring. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=187.6s)]
*  But this whole thing, Dane, is infuriating to me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  Because I say to myself, 21 days, this man is president. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=192.88s)]
*  We've got six prisoners from Venezuela. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=198.56s)]
*  We've got countries taking back prisoners that Biden said, oh, they won't take them [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=201.16s)]
*  back. I don't know what to do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=205.28s)]
*  And we've got the war is going to end in Ukraine and Russia. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=207.04s)]
*  I mean, now, you know, Putin is throwing in these prisoners. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, the exchange for Mark Fogel, you know, it was a crypto hacker. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  The exchange for Brittany Greiner was an arms dealer, terrorist related charges. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=220.6s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, the whole thing is just so bizarre. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=226.68s)]
*  But it's infuriating that Joe Biden didn't even do wellness checks on American [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=230.16s)]
*  prisoners and hostages. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=235.24s)]
*  And Donald Trump comes in in 21 days and he's killing it because he cares. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=237.12s)]
*  And when you think about it, that's why Joe Biden got elected. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=243.04s)]
*  Everyone said he was the compassionate guy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=245.8s)]
*  He didn't give a damn. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  Didn't put any effort into it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=249.28s)]
*  And now we're seeing what a real president and a real caring man will do. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=251.28s)]
*  What do you think about the comparison? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=255.4s)]
*  And Harold, because it is impossible to look at this and say, President Trump's been in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  office for not quite four weeks. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=261.44s)]
*  And all of these things have happened, especially the things that matter the most. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=263.8s)]
*  Right. Our people are being held wrongfully and we should get them back. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=266.44s)]
*  And this is pretty remarkable. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=272.24s)]
*  It is. Any time an American comes home from being held hostage in a communist nation, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  or for that matter, any hostile territory, I just celebrate it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think even looking at the equivalency of who might have been traded for whom. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=284.8s)]
*  I mean, I'm glad I'm glad he's home. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=291.0s)]
*  I would remind you that the Crypto Act was a money launderer, too. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=292.92s)]
*  But I'm not complaining. I'm glad this guy's home. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  I share your view. I don't know why he didn't get home sooner. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  Was there politics involved yesterday or may have been? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=301.96s)]
*  But I'm one that just sits back and says whenever an American comes home, congratulations. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=304.88s)]
*  Mr. Fogle also gave a lot of credit to Steve Woodcock, who apparently I knew a little about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=310.64s)]
*  before I learned about him publicly here, a little bit as business ventures. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=315.96s)]
*  This guy's become a pretty good diplomat and reminds me of many ways of someone I hold in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  high regard, the late Bill Richardson, who I served with in Congress, who was able to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=325.44s)]
*  get hostages released. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=328.84s)]
*  But to listen to Mr. Fogle last night, praise the president and Mr. Woodcock. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=329.76s)]
*  I give them both congratulations on getting Mr. Fogle home. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=333.36s)]
*  The Biden team also left Ridge Alconis in prison in Japan for months after even when [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=336.28s)]
*  that's our greatest ally as the young man from the State Department. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  Like to remind me, and I will never forget that phone call ever. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=346.32s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I know that. That's why I'm saying what President Trump is getting these [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=350.24s)]
*  guys back from our adversaries. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=354.76s)]
*  But Biden wasn't even able to get them back from our allies. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, he's not a non-binary woman of color. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=359.76000000000005s)]
*  Don't you know any better, Dana? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=364.6s)]
*  By the way, to piggyback on what the judge said, it seems so easy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  And a lot of these things seem way easier than we were told. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=372.88000000000005s)]
*  It's like when you compare the Biden administration to the Trump administration, it's like when [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=376.8s)]
*  I leave work and I'm pushing the door to leave and I can't get out and then the security [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  guy goes, yeah, just have to pull it open. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, and it feels like that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=387.4s)]
*  All Trump's doing is, oh, you just have to pull the door open. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=388.6s)]
*  Joe, you've been pushing the door. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=391.44s)]
*  Pull it open. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=393.76s)]
*  I think the legacy news needs help with this story. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=395.12s)]
*  Go on CNN's homepage. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=397.76s)]
*  Go on MSNBC's homepage. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=399.52s)]
*  This story isn't anywhere. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=401.68s)]
*  There was a great story on a book called I Hate Myself with Joe Scarborough holding [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=403.48s)]
*  it up, which is amazing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsgBTjFIt-0&t=408.52s)]
