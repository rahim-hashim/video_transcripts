# ‘The Five’ reveal what Dems hope will sink Trump
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0)
*  A lot of these Democrats seem to think that Trump's style is going to sink him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=0.0s)]
*  Where have they been? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=3.68s)]
*  The Dems and the media spent his first term with their hair on fire over his tweets. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=5.36s)]
*  Four years later, their solution is they let their hair grow out again and set it on fire [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=12.36s)]
*  again and it's not working. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=17.22s)]
*  Trump gives them so much and all they do is cry, no, no, no, make it stop, make the mean [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=19.68s)]
*  man stop. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=25.8s)]
*  Look, you had four years of hibernation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=26.8s)]
*  You didn't have to do squats. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=28.92s)]
*  You get nothing from us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=31.32s)]
*  It's funny now you have to do your job and nobody cares. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  It's like there's nothing the media can do. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=35.08s)]
*  Nobody trusts you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=37.900000000000006s)]
*  You're like the background, you're like the sound of an air conditioner in a room. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  We just got used to the hum. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  We don't even know you're there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=43.22s)]
*  You know what the funny thing is? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=44.44s)]
*  The Dems don't understand Trumpers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=45.88s)]
*  That Trumpers understand that Trump is a package deal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  You know, we know what we're getting with Trump and it's an all-inclusive package. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=53.24s)]
*  Maybe there's some things you could do without it, but you can't do Trump a la carte. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=57.68s)]
*  There's just no way to do it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=61.56s)]
*  I used to think that Trump's were he won in spite of Trump's tweets. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=63.4s)]
*  I think now he won because of it because the outbursts and his kind of tone and attitude [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=67.64s)]
*  tells you everything's in working order. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=74.56s)]
*  It's like, you know, if you have a Shelby Mustang in the driveway, you hear the engine, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=77.08s)]
*  it's loud, it's scary, but it's working. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=81.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Democrats car is in the garage, it's up on blocks and it's sputtering every [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=84.08s)]
*  time you turn the key. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=88.52s)]
*  Well, and after Biden, you know, radical transparency, Jesse, might be exactly what the doctor ordered [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  for the country and maybe for the Democrats. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=95.36s)]
*  Well, first of all, Greg just called Jessica an air conditioner and it was probably the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=98.08s)]
*  nicest thing he ever said about her. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=102.96s)]
*  A white noise machine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=104.56s)]
*  Hey, if you don't have air conditioning though, you would be upset. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=107.56s)]
*  Yeah, but you know who wanted to ban it? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=110.8s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=112.84s)]
*  And that's why my hair looks flat today because it's a slow flow shower. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=123.08s)]
*  So Trump was like a presidential shock jock. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=124.08s)]
*  And for 10 years, they're still shocked. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=127.4s)]
*  They're not shocked anymore. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=130.08s)]
*  Everyone got over it right away. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=131.52s)]
*  It was only shocking because he was saying things that no other politician had ever said. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=133.22s)]
*  Everybody in their private lives said the same things and thought the same things. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=138.68s)]
*  And that's why he loved them because he said the same things we all felt in our heart. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=142.62s)]
*  Now, if you're pretending to still be shocked now, while at the same time trying to act [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=147.1s)]
*  like him, trying to say we need our own Trump and Adam Schiff sounds like this Democrat [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=152.74s)]
*  dirty Harry over my dead body. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=157.06s)]
*  Get the f out of here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=159.5s)]
*  And how do we talk like men? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=160.5s)]
*  And then every time a real man talks, they're like, oh my God, I can't hear this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=162.94s)]
*  You guys got to pick a lane and figure it out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=166.62s)]
*  Now, the Joe Biden stuff. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm just remembering these conversations I had with the air conditioner and we would [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=169.9s)]
*  say stuff like, where's he been for six days? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=174.58s)]
*  And you'd be like, well, he just had a cabinet meeting. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=177.74s)]
*  We'd be like, but it was staged, Jessica. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=179.74s)]
*  Oh, well, he just did a sit down interview. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it was with Dylan. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=183.78s)]
*  These are the kind of things we were going through and Tapper saw it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=185.58s)]
*  Tapper saw him almost fall asleep with Al Roker. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=189.02s)]
*  He almost like, what was that? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=192.34s)]
*  An interview that he skipped for the Super Bowl, which is a layup. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=194.62s)]
*  So now they're acting like, oh, we didn't see anything. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=198.62s)]
*  He skipped the Super Bowl interview. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=200.46s)]
*  That's when you knew. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=202.9s)]
*  That's when you knew it was all over. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=203.9s)]
*  They were in on hiding Biden and he slept with Al Roker. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=205.3s)]
*  He slept with Al Roker. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=208.78s)]
*  Not that there's anything wrong with that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=210.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  It's intense. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  Rosanna, you know this, you work in media. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  We live in a content world and you can make content. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=217.94s)]
*  You can react to content, but you can't stand still. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=222.82s)]
*  But the Democrats have been standing still and just hoping that Trump falls. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=227.52s)]
*  They hope that he was going to go to jail. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=230.78s)]
*  They hope that he was going to lose the election. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=232.34s)]
*  They just hope that he will go away. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=235.02s)]
*  Now they're hoping that people will just get tired of him because of his style. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  And meanwhile, the Democrats' popularity continues to go down while Trump's is, you [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=239.68s)]
*  know, it's down relative to where it was, Jessica, I agree. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=244.36s)]
*  But it's still better than where they are. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, the Democrats used to have their finger on the pulse. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  But let's face it, six months later after the election and they're still trying to figure [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=252.96s)]
*  out what went wrong. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=257.12s)]
*  So they go to this highfalutin hotel and they sit down and they try to figure out what they [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=258.76s)]
*  did wrong, what their new message is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  And then everybody finds out they went to, you know, a very expensive hotel. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=267.12s)]
*  And are they tone deaf? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=271.14s)]
*  Are they not listening to the American people? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=272.7s)]
*  The Democrats were a party of lunch pail voters, labor unions. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=275.12s)]
*  They had their finger on the pulse, championing labor, fair wages, social issues. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=279.82s)]
*  They've gone so far from their original cause. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=286.0s)]
*  I think that they're looking to find a messenger. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=288.92s)]
*  And right now, I don't think they have one in mind. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=294.6s)]
*  It seems every few weeks they have somebody new. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=297.08s)]
*  Let me open up to Jessica then. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=300.0s)]
*  Do you think they have a messenger now that is effective? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=301.2s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=304.68s)]
*  I think Bernie Sanders and AOC are very effective messengers. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=306.92s)]
*  So do we. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=310.16s)]
*  But that's not about who's going to lead the ticket. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=311.16s)]
*  That's what like a Rahm Emanuel is saying that the party needs. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=314.16s)]
*  I enjoy listening to Rahm Emanuel and hearing from him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=316.88000000000005s)]
*  And I'm glad that he's all over the media circuit as well. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  But there is something compelling in the energy that AOC and Bernie are bringing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=323.24s)]
*  And you see that in the reaction of people in one of these rallies who say this isn't [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  even my politics. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=330.68s)]
*  You think that Iowa is full of people, Idaho is full of people. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=331.68s)]
*  So they like the energy but the policies are terrible? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=335.0s)]
*  It's not about policy right now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=336.82000000000005s)]
*  The election is 18 months away for the midterms even, not even the presidency. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=338.72s)]
*  People are desperate to see the Democrats have a pulse. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=343.54s)]
*  They like Chris Murphy right now, who has a completely moderate set of policies. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=345.58000000000004s)]
*  He has, if you watch him, he's creating content constantly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=349.74s)]
*  He's right now walking across the state of Connecticut talking to voters. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=352.38s)]
*  He has a moderate. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=356.14000000000004s)]
*  Who's Chris Murphy? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=357.14000000000004s)]
*  He's terrible. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=358.14000000000004s)]
*  Is that a joke? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I know, but I mean, seriously. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=360.14000000000004s)]
*  The one who said that he didn't have daughters so he couldn't talk about transgender sports. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=361.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, he's a coward. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  He grew a beard too. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=365.34000000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  What's that about? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  He's not a man. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  He's not a man. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  I think that's biologically incorrect. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  I think he's trans. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=373.02s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=374.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=375.02s)]
*  Trans men or men or trans men women? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=376.02s)]
*  Not sure. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=378.7s)]
*  Well, we'll figure it out in the C block, which is about trans women. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=379.7s)]
*  What does C stand for? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=381.7s)]
*  What? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=382.7s)]
*  It stands for up next. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=383.7s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=386.7s)]
*  There is an important distinction to be drawn between being accessible and being good or [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=389.05999999999995s)]
*  or actually saying what's going on in the world. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=398.44s)]
*  And now I'm all fuddled up in my head. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=402.88s)]
*  But you've been told Bibi Netanyahu to cut it out. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=404.48s)]
*  We don't call him Bibi. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=407.0s)]
*  I always get that name wrong. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=408.0s)]
*  Well, don't. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=409.4s)]
*  It's important. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=410.4s)]
*  There is Donald Trump does this thing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=411.4s)]
*  Not only like today, he says, you know, we got 5.1 trillion in the Middle East. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  There's actually it was 1.5 trillion like a week ago. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=417.6s)]
*  But most importantly, he sits down for these interviews. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=420.08s)]
*  And I think Biden should have been more accessible. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=422.2s)]
*  Maybe we would have had a competitive primary if he had been more accessible. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=423.84s)]
*  But he does these interviews and then he says, I don't know or I'm not sure. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  Like Kristen Welker asked him, do you need to uphold the Constitution? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=431.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=434.20000000000005s)]
*  Ask a lawyer. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  Are you sending migrants to Libya? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=436.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=437.48s)]
*  Ask Homeland Security. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=438.48s)]
*  You just announced a new nominee for surgeon general who didn't graduate from med school. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=439.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  Bobby likes her. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't know her. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  You have the power to bring back a Briego Garcia. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't make that decision. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=448.32000000000005s)]
*  Lawyers do. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  You are arguing on behalf of him right now. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=452.44000000000005s)]
*  I'm saying that that is what the criticism is of him. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=453.44000000000005s)]
*  He may be in front of you, but that doesn't mean that he's not spewing utter BS. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=456.42s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=460.7s)]
*  I've got to say. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=461.7s)]
*  What do you have to say? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=462.7s)]
*  I have to say that the hardest thing that you're dealing with and I think is that nobody [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=463.7s)]
*  respects the media enough to give them an answer after what they did to the American [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=467.78s)]
*  people for four plus years. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=472.62s)]
*  They covered up. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=474.9s)]
*  So it's like, it's like, let's stop talking about Jake Tapper. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=475.9s)]
*  No, I never stopped talking. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=478.42s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_Tg76g-o0&t=481.42s)]
