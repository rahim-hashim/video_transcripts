# 'The Five' breaks down spat between Trump and Maine governor
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI)
*  You in court, President Trump just laid the smackdown on Maine's Governor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=0.0s)]
*  Janet Mills, and right to her face for defying his executive order, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=3.74s)]
*  preventing trans athletes from competing in girls and women's sports. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=8.3s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=12.06s)]
*  I understand Maine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=15.5s)]
*  Is Maine here, the governor of Maine? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=17.42s)]
*  Are you not going to comply with it? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=21.1s)]
*  Well, I'm, we are the federal law. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=25.62s)]
*  Well, you better do it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=28.02s)]
*  You better do it because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=28.98s)]
*  And by the way, your population, even though it's somewhat liberal, although I did very well there, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=32.260000000000005s)]
*  your population doesn't want men playing in women's sports. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=37.02s)]
*  So you better, you better comply because otherwise you're not getting any, any federal funding. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  Every state. Good. I'll see you in court. I look forward to that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  That should be a real easy one. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=49.06s)]
*  And enjoy your life after governor, because I don't think you'll be in elected politics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=52.22s)]
*  Just hours after that dust up at the governor's meeting, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=55.92s)]
*  the department of education announcing a new title nine investigation into Maine over the boys and girls and sports issue. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=60.16s)]
*  It could result in Maine losing 250 million an annual federal funding judge. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=66.8s)]
*  It's funny, you know, you go to a nice luncheon with a bunch of other governors and then bam, right in the face. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=73.24s)]
*  Well, you know, it shouldn't have been a surprise because when Joe Biden left office, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=79.16s)]
*  he tried to change Title nine and he tried to add the transgender identity as being a basis for discrimination. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=83.06s)]
*  And so a federal judge has since vacated that and the president has issued an executive order. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  And this should not be a surprise to any Democrat because the country in incredible numbers, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=98.14s)]
*  I don't know what the stats are, but the country is against men in women's sports. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  Everybody knows that a transgender is at a physical advantage over girls. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=109.76s)]
*  Okay. If you're if you're playing in the girls sport sports. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=115.84s)]
*  So president saying you're going to jeopardize 250 million dollars in federal funding and she's going to say, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  well, I'm following following federal law and state law. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=125.48s)]
*  Who cares what the state law said? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=127.92s)]
*  The federal law has supremacy on this issue. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=129.4s)]
*  Federal money. Okay. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=131.68s)]
*  And she's going to lose. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=133.28s)]
*  And it's stupid of her as far as I'm concerned to say, well, you know, with the federal law supports us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=134.74s)]
*  No, you're stupid. It doesn't. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=140.02s)]
*  Jessica, Maine's a poor state losing 250 million dollars over something like this just seems dumb. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=142.38s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see how it plays out. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=148.38s)]
*  I took it that Governor Mills was also talking about the anti-discrimination laws that exist and that she'll have to abide by them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  And we'll see. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=156.1s)]
*  That was my expectation that then this would happen immediately and there would be funding on the table and it'll play out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=157.22s)]
*  But the problem with some of these executive orders as it pertains to gender is that gender is a lot more complicated than they would have you believe. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=164.06s)]
*  Like one of Trump's lawyers was in court with this federal judge, Judge Reyes, and said, you know, there is men and there's women. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=173.16s)]
*  It's just about male and female. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=181.52s)]
*  And the judge said that's actually biologically incorrect that there are 30 examples of people, types of intersex people. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  So not everyone is. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=190.36s)]
*  Well, what does that mean? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=191.7s)]
*  It's not intersex. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=192.22s)]
*  Well, you say it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=193.94s)]
*  You have both. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=194.58s)]
*  You have both? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=195.98s)]
*  It's such a rare exception. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=198.22s)]
*  It doesn't even. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=199.98s)]
*  That's exactly the point. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=200.98s)]
*  It's just like the transgender is trying to compete. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=202.82s)]
*  There's like 1%. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=206.22s)]
*  I'm not denying that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=207.5s)]
*  So why force girls across this country to have to be in a bathroom? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=208.74s)]
*  So just admit it's illegal, it's wrong and the public doesn't want it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=213.18s)]
*  Well, that's not what you would be admitting by saying like illegal doesn't mean. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=215.82s)]
*  For 200,000 years have been men and women. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=219.94s)]
*  Now we got three, four, 20. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=222.2s)]
*  No, 30. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=224.4s)]
*  You have to consider 30 types. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=224.9s)]
*  The point is that you can't just make a generalized sweeping law that would exclude people who do exist. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=227.52s)]
*  You have to make sure that there's some place for them in this conversation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=233.72s)]
*  I'm not asking about trans women. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=237.92s)]
*  I have never said that I thought that transgender women should play in women's sports. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=240.72s)]
*  I'm saying that some of these executive orders on gender are more complicated than the administration thinks. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=244.28s)]
*  And then they show up in court and they don't even know about intersex people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=249.36s)]
*  Let's spit some of the other genders in here, Greg. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=252.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, the idea of gender being fluid and not male, female was a sweeping decision made by many politicians without any science. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  But first I want to talk about that amazing moment with the governors. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=266.04s)]
*  With the Trump presidency, every morning is like the day after Halloween. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  I wake up and have a big bag of candy waiting for me. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  And I have to slow down because I'm going to throw up before breakfast. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=276.96s)]
*  I can't stop. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=280.76s)]
*  I mean, I love this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=281.92s)]
*  And also what that does is it forces the discussion beyond the I hate to use the phrase again, load bearing phrase transphobics. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  Generally, what would happen is you would go like, I don't I don't like to have I don't men saying that their women should not be in women's sports. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, well, that's transphobic. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=298.68s)]
*  And then everybody go, oh, better shut shut down. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=300.08s)]
*  Now you go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=303.2s)]
*  You have to explain to me why you have to tell me why that that should be allowed. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=305.44s)]
*  Then you can get into the argument. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=311.32s)]
*  Well, there's this point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero percent who are intersectional. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=312.56s)]
*  He goes, well, that's great. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=319.48s)]
*  I would call that the tyranny of the minority, that you would change all these rules for point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero of the population. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=320.36s)]
*  This is something the left does all the time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  What about this exception? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=329.52s)]
*  What about that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  The main governor is a typical example of this old female progressive who puts men who say they're women above actual women. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=331.44s)]
*  Their compassion is gained. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=340.56s)]
*  They're terrified of not being virtuous. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=342.6s)]
*  It's weird that when I compare myself to her, I'm the feminist. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm the I'm arguing on behalf of authentic safe spaces for women, safe spaces that she would willingly sacrifice because she doesn't want to appear as [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=350.48s)]
*  in her in her world transphobic. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=361.2s)]
*  She's a coward. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  She's an absolute coward. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  I love every minute of it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=365.92s)]
*  And Greg doesn't want to be a feminist. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=367.88s)]
*  You're forcing him to be a feminist. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=370.24s)]
*  That is against his will. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=372.24s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=374.24s)]
*  You could join Trudeau. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  He's the ultimate feminist in his own words. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=376.36s)]
*  Self declared. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=378.32s)]
*  Look, the left may find gender complicated, but the American people do not. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=379.36s)]
*  A Washington Post poll from 2023 found 34 percent think that biological men should be in women's sports. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=383.6s)]
*  Thirty four percent. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=389.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=390.04s)]
*  OK, so that's twenty twenty three. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=390.56s)]
*  Well, fast forward to Trump, his executive order on this. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=391.8s)]
*  Sixty three percent approved, according to Marquette. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  So why is the left choosing to die on the hill of a 70 30 issue? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=397.76s)]
*  Go read the New York Times undecided voters. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=402.44s)]
*  I'm just going to quote one two sentences. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=404.64s)]
*  I shocked myself when I voted for Trump. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=406.64s)]
*  No one tell my family. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=409.36s)]
*  I think I became radicalized was the word she used on the issue of men and women's sports. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=410.88s)]
*  That ad said Kamala represents they them. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=416.04s)]
*  Trump represents you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  That was so compelling. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=419.92s)]
*  So die on the hill of this issue. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=421.48s)]
*  Janet Mills, you walked into a brunch you weren't expected to be called out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gq38vuL-jI&t=423.12s)]
