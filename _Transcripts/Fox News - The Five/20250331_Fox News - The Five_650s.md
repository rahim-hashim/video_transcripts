# Dems need a 'sober intervention': Gutfeld
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q)
*  The Democrat Civil War is getting uglier by the day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Party members are firing shots at each other, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=3.4s)]
*  pointing fingers over who is to blame [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=6.2s)]
*  for steering them straight into the woke ditch. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=8.5s)]
*  Greasy Gavin Newsom is trying to distance himself [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=11.6s)]
*  by calling his own party toxic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=14.8s)]
*  We talk down to people, we talk past people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=18.6s)]
*  These guys are crushing us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=20.8s)]
*  The Democratic brand is toxic right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  The Democratic party brand is really problematic. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=24.6s)]
*  With all respect to my colleague from California, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=27.8s)]
*  is associated with New York and with California, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=31.0s)]
*  is associated with the educated elites in this country [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=34.4s)]
*  and not anymore with working people in this country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=39.4s)]
*  Is the Democratic party brand toxic right now? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=42.6s)]
*  Well, I think that this is not a new thing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  because people have policies that haven't worked for them. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=51.3s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=55.0s)]
*  But Bill Maher wasn't going to let Gavin Newsom [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=56.2s)]
*  sweep years of woke governance under the rug. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=59.2s)]
*  Democrats tend to be a little more judgmental than we should be. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=63.2s)]
*  This notion of cancel culture, you've been living it, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=67.0s)]
*  you've been on the receiving end of it for years and years and years. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=70.0s)]
*  That's real. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=72.2s)]
*  And Democrats need to own up to that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=73.2s)]
*  They've got to mature about this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=74.8s)]
*  So what do you say to people who say, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=76.4s)]
*  well, this sounds all very good, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=77.8s)]
*  but Governor, you were the poster boy for a lot of this stuff. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=79.8s)]
*  And John Fetterman is once again reminding his fellow Democrats, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=84.0s)]
*  quote, if we don't get our bleep together, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=87.4s)]
*  then we're going to be in a permanent minority. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=91.2s)]
*  Now, you know what I think is interesting about this, Katie, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=94.2s)]
*  is the fact that you've got Gavin Newsom saying, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=99.4s)]
*  you know, we talked down, we're toxic, we're this, we're that, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=103.2s)]
*  but he never really identifies what it was that he was wrong about. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=106.8s)]
*  It's this generic, we're wrong, but never identifying about what. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=111.4s)]
*  So if something is a certain way, the question is, well, why is it that way? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  And Democrats and their brand is toxic, which is good, he can admit that, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  because of their policy positions and their hard-fisted enforcement [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  into people's lives on a regular basis and the rejection of common sense [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=128.4s)]
*  and thinking that they know better than parents, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=133.6s)]
*  than individuals to make decisions for themselves. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=136.4s)]
*  So when it comes to actually talking about different kinds of policies [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=139.2s)]
*  Democrats could pursue, someone like Gavin Newsom doesn't want to do it, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=143.2s)]
*  because he stuck his neck out a little bit a couple weeks ago [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=146.6s)]
*  and said that boys shouldn't be in girl sports, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=149.2s)]
*  and all of a sudden now the far left of the party is calling for his head [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=151.6s)]
*  and not wanting to put him on the ticket for 2028. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=155.0s)]
*  And so they have to decide if they're going to let the far left of the party [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=158.2s)]
*  hold them hostage. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=161.6s)]
*  You've seen even the New York Times saying that the country shifted to the right, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=162.8s)]
*  and yet still the Democrats are trying to pull to the left. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=166.6s)]
*  There is this interesting populism that does transfer into [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  MAGA and Bernie Sanders AOC type crowd, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=173.9s)]
*  and fundamentally Democrats are better still at elections, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=177.5s)]
*  things on our movement on the ground, for example, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=181.4s)]
*  the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, special elections, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=184.0s)]
*  but overall, nationally, the Democratic brand is toxic [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=187.1s)]
*  because of what they believe in and what their policies are, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=191.2s)]
*  and if they're in this situation where they can't even talk about what they are, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=194.1s)]
*  they're never going to be able to win those elections nationally. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  So Greg, what does it come down to? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=200.9s)]
*  I mean, the fact that they're not willing to identify what it is [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=202.6s)]
*  that makes them toxic, I mean, is it about toxicity or is it about stupidity? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=206.5s)]
*  I want to go back to the Wisconsin race. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=212.6s)]
*  No, actually, because like we can talk about this toxicity stuff, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  but, you know, they still win local races, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=218.4s)]
*  but Gavin calling his party toxic is like Adam Levine saying Maroon 5 sucks. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=221.9s)]
*  We agree, but you're the lead singer. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=227.3s)]
*  I think that, I think, and this is a piece of advice to Jessica, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=229.8s)]
*  I think the Democratic Party is letting America down [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  by not confronting the extremism head on that's destroying the party from within. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, we talked about the public attacks in the A block, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=244.5s)]
*  but, you know, the Jews on campus, the trans delusions stuff, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=247.6s)]
*  but at a larger scale, you're going to let America down [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  by not becoming a healthy, positive opposition party. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=257.4s)]
*  I love that the right's in power, and I hope they're in power for a very long time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=261.9s)]
*  I think this correction was long needed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=266.0s)]
*  It could have been, the pendulum wouldn't have had to swung so much [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=269.3s)]
*  if the Democrats weren't so crazy, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=272.9s)]
*  but if the Dems no longer pull their own weight and sink, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=275.2s)]
*  it's going to make it easier for Republicans to swing that pendulum [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=278.9s)]
*  even farther and farther in the opposite direction, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  but that's not our fault, that's on the Democrats' fart. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=285.4s)]
*  The Democrats shrunk the size and scope of their influence [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=289.5s)]
*  by amplifying these, you know, these activist cults [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=293.3s)]
*  and these edge fantasies, it's diminished your relevance. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  So, you have to stop championing these extreme views [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=301.0s)]
*  in order to be taken seriously, but you have another obstacle, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=305.1s)]
*  and that is the Biden cover-up that destroyed your party's reputation [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=309.0s)]
*  and the credibility of the legacy media that backed you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  So, how do you come back from that? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=317.1s)]
*  I do think you guys need like a sober intervention where you go like, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=319.0s)]
*  okay, who are we? What are we? What are we? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=322.3s)]
*  Imagine you live in a world where Trump doesn't exist, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  so you can't just say we're against that, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=329.8s)]
*  but you have all these issues that Trump fronts that you might even like, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  like, what do you do? That's who you are. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=337.6s)]
*  You cannot rely on defining yourself against a person. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  So, Jesse, what is the answer to the question? What do they do? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=345.6s)]
*  And, you know, you've got them all saying we're toxic, we're toxic, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=349.8s)]
*  we're toxic, but so what? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=352.7s)]
*  Well, it's a good question, and Greg's right, the Democrats, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=356.2s)]
*  Jessica's the best thing they have going. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=359.5s)]
*  Well, Harold, too. Don't forget Harold. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=361.3s)]
*  That's assumed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  But I would say to Greg, they should become more tolerant [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  because it's like when I go out with friends and we're at a restaurant [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=370.6s)]
*  and we see some freaky-looking transgender person sashay by [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=373.6s)]
*  with the pink hair and the nipple rings and da-da-da-da-da. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=378.2s)]
*  We don't need the details. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  It's part of the story. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=383.3s)]
*  We don't gay bash them. We don't even say anything. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  We might just go... [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=389.0s)]
*  We just let it go. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=392.3s)]
*  And if they don't tolerate us, why are we tolerating them? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=394.2s)]
*  I mean, you saw what happened with the police they get screamed at. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=398.4s)]
*  During BLM, girls were just trying to have brunch [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=401.9s)]
*  and they were getting heckled on the side of the street. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=404.2s)]
*  And so you guys were annoying already and then COVID hits [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=407.3s)]
*  and you become super snobs, like absolute power, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=411.6s)]
*  and it looks like you're trying to hurt us. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=416.0s)]
*  That's how it felt. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=418.5s)]
*  You thought we were dirty, dangerous and dumb [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=419.8s)]
*  and you tried to just separate yourselves from the rest of society. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=422.4s)]
*  And then you just lost respect for the country. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=426.0s)]
*  I remember it was like last Easter. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=428.1s)]
*  Biden was celebrating Transgender Day on Easter weekend. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=430.0s)]
*  You know, like stuff like that, like the Columbus statue. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=434.1s)]
*  You didn't even protect it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=437.0s)]
*  So people think like you really hate our country. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=438.3s)]
*  And then they just became rude. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=441.3s)]
*  Honestly think it's about manners. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=443.1s)]
*  You just have to be tolerant of other people. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=444.7s)]
*  And then it's like you just became uninteresting. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=447.8s)]
*  Like we don't want to even be around you guys [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=450.7s)]
*  because it didn't feel like you were interested in us. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=452.90000000000003s)]
*  Like you didn't care that these migrants were coming in to take our jobs [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=455.3s)]
*  or no one could afford any food anymore or crime was up. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  So like why should we care about you if you're not going to care about us? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=462.2s)]
*  This is going to take a long time for them to recover. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=465.3s)]
*  We should never forget what you did. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=467.7s)]
*  And I will remind the audience every day. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=472.7s)]
*  Okay, so Jessica, the head of the DNC, this guy Ken Martin, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=475.0s)]
*  he says that we've got the right message. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  We just need to connect it with the voters. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=484.5s)]
*  It doesn't seem like he's changing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=486.9s)]
*  It's going to take a little while to... [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=490.5s)]
*  So Jesse was right. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=492.5s)]
*  No, he was not right about a whole host of things [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=494.29999999999995s)]
*  and him accusing us of being the ones who don't listen [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=498.09999999999997s)]
*  where I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know what gender my children are. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=501.0s)]
*  Well, he doesn't want to... [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=505.1s)]
*  You have girls. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=506.3s)]
*  Two. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=507.4s)]
*  I'm holding two fingers. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=508.6s)]
*  So you were wrong, Jessica. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=510.6s)]
*  It was really close. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=512.7s)]
*  He was like... [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=514.9s)]
*  It's a rebirth moment and this is normal after a party loses. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=519.1s)]
*  I would say though that if you look at the scoreboard from November, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=523.4s)]
*  we held on to a lot of really close races in swing states, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=527.9s)]
*  these Senate seats and Trump, yeah, it was great. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=532.1999999999999s)]
*  He won all seven, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=534.5s)]
*  but there were races that the Republicans should have been able to win that they didn't. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  People like Ruben Gallego overperformed when even ahead of Kamala Harris holding Nevada, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  Wisconsin and Michigan by a slim majority. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=544.0s)]
*  We'll see tomorrow. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=546.8s)]
*  There's a special election in a Florida plus 30 seat. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=547.5s)]
*  If you look at just the early vote, Democrats are doing super well as usual, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=551.5s)]
*  out raising, etc. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=555.0s)]
*  But basically what everyone has said is the content of this pretty bold editorial from the New York Times [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=556.3s)]
*  that came out yesterday where they said Democrats are in denial about 2024 and they had three main points. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=564.0s)]
*  Greg hit on two of them. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=569.8s)]
*  Number one, that they mishandled Biden's age and that that is something that has to be dealt with [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=571.8s)]
*  and there have been a number of important figures in the party that have said this is going to be an issue for 2028 [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=576.5s)]
*  and that you can't run away from it anymore. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=582.0s)]
*  You have to actually talk about what happened. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=583.9s)]
*  Number two, that the party has shifted too far from the left to the left from 2017. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=585.9s)]
*  So Hillary Clinton was a very moderate candidate and then something changed. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=590.3s)]
*  And then number three has to offer new ideas. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=594.6s)]
*  And that's the point about a message with even if it's ideas that are catchy, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, like no tax on tips and things like that people they can kind of sink their teeth into and say, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=603.3s)]
*  okay, this is something that the party stands for. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=607.6999999999999s)]
*  Don't you think that they really have to do the 80 20 issues and come out and say, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=610.0s)]
*  Everyone basically had that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=614.5s)]
*  I mean, listen, when you say that people are outraged about Gavin Newsom, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=616.6s)]
*  you know, saying that or having Steve Bannon, it's not really true. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  That's all like fluff online. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=622.5s)]
*  Like everyone agrees with it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=624.6999999999999s)]
*  Everyone is happy that he's having these conversations. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=626.6s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=629.6s)]
*  The 80 20 issues if they don't address them, they're in trouble. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=631.4s)]
*  But up next more bad hombres just booked an extended stay at El Salvador's mega prison. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=634.0s)]
*  To catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=644.4s)]
*  You won't get it anywhere else. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP0NzAM2Q&t=648.5s)]
