# Judge Jeanine has advice for liberals who keep calling Trump a dictator
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk)
*  They often say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=0.0s)]
*  but expecting different results. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  And that sums up the Democratic Party after Kamala ran a whole campaign likening her opponent [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=5.84s)]
*  to Hitler and getting absolutely steamrolled. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=10.8s)]
*  Defeated liberals are once again screaming about an impending fascist coup and a dictatorship [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  under President Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=20.16s)]
*  You're not going to like what I'm saying next. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=21.16s)]
*  We are in the middle of a totalitarian fascist coup in this country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=23.84s)]
*  If we were being honest, there should be a breaking news banner on CNN and MSNBC all [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=28.0s)]
*  day long. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=33.68s)]
*  We are in dictatorship right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=34.68s)]
*  The things that I'm speaking out about now about the threat to our democracy, the prices [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=36.4s)]
*  at the grocery store are going up because democracy is being taken away. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=41.4s)]
*  And legendary Hollywood director James Cameron is also coming down with a bad case of TDS [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=48.72s)]
*  and like one of his movies, looks like he's unable to escape the Trumpinator. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=53.72s)]
*  I think it's horrific. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=59.4s)]
*  I think it's horrifying. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=60.4s)]
*  And you know, we could talk about this all day long, but you know, I see a turn away [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=63.84s)]
*  from everything, everything decent. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, America doesn't stand for anything if it doesn't stand for what it has historically [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=71.48s)]
*  stood for. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=76.84s)]
*  You know, it becomes a hollow idea. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=77.84s)]
*  And I think they're hollowing it out as fast as they can for their own benefit. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=80.44s)]
*  So Jessica, we're doing the dictatorship thing again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=84.6s)]
*  I guess so. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=88.52s)]
*  How did it work last time? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=89.52s)]
*  Not great. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=91.44s)]
*  I think that you can not to be a broken record from just five minutes ago. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=94.56s)]
*  I think you can talk about the specifics of what's going on without using the kind of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=98.44s)]
*  terminology that turned off a lot of people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=101.68s)]
*  So the base desperately wants people to go on offense. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=103.96s)]
*  And I get that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=108.28s)]
*  It's something from 65 to 70 percent want people in positions of power to go harder. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=109.28s)]
*  I forget the exact term that they used in the survey for it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=115.08s)]
*  But I think that you can set the stage by just saying Donald Trump doesn't respect the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=118.44s)]
*  way the government works. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=125.88s)]
*  He wants to override Congress. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=127.28s)]
*  Congress appropriates the money. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump thinks you do what you want. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=130.44s)]
*  He doesn't respect the judiciary. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=132.12s)]
*  They threaten judges who make decisions that they don't agree with. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=134.04s)]
*  He doesn't believe in a free press. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=137.86s)]
*  Not only what's going on with the AP, but changing the way the press pool works. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=140.58s)]
*  You changed the press pool. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=143.82000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=146.10000000000002s)]
*  Go check out what Jackie Heinrich has put, our own Jackie Heinrich. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=147.10000000000002s)]
*  No, our very own. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=150.74s)]
*  I'm sorry, Jackie. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=151.74s)]
*  That's not going to work on us. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=152.74s)]
*  We don't, we think for ourselves. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=154.58s)]
*  I love Jackie, but I disagree with her. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=157.02s)]
*  There you go. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=158.82000000000002s)]
*  End of story. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=159.82000000000002s)]
*  No, it's not the end of the story. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=160.82000000000002s)]
*  It is just the beginning. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=161.82000000000002s)]
*  That's my line. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=162.82000000000002s)]
*  Is it in your notes? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  It's the beginning. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=167.5s)]
*  Anyway, I'm done. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=168.5s)]
*  Good. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=169.5s)]
*  All right, can I go? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=170.5s)]
*  Good. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=171.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=172.5s)]
*  Article two of the Constitution. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=173.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=174.5s)]
*  The president has the obligation to ensure that the laws of the land are followed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=175.5s)]
*  And when Congress appropriates money or when money is misappropriated, the president in [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=180.38s)]
*  the executive branch has the authority to look at that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  So let's not make like he doesn't have the right to do it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=188.16s)]
*  By the way, the first amendment, John Roberts just came down and said, you better watch [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=190.54s)]
*  it, folks. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=196.02s)]
*  The local judge who made one of those decisions to hold to issue a TRO just got slapped down. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=197.54000000000002s)]
*  So let's not make this greater than it is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=203.18s)]
*  The bottom line is the Democrats are going nowhere. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  And I love it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  They should keep it up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=210.9s)]
*  Their message is a message of hate. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=211.9s)]
*  Everything's about hate and Pritzker, he shouldn't be talking about food prices. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  He should be talking about food in his own situation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=217.66000000000003s)]
*  But when he says the prices of the grocery store are going up because democracy is being [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  taken away. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=224.66000000000003s)]
*  Who is he kidding? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=225.74s)]
*  They couldn't talk about inflation or price. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=227.46s)]
*  Take a look at him for four years. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  And now he wants to talk about democracy, taking it away. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  And James Cameron, he's living in New Zealand. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=234.94s)]
*  Stay there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  He's been there for 20 years. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  He made his money off Americans. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  If he's so worried about America, why don't you move here? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  A lot of this is a process complaint. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=245.02s)]
*  You know, it's about the press pool. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=247.26000000000002s)]
*  It's about this judge or Congress. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=249.26000000000002s)]
*  Do voters really care that much about process? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=252.02s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  And that's another reason why they're not getting any traction and why Doge continues [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=256.54s)]
*  to have the kind of reaction that it does. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  Look, aside from the polling, and I agree, there's not a ton, but the one polling that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=262.58s)]
*  we have says Americans like it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=267.58s)]
*  Look at the ratings. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=269.7s)]
*  Why do you think we talk about Doge every day? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=271.7s)]
*  Because people want to hear about it, they want to know about it, and they are interested [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=273.9s)]
*  in what's going on. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=277.14s)]
*  The other thing is when they use, when the left uses language like we are living under [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  a totalitarian regime, I think about all the repressed people around the world. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=282.22s)]
*  Do they get a word? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=287.1s)]
*  What about aren't those the people that they're so concerned about with the foreign aid problem? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=288.1s)]
*  And that's on the merits. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  But when you use language like Hitler, totalitarianism, that we're taking away democracy, and that's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  causing egg prices to go up, you sound so stupid that it's impossible. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=301.86s)]
*  It's like, why even argue with them? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=306.02000000000004s)]
*  They're so they're not. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=307.54s)]
*  It's not even worth arguing with. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=309.06s)]
*  This doesn't merit our time, except for to make fun of them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=310.42s)]
*  So we just make fun of Jessica now? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=315.0s)]
*  We don't argue with her? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=316.5s)]
*  Oh, Pritzker. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=317.5s)]
*  Pritzker. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=318.5s)]
*  Got it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=319.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=320.5s)]
*  Do we have that picture of Pritzker again? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=321.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=322.5s)]
*  Let's put it up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=323.5s)]
*  You know what? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=324.5s)]
*  He looks like he ate Chris Christie. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=325.5s)]
*  So mean. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=329.06s)]
*  No, you haven't seen Chris Christie at all. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=331.06s)]
*  I'm not saying that Pritzker is a cannibal, but I'm not not saying it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=335.02000000000004s)]
*  I know it's funny you said we watch it to make fun of it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=339.38s)]
*  I think that CNN has created a new media specialty, Jennings porn. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  It is like porn. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=347.73999999999995s)]
*  It lasts about three minutes and you just keep watching it over and over again. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  And I feel bad for the bookers at CNN because they have to like they have to look at the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=351.78s)]
*  guests that they feed to the slaughterhouse to Jennings. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  They look like a model UN, like a collection of high school debaters who have no idea they're [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=363.48s)]
*  on a TV show. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  They bookers know Scott Jennings isn't on. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  You're safe. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=373.72s)]
*  Got Jennings isn't on. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=374.72s)]
*  And they sit down. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=375.72s)]
*  It's like when you watch somebody when you watch Jennings ask Tarray or whatever his [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=376.72s)]
*  name is, this goes to your point. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=380.72s)]
*  His reason behind his banal assertions, his eyes are like as wide as saucers because nobody [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=383.12s)]
*  asks a follow up question. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=389.48s)]
*  Jessica's right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=392.92s)]
*  You got to come armed with specifics because one day someone's going to ask you for why [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=394.0s)]
*  do you think that James Cameron, why do you think it's been terrifying? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=399.66s)]
*  What makes you feel that way? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=406.48s)]
*  How is it terrifying? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=409.2s)]
*  Why are you like it's like you got to get beyond these load bearing phrases of fascism [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=411.0s)]
*  and Hillary's. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=417.86s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=419.06s)]
*  I mean, I swear you could probably watch the ratings on CNN. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=420.06s)]
*  They're like this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  And then when Jennings is on it goes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  That's why I don't do podcasts. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=430.46000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=432.02000000000004s)]
*  Because I'm terrified of the follow up question. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=433.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=434.5s)]
*  You know what? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=435.5s)]
*  I will just melt down. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=436.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=437.5s)]
*  You think I've thought about this before? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=438.5s)]

*  He's like a no. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=456.82s)]
*  Like he's just been around pretending to be like an expert. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=457.82s)]
*  It makes you think that CNN is having a very hard time finding people to go on the show [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=459.74s)]
*  opposite Jennings. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=463.98s)]
*  Jennings porn. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=466.38s)]
*  I'm sure Gavin Newsom is going to be like, oh, let me at him. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=467.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=470.62s)]
*  Jennings versus Newsom would be good. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcaY7QH_Qk&t=471.62s)]
