# 'The Five' unpack AOC’s red district offensive strategy
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA)
*  The days of hiding their candidate in a basement or knocking back a beer with liberal suckups like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=0.0s)]
*  Stephen Colbert might be over for Democrats as they eyeball a more aggressive strategy to win [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=5.12s)]
*  voters. Tim Walz, the woke guy Kamala tapped to only face plant in the election, is claiming [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=10.88s)]
*  Democrats didn't take enough risks and that his party, quote, shouldn't have been playing things [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=17.44s)]
*  so safe. AOC is taking that message to heart by planning to make appearances in Republican [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=23.36s)]
*  held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York. Listen, if your representative is not [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  doing a town hall, give me a ring. I mean, I don't know if an R plus 25 district would have me, but [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=36.4s)]
*  I'm always willing to be proven wrong. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=46.0s)]
*  OK, but how is this helping? The so-called moderate Democrat senator from Michigan, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=51.04s)]
*  Alyssa Slotkin, went on The View earlier to claim that Trump voters are having a temper tantrum. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=55.68s)]
*  We're about to turn 250 years old, right? We're still pretty young for a country. These are our [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=62.24s)]
*  like our angry teenage years. And what do you do when you have a teenager who's threatening [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=68.08s)]
*  themselves and others? You just try to get them through this period alive so that their brain can [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=72.8s)]
*  fully form. OK, Jesse, she's she's talking about America, you know, not having developed its [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=78.16s)]
*  prefrontal lobe sufficiently enough to be able to elect a good president in her mind. Where's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  this woman coming from? I don't know where the lobe is. I don't know where she's coming from, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=94.4s)]
*  but it was pretty clear why we voted for Trump. Anybody that looked at the last four years knows [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=98.72s)]
*  Joe Biden was not equipped to be president. Now, AOC is interesting because she has to get [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=105.36s)]
*  attention. She can't go on MSNBC and CNN to get attention because no one's watching. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=111.36s)]
*  So she has to try to break into where the audience is, which is here or anywhere on the right. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=117.52s)]
*  But I don't really have a lot of high expectations because I saw her not do so well with NPR. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  That seemed challenging, although she does have potential. I like how she tries to root out [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=129.2s)]
*  corruption. I like how she doesn't want stock trading in Congress, but she has no street cred [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=135.92s)]
*  with the working class after the Amazon deal, the open borders deal and the defund the police deal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=141.44s)]
*  What I want to see her do is really hug her district. Queens is a powerhouse and she's AWOL [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=147.6s)]
*  there. We sent Johnny, no one even heard of her there. So if she would just kind of say, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=153.76s)]
*  this is my district, this is who I want this district to be and focus on education, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=157.92s)]
*  public safety, wages. Those are the kind of things that you can really grab onto and be a leader. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=163.44s)]
*  So right now she just doesn't have it yet. And you know, Dana, AOC has said she's going to now [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=173.44s)]
*  go into Republican districts and town halls to talk to the voters. She says, quote, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  I want an honest conversation. Is this the AOC we all know? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=184.32s)]
*  Well, all those things that Jesse just mentioned, those would be great goals. I would love to see [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=187.92s)]
*  a Democrat take on the teachers union as we were talking about education. It's just abysmal, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=192.64s)]
*  the situation. But she's also the one who ran Amazon out of town from her own districts. All [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=196.48s)]
*  those issues that you mentioned are not ones that will help her earn those small dollar [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  donations, which is how a lot of them make a ton of money. Now, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=206.48s)]
*  going into red districts, I admire her spunk. I like her attitude. She's like, let's go, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=210.96s)]
*  let's throw down. Maybe she should start a podcast. She probably has one. But I would say this, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=215.04s)]
*  she should probably go into blue cities first. They're at a 31% approval rating. So before they [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=220.32s)]
*  can start taking on the Republicans, they have to figure out their own situation. And I don't know [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=225.04s)]
*  if she's going to be a part of that. On Alyssa Slotkin, if I could just mention this, I think [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=231.04s)]
*  she is a really impressive person. And even though she broke my rule, my rule, don't ever say yes to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=235.92s)]
*  doing the response, but she handled it okay. Right. It was like not a collapse, not a disaster, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  but she made another mistake. Don't go on the view. I wouldn't if she's serious about wanting to have [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=248.48s)]
*  an elevated position, and she wants to be more of a statesman, don't go to the places where they're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  just going to basically drag you down with them or drag you further to the left, figure out a way [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=259.28s)]
*  to go around the traditional media so you can make a bigger mark. You know, what's interesting, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=263.76s)]
*  Jessica, is that you've got AOC and Bernie Sanders. She said she's going to join him as she goes out on [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=269.2s)]
*  the trail. What are they doing? Is there a marriage there of some sort? Well, politically, yeah. And [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=275.52s)]
*  it's gone on for years. One of the more successful ones. I mean, Bernie Sanders, I think people on [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=281.84s)]
*  the right and the left would have to agree has been one of the most authentic communicators, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  certainly, that our side has ever had. And he has huge crowds that are showing up in liberal places [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=291.2s)]
*  but also conservative places to hear him talk about what's going on in the country. He has an [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=296.56s)]
*  economic and economically populist message, the same as Trump did in 2016. Remember, they were the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=302.32s)]
*  two sides of the horseshoe. A lot of people arguing that they think Bernie could have won. Now, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=307.84s)]
*  he doesn't do as well with minority voters, so I don't think that that could have happened, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=312.96s)]
*  but there's a reason that she wants to go out there and do this. And as Democrats search for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=317.36s)]
*  people to be leaders of the party and also a cohesive message, Bernie has the most authentic [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=323.76s)]
*  one that's out there. And I applaud AOC for doing it. And I would just add to Dana's point about the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=328.72s)]
*  view. What she could do is show up in those places and give the answer that maybe they won't like, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  and just say, actually, this is the way you do it. This is how I won my super competitive race [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  in Michigan, right where I got Republican voters and right-leaning independents to vote for me. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=345.68s)]
*  Then she'd have to lie. No, it's not lying. You have a response. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=352.08s)]
*  If only she just acts this way. No, that's- [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=355.68s)]
*  That's what a Democrat does. No, but it's true. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  I was just going to ask you what you think. Well, here's the deal. You guys missed the point. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  Why is AOC wanting to go into Republican rich areas? She's looking for a real man. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=364.88s)]
*  Let's be honest. She's tired of dating a beta cuck. She's looking for a pickup driving dude [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  who works with his hands, knows how to make a woman happy. I'm telling you, it's like a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=376.32s)]
*  romantic comedy waiting to happen. Also, curious how you can have this fabled honest conversation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=383.12s)]
*  liberals always talk about when each conversation is terminated with those load-bearing phrases [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=390.64s)]
*  like racism, xenophobia, transphobia, sexist. How can you have a conversation? Let's say you [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=395.84s)]
*  go to a Republican area and you talk about their resistance to trans in sports. Where does that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  conversation lead? Do you immediately say what you always say? That's transphobic because that's not [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=409.12s)]
*  where the conversation ends. That's where it starts. It's not transphobic. It's common sense. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=414.64s)]
*  Can she have that? The problem for the Dems is that whether it's border, DEI, or crime, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=421.76s)]
*  the social justice lingo begins and ends with racist, racist, racist, racist. So they end up, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=427.84s)]
*  they're like the lonely guy in an apartment hearing a great party going on above them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=433.44s)]
*  And they're going like, how come I'm not invited? It's because you drove everybody away. These [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=438.56s)]
*  people have always been around you, but every time they try to talk to you, you call them names [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=443.84s)]
*  because they don't adhere to your insane ideas. And now you wonder where they all went. Well, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=448.24s)]
*  they went somewhere else where they were wanted. And now you're thinking maybe you should go join [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=452.64s)]
*  them. Well, you're invited, but you better be on your best behavior and wear something really nice. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArPE-i7yiA&t=456.88s)]
