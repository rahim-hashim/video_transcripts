# ‘The Five’: Does the media have to apologize for this?
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs)
*  All right, Dana, I heard you react to that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=0.0s)]
*  A couple of, yeah, I'll go, sorry. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=3.04s)]
*  Well you know what the question is. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=5.24s)]
*  I mean, there you've got Jen Psaki saying, well, they expect us to not like Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=6.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, and yeah, but we know that she, a lifelong Democrat, worked for Obama. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=10.44s)]
*  And that's how I first met her in the Bush to Obama transition. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=15.44s)]
*  That's when we became friends. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  And then she worked for Biden. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=21.54s)]
*  And like, we all get all that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  One thing that's interesting is that when anybody goes against type, it is interesting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=24.8s)]
*  and it can really help. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  I was reminded of this one time at the briefing room, we were under the gun when I was press [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=32.6s)]
*  secretary, President Bush's numbers were bad. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=37.52s)]
*  And a reporter says, well, what are you going to do because your numbers are so bad? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=40.16s)]
*  And I said, well, there's only two entities in this town who have worse numbers than us, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=45.84s)]
*  Congress and you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=51.28s)]
*  And that was back then. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=53.42s)]
*  So then fast forward, and I would just look at the last four years. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=54.82s)]
*  I think that the Biden acuity coverup, that is terrible. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=57.14s)]
*  And now all these books are being written about it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  The fact that the White House said, oh, Joe Biden is running circles around us at the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=64.18s)]
*  White House. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=69.34s)]
*  We knew that wasn't true. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=70.34s)]
*  They would say that inflation wasn't a problem. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=71.34s)]
*  They said it was transitory. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=74.7s)]
*  That wasn't true. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  They said that the border was closed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=77.16s)]
*  It wasn't true. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=79.08s)]
*  I mean, there's all of these things. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=80.08s)]
*  Plus, then you add all the democracy is going to die as soon as President Trump gets into [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=81.22s)]
*  office. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=85.58s)]
*  See, that's not true. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=86.58s)]
*  So I think that adds to it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=87.62s)]
*  Plus, there's a lot of different ways to get your media now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=89.58s)]
*  And I'm glad to be here at Fox News where you can get all of it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=92.44s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=96.58s)]
*  Well, you know, Harold, when Rainn Wilson, he kind of claps back and he says, you know, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=97.58s)]
*  they really were closed minded as it relates to the previous administration. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=103.02s)]
*  And, you know, they see no evil. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  And then he says a lack of insight and passion last time, but here it's different. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=110.34s)]
*  But not you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=117.84s)]
*  He takes it back. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=119.26s)]
*  He's like criticizing the left wing media, but at the same time saying to Stephanie Ruhl, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=120.26s)]
*  but I don't mean you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=124.62s)]
*  What's that about? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=126.78s)]
*  He's being kind. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=127.78s)]
*  And Stephanie, probably maybe maybe he meant that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=128.78s)]
*  I think a couple of things. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=130.34s)]
*  We shouldn't kid ourselves. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=131.82s)]
*  We live in a society where people have so many options to access information, to confirm [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=132.82s)]
*  information that they may read about or hear about. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  But we also live in a time, interestingly and ironically, that more people flock to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  the news, the voices, the insights, the visuals that reinforce what it is they think is right [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=147.84s)]
*  or reinforce what it is they think is the appropriate way to go about trying to solve [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=154.74s)]
*  problems. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=158.42s)]
*  We've had conversations about this before and talking about it and accessing it or [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=160.1s)]
*  entering in a little different way. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=163.5s)]
*  I'm a believer that you should have to sit with people you disagree with. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=165.42s)]
*  I do a lot. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=168.66s)]
*  I think you should have to not only sit with them, but listen. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=169.66s)]
*  Well, you get paid to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=172.18s)]
*  Well, then there's that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  But at the same time, I love my outside of here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=174.7s)]
*  I sit with people all the time I disagree with, and I try my hardest not only to understand, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=177.98s)]
*  but to figure out how we can get to higher ground and solve problems. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=182.29999999999998s)]
*  The left is going to have to understand that Donald Trump won twice, and the country elected [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=185.3s)]
*  him because they believed in a lot of the things that he wanted to do. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=191.86s)]
*  Instead of trying to tear him down and call him names, let's try to build up what it [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=195.06s)]
*  is we want to do, which is why I continually and try to steadily focus on an agenda, why [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=198.58s)]
*  I steadily try to focus on the positive, why I steadily try to focus on ways in which we [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=203.54000000000002s)]
*  can help people get a better education for their kids, take home more pay, be more optimistic [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=207.94s)]
*  about the future. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=213.66000000000003s)]
*  I think that's what I interpreted from Rainn Wilson saying the Stephanie rule, and I hope [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=214.82s)]
*  that Stephanie listened, and I hope that Democrats left, and for that matter, Republicans listened [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=218.1s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, Greg, when Rainn Wilson said 40 percent of the public doesn't trust the media, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=223.45999999999998s)]
*  it's really 60 percent he had the stat wrong. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=228.42s)]
*  But the truth is no one trusts the media, but no one knows who to believe anymore. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=231.38s)]
*  So does the media have to apologize, or what do they have to do to be believed? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=236.94s)]
*  I think it's healthy not to believe the media anymore. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=240.94s)]
*  That's exactly where you should start. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=244.86s)]
*  I'm going to convert the Hollywood liberal in 90 seconds. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=246.66s)]
*  So what you saw there with Rainn Wilson is the evolution from an actor to a fully realized [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=251.18s)]
*  human being. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  So every actor begins as a blank slate, and they embrace liberal beliefs because everybody [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=257.94s)]
*  around them in their industry embraces it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=263.46s)]
*  So they adopt the same beliefs, unaware that they just simply took on another role because [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=266.1s)]
*  they're an actor. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=270.94s)]
*  They don't realize it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=271.94s)]
*  And you think this is what you do. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=273.54s)]
*  What happens is if you're lucky, like Rainn or, say, Zachary Levi or Vince Vaughn, you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=274.98s)]
*  suddenly realize this is a role. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=279.9s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=282.94s)]
*  And that revelation then allows you to think for yourself and allows somebody like Rainn [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=283.94s)]
*  to go on there and go, wait, hold on a minute, because most actors wouldn't do that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=288.62s)]
*  We've all met performers, and we've seen the difference between one that embraces dogma [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=292.9s)]
*  and one that doesn't. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=298.22s)]
*  And the outlier, as we know, whether they are libertarian, right-wing, far left, they're [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=299.22s)]
*  always smarter, more curious, more knowledgeable, and they're free. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=305.02000000000004s)]
*  So there's like this three-step process. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=310.06s)]
*  Blank slate, embrace the liberal theology, realize it's fake, and then you become free. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  Maybe it's four steps. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=318.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=319.06s)]
*  This is what happened to me at Cal. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=320.06s)]
*  I realized that my leftism was a role to fulfill my ego. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  I thought it was fake. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=326.14000000000004s)]
*  To finalize this thing, to the liberal in entertainment, ask yourself, is it a role [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  or is it you? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=332.46s)]
*  If you realize it's a role, then that'll allow you to discover the real you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=333.84s)]
*  Would you like to wrap it up, Jesse? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=339.06s)]
*  Well, I am loving liberals going on other liberals' podcasts because this has never [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=340.26s)]
*  happened before. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=344.9s)]
*  And what you're seeing when you saw Liz Warren be interviewed by that other liberal, and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=346.02s)]
*  the liberal was like, well, you're a liar. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=350.18s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden is basically dead. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=352.74s)]
*  And then you had Walls talk with Newsom. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=355.78s)]
*  Newsom was like, we should kind of learn about these people, these Republicans. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=358.02s)]
*  Walls was like, we can't be friends with these animals. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=362.09999999999997s)]
*  And then today, Rainn Wilson, he's like, no, you're not you, Stephanie, but your industry [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  is horrible. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  And so we saw it during, I think it was the Chicago convention. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=373.14s)]
*  When you walk around and you see these anchors and these senators, they walk around like [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=377.29999999999995s)]
*  ghosts. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  No one recognized them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=383.32s)]
*  This place was packed with Democrats. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=385.34s)]
*  When we were in Milwaukee at the convention, we needed security. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=387.98s)]
*  Greg didn't need anybody. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=392.14s)]
*  No one could see him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=393.14s)]
*  But everybody here needed security because we have such a deep connection to our audience [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=394.14s)]
*  and to the American people. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=400.42s)]
*  You need security for other reasons. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=401.42s)]
*  What would those reasons be, Greg? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=402.42s)]
*  You need a blanket. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=404.62s)]
*  And so when I go into a city, I always talk to the driver, find out what's cooking, what [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=405.7s)]
*  buildings that how the team's doing. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=410.38s)]
*  Or I talk to the bellman or the bartender. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=413.9s)]
*  That's the best. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=416.74s)]
*  Or I talk to Johnny and Johnny tells me what other people are saying. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=418.02s)]
*  So I would suggest rule and the rest of this class of people get their own Johnny. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=421.54s)]
*  It's going to help is what you're saying. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=426.18s)]
*  But it's going to help them. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=427.78s)]
*  Them going on each other's pockets and being challenged. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=429.9s)]
*  Finally, that will help. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=432.26s)]
*  It's healthy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=434.26s)]
*  It really is. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=435.26s)]
*  And fascinating. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwuVodbwycs&t=436.26s)]
