# 'UNBEARABLE': Perino torches Dems' for 'fake' sit-in
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI)
*  The anti-Trump resistance is back with more stupid stunts and god-awful singing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Spartacus himself, Cory Booker, holding a 12-hour sit-in at the Capitol, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  joined by Hakeem Jeffries and the whole clown car of Democrats [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=10.64s)]
*  as they raged against the Republicans' proposed budget. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=14.8s)]
*  I miss Obama. I miss Obama and I miss her husband, too. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=19.36s)]
*  We didn't know how long we would be out here and now we have passed our sixth hour. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  All of you. And we're not going anywhere. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=30.16s)]
*  Not going anywhere. I'm feeling strong. How are you feeling? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=33.04s)]
*  Feeling strong. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=34.8s)]
*  What Grant said is there are but two parties in America right now. Patriots and traitors. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=35.44s)]
*  And if we build this world from love, yadda-dai, yadda-dai, yadda-dai, yadda-dai. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=44.8s)]
*  And when you got nothing else, the Democrats are playing with impeachment fire again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  Chuck Schumer couldn't give a straight answer to this one. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=59.36s)]
*  Two years is too far away to predict. Our job is day to day to day [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=63.04s)]
*  to show who Trump is, what he is doing, and it's having an effect as you're rolling out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=67.36s)]
*  American people are realizing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=72.08s)]
*  You're not saying no. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=73.76s)]
*  Look, it's too far away to even judge. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=75.2s)]
*  All right, Jesse. They've tried everything. Singing, cursing, choose your fighter. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=81.76s)]
*  Trump is so rolled over these people that they really, they just don't know what to do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=87.27999999999999s)]
*  I don't think they know what a sit-in is. A sit-in is when you virtuously, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=93.36s)]
*  peacefully obstruct a public space and you risk a beating. You risk arrest. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=98.55999999999999s)]
*  The civil rights sit-ins where it segregated lunch counters or department stores, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=104.96s)]
*  they're just sitting on some steps. They're not stopping anybody from going to work. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=110.72s)]
*  This is like you could like go to brunch and call it a sit-in. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=116.96s)]
*  I mean, you could sit for a few hours and have a mimosa and call that a sit-in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=120.96s)]
*  Usually, sit-ins are for people out of power who can't change the law, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  not for people in power whose job it is to literally change the law. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  That's what Jesse Jr. was doing in the airport. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=136.16s)]
*  This would be like LeBron James staging a sit-in at the Laker game because he didn't like the offense. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=137.92s)]
*  Well, you could score, get up, and score. That's what these Democrats should do. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, Hakeem Jeffries, Dana, along with Chuck Schumer, I mean, they have no real power. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=153.04s)]
*  It just appears that all they have is political theater and talk. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  They are the out party. I think when you're the out party, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=162.56s)]
*  that means you've got to get out of Washington. This wasn't so much a sit-in. It's a sit-out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  They're sitting outside on a beautiful day. They didn't know it's Saturday. Saturday, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=170.16s)]
*  the rain would have been a real damper on their parade. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=172.96s)]
*  So it's a fake sit-in where they sit around and talk to each other. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  And what you want out of a stunt like this is some sort of messaging that goes, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  well, that was interesting. The only thing they got is viral moments that we're making fun of, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  like the singing again. The other thing is, it would have been really interesting to see a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  civil rights sit-in for the people of Chicago when they lost their public schools to violence [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=192.8s)]
*  and to the migrant shelters. Or what about a sit-in for victims of Lake and Riley, maybe, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=198.0s)]
*  or Rachel Moran? How about a sit-in for them? The other thing that was pretty unbearable for me is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=204.64s)]
*  that two of the primary guests of this fake sit-in were teachers' union people, Randy Weingarten and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=209.76s)]
*  Becky Pringle. And if you want an example of where there's a civil rights violation, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=218.0s)]
*  to me, most of the children in America failing to be able to read and write, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=224.96s)]
*  while these people get more wealthy, these people pretend like there's no problems across America. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  They are the ones that kept the schools closed where you lose a generation of children. And [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  they're the ones that were there because they fund this kind of thing. Maybe this works for [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=242.32s)]
*  their little small group, but they didn't do anything but talk amongst themselves at their [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=246.08s)]
*  fake sit-in. Good point. But you know, Harold, Federman and Ro Khanna, I mean, they're not a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=252.0s)]
*  part of this. And yet the Democrats want us to think, oh, we're united. We're all united against [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=258.48s)]
*  Trump when Federman and Khanna want to work with them. So I think it's important to work with the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=262.96s)]
*  president whatever party you're in when you think the president's right. And if you're not going to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=268.48s)]
*  work with them, offer ideas. What's obvious from this exercise here also is that Democrats are [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=272.72s)]
*  still trying to find their way forward and they're still coming up short. I've tried to say on the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=277.76s)]
*  program that when you are wanting to help and empower and lift people up, offer ideas in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  body that you work. I'm disappointed that the Congress is not asserting itself and the Republicans [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=290.48s)]
*  are in the majority and they are really being muted. Democrats, what you should be doing is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  offering legislation that said that the first 50,000 of income for any American is tax-free. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=299.36s)]
*  The first 50,000 of Social Security taxes that small businesses that have less than 50 employees [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=305.2s)]
*  is tax-free. You should be saying we want to build affordable housing for the working poor. We want to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=310.88s)]
*  eliminate tariffs for home building. We want to eliminate tariffs for medicines. We want to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=315.84s)]
*  eliminate tariffs for chips. So Canada and some from Asia won't have tariffs on them. I don't [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  understand what it is that we're trying to accomplish with the singing. I don't understand [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=325.2s)]
*  what it is we're trying to accomplish. Jesse is right. For Jesse Waters, who's my pal, but listen [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=329.76s)]
*  for him to have the right lecture on a sit-in for Democrats is a tall, tall order. Frankly, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=334.24s)]
*  it's saying to Democrats we're not using not only these tactics, but we have very little substance [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=341.76s)]
*  as we're trying to find our way back. Dana said it. Why not say we're going to give $5,000 [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  vouchers to parents in school districts where their kids aren't learning to help them with [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  tutoring and after-school programs? Why not talk about health care for everyday Americans who can't [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=355.6s)]
*  afford it? Offer these bills and make Republicans and Democrats vote on it. And again, I'll say it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=360.48s)]
*  When Jesse Waters is telling you how to do a sit-in the right way, you should know you're not doing [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=365.6s)]
*  it the right way. Go ahead, Greg. You want to wrap it up? You know, I don't mind the sit-in, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=370.0s)]
*  but I think it's missing the letter H. So I know the question is why are they doing this. I think [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  the better question is how can they do this? Like, doesn't it make you wonder, like, what do you do [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  all day if you can hang out all the time with, what's his face, Cory? What's his last name? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=390.16s)]
*  Booker. You can say it out loud. Booker. Yeah. 24, what, he spoke for 25. These people clearly [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=396.8s)]
*  aren't doing their job. Imagine if one of us on The Five, you never saw us on the show, but we [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  were always in the newspaper at social events, galas, charity events. The bosses would start [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=409.04s)]
*  thinking, maybe this person isn't necessary, and they'd fire you. They'd fire you on the spot. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=415.92s)]
*  Harold, I love it when you give them suggestions, but it's like you're trying to tell a corpse how [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=421.76s)]
*  to do Pilates. It's impossible. If the Democrats were a business, it's true. If the Democrats were [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=426.32s)]
*  a business, the front office is staffed by soulless morons. The back office is identity politics. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=433.44s)]
*  So that means whatever selling point they have against Trump becomes a selling point for him, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=440.8s)]
*  because a bad review from an idiot becomes a good review. It's like when a vegetarian reviews [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=446.24s)]
*  Ruth's Chris. So anytime they trash Trump, it's like, you know what? These people have no ideas, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  they have no vision. I get why they don't get them. They do desperately want the romance of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=459.68s)]
*  resistance. That's why they're doing it. But when they don't have an authentic self, it's just [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=465.92s)]
*  comedy. No substance. No substance. That's right. And coming up, feel the burn. Socialist Bernie [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=470.32s)]
*  Sanders is roasting the Democrats for having no vision. Click here to subscribe to the Fox News [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=477.2s)]
*  YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. You won't get it anywhere [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium7HQ7QweI&t=483.36s)]
