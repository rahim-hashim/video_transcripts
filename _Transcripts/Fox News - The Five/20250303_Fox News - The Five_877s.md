# ‘The Five’ reacts to fallout from Trump’s Zelenskyy smackdown
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8)
*  President Trump putting Zelensky on blast again after the Oval Office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=0.0s)]
*  smackdown heard around the world. 47 sending the Ukrainian leader to his room [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=4.32s)]
*  for having a bad attitude on a potential peace deal with Russia. And instead of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=8.76s)]
*  apologizing, Zelensky was running over to his European friends where he said, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=13.52s)]
*  quote, an agreement to end the war is still very, very far away and no one has [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=18.36s)]
*  started all these steps yet. President Trump not happy with that one. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=24.0s)]
*  We should be more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=29.56s)]
*  We've given them much more than Europe and Europe should have given more than us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  I want one thing to happen. I want all of those young people to stop being killed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=38.44s)]
*  They're being killed by the thousands every single week. The money is one [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=43.72s)]
*  thing but the death and they're losing thousands of soldiers a week. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=47.4s)]
*  He said he thinks the war is gonna go on for a long time and he better not be right about that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=52.2s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. Now maybe somebody doesn't want to make a deal and if [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=58.4s)]
*  somebody doesn't want to make a deal I think that person won't be around very long. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=62.8s)]
*  President Trump also teasing that he'll have more to say on a minerals deal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=65.72s)]
*  with Ukraine during his joint address to Congress, which she can catch special [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=69.96s)]
*  coverage starting tomorrow at 9 Eastern right here on Fox News Channel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=73.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Democrats in the media are screaming Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=78.44s)]
*  The White House has become an arm of the Kremlin. The Kremlin is delighted. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=84.28s)]
*  The only winner in that exchange is Putin. He's very much in Putin's camp. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=89.48s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, he is an enemy to the United States. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  And Secretary Rubio is pointing out how President Trump would be getting a Nobel [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=100.8s)]
*  Peace Prize over his efforts to end the war if only there was a D next to his name. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=105.28s)]
*  Shouldn't we all be happy that we have a president who's trying to stop wars and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=111.36s)]
*  prevent them instead of start them? And I just don't get it. I really don't. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  Other than the fact that it's Donald J. Trump, if this was a Democrat that was [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  doing this, everyone would be saying, well he's on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=125.32s)]
*  Judge Edine Pier, I'm not sure if we heard from you yet on this issue. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=128.92s)]
*  I'm so happy you came to me. I wasn't here on Friday. I was sick. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=133.24s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=136.92s)]
*  Thank you for welcoming me back like that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  OK, here's the deal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=140.4s)]
*  Zelensky was briefed on why he was supposed to be going to the Oval Office. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=141.4s)]
*  His people were briefed on what was going to happen in the Oval Office. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=146.0s)]
*  So he goes there knowing that the United States has given him $350 billion. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=149.56s)]
*  Gift, gift, gift. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=155.24s)]
*  The EU has given him $100 billion, which is a loan, a loan, a loan. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=157.0s)]
*  OK, so we're the suckers at the other end. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=160.92s)]
*  So Trump comes in. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=162.84s)]
*  He wants to end the killing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=164.76s)]
*  And Zelensky, at the end of the day, wants to keep fighting. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=166.8s)]
*  OK, he doesn't want to stop the fighting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=171.68s)]
*  He says, quote, since this, the end of the war with Russia is, quote, very, very far away. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=174.56s)]
*  Now, Zelensky wanted the moral condemnation of Putin. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=181.04s)]
*  Zelensky wanted and they started lecturing Donald Trump and J.D. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=186.04s)]
*  Vance about counting on you to stop Putin. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=191.28s)]
*  And Zelensky is then trying to renegotiate the deal, which is what got J.D. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=195.12s)]
*  Vance's back up. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  You say, you don't come here in front of the cameras to renegotiate the deal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=200.72s)]
*  You're here for a reason. Now, here's the stupidity of it all. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=203.68s)]
*  This guy, Zelensky, is playing checkers and Trump is playing chess. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  He wants to end the death. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=213.04s)]
*  He wants to end the war. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=214.6s)]
*  And how do we do that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=216.24s)]
*  Putin is an evil man. Trump knows that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=218.2s)]
*  He may say, you know, I've got to I understand him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  But more than anything, Trump wants to keep Putin from connecting with China to protect us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=224.28s)]
*  So with this mineral deal, we will have not just security and a collateral for our money, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=229.28s)]
*  but we'll have Americans there, businesses there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  We'll have boots on the ground, not military boots, but American feet on the ground. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=239.12s)]
*  And you can bet your bottom dollar, you idiot Zelensky, that with Americans on the ground, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=244.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to protect us if there is any invasion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=250.48s)]
*  How does he not understand that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=255.12s)]
*  His ego was so huge. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=257.28s)]
*  And then the Democrats come in, there's Chris Murphy and says, you know, don't take the deal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=259.0s)]
*  This guy, Zelensky, is a fool. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=263.28s)]
*  He had a fight with Biden. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=265.12s)]
*  Biden even yelled at him in 2022 and said, you're an ungrateful pig. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=266.64s)]
*  Does this deal go through with the minerals? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=272.32s)]
*  It should, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  When you look at what Ukraine has at hand, there's a negotiation to be made. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  There's a point at which they can come together. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=281.84s)]
*  And I think all of us have had a chance to watch what happened in the Oval Office play out many times. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=284.67999999999995s)]
*  Some of us have even tried to go back farther and see what that conversation was like before it came to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=290.0s)]
*  this severe disagreement or however you want to describe that moment that we all watched together. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=297.24s)]
*  And it was a cordial discussion before then. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=303.0s)]
*  Zelensky seems to keep putting himself into an awkward position that he's having to climb out of, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  saying to which the president responded, Zelensky saying this war is very far from being over. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  President Trump immediately took to true social and essentially said, paraphrasing, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=318.8s)]
*  what a ridiculously stupid statement. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=324.28s)]
*  There is a way to end this war and it's through peace. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=326.68s)]
*  And that is the word that the president continues to use. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=329.84s)]
*  So the country and the world is going to have to look forward to tomorrow night. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=331.96s)]
*  This is going to be critical because the president, when he was speaking today in the Roosevelt room with that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=335.8s)]
*  financial announcement, investments coming to America, he was asked about this in Q&A from reporters. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=340.8s)]
*  And he said, I'll have a lot to say about this tomorrow night. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  So he has said, Zelensky is welcome to come back to the table with conditions. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=349.8s)]
*  OK. And also highlighting among with all this Russia, Russia, Russia talk. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=354.68s)]
*  How about Europe? Everybody's quick to point out the media and the left to say, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  oh, look at our European allies, the way they're reacting to this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  They're also buying a lot of energy and oil and gas every single day from Russia, lining Russia's pockets. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  So we'll see what he has to say tomorrow night. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  But I think that's what's next in all of this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=373.12s)]
*  You were off also on Friday. Were you sick, too, Greg? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=375.68s)]
*  Well, that's what the judge told me to say. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we were together. We were both. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=381.84s)]
*  Yeah, rumors get started. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=384.32s)]
*  Yeah, I've got to take those pictures down off my only pants. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=385.92s)]
*  You know, there are two funny things going on right now. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  One, it's it's like you're watching the media walking in on a movie, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=392.08s)]
*  the third act, and they have no idea what happened before. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=396.64s)]
*  And it's like, oh, my God, one man is beating up another man. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=399.4s)]
*  This is terrible. And then you rewind and you find out the guy that's getting beaten up [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=402.24s)]
*  had it coming. Yeah, he's a criminal and he deserved it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=406.6s)]
*  So right right now, I find it funny because to me, this is a negotiation process. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=409.72s)]
*  Anybody who's been in a negotiation knows there's always a walk out or a blow up. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  I've done it, I don't know, 10 times. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=421.32s)]
*  I get up whenever I'm in contract negotiations, I leave. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=424.56s)]
*  It's the best tip for anybody. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  Get up and leave. Yep. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=430.76s)]
*  And you know what happened? It reset. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=433.72s)]
*  My prediction is, of course, there's a deal. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=436.16s)]
*  Yeah, this was just this is just a little step along the way. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=438.35999999999996s)]
*  And anybody who freaks out about it has never actually this is the god of transparency. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump just showed you how negotiations work. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  He might throw you out. He might. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=450.79999999999995s)]
*  He turned this whole thing into celebrity apprentice. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's a business. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  He realizes that if you want peace in the world, you don't spread democracy. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=457.11999999999995s)]
*  You spread business because you make create business relationships with people [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=462.52s)]
*  and then they don't want to kill you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  So the question then, the funniest part is like, what do the Democrats do? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=470.24s)]
*  How do you respond to once again, this blunt common sense? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=474.56s)]
*  It's always going to be about the methods. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=479.52s)]
*  So whether it's about solving the border crisis or doze or now Ukraine, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  what's the pattern? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=486.84s)]
*  Because Trump is right on all three, especially Ukraine, when he says, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=488.44s)]
*  look at all these dead people. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=493.28s)]
*  And this is a consistent, consistent Trumpian [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=494.72s)]
*  vibe. He's a pacifist. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=500.32s)]
*  Hates war. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=501.96s)]
*  He may hate it from a sober perspective that it's such a waste [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=502.92s)]
*  or he may be emotional about it. Who knows? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=506.0s)]
*  He hates war. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=508.12s)]
*  So he's right on Ukraine. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=509.2s)]
*  He's right on Doze. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=510.8s)]
*  He's right on the border. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=512.24s)]
*  So if you're right on all those things, what do you argue about the methods? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=513.76s)]
*  You know, the border is already changed for the better. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=519.04s)]
*  We know that it feels different. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=521.08s)]
*  But it's what he did was so mean. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=523.12s)]
*  Then you look at Doze, the American public's behind Doze. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=525.2s)]
*  But he's so mean the way he's doing it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=528.36s)]
*  Then you talk about, you're great. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=530.88s)]
*  Did you see what he did to Zelensky? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=531.76s)]
*  Doesn't matter. He's right. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=534.04s)]
*  He's right. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=536.32s)]
*  So you can argue about what he how he's doing it and that it's so harsh [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=537.44s)]
*  and unbecoming. It doesn't matter [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=541.24s)]
*  because he's right about the solution. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=544.6s)]
*  So you can quibble all you want. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=547.96s)]
*  We have a new president. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=550.32s)]
*  He's got a pulse. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=551.8s)]
*  He doesn't need a life alert. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=553.28s)]
*  Zelensky just found out that maybe he should wear a suit next time. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  Those are tiny little things, tiny little things. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  The big deal is when you're right on the issues, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=561.76s)]
*  sometimes you got to be harsh in all those areas. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=564.76s)]
*  He's the adult in the room, which is exactly what we voted for. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=567.4s)]
*  How proud, Jessica, will you be when Donald Trump receives the Nobel Peace Prize? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=571.64s)]
*  I hope he invites me to Sweden so that I can be there in the audience to cheer him on. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=576.76s)]
*  So. I get it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=582.8s)]
*  There are a lot of people in the your words hurt my feelings bucket, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=585.64s)]
*  and that is not the place to be when you're looking at something like this. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  But I do think that it's important to consider the fact that this, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=594.24s)]
*  quote unquote, peace deal that he's offering means that Zelensky [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=597.3199999999999s)]
*  essentially cedes his country to Russia. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=601.68s)]
*  And no one has explained what the sudden change in the last couple of weeks [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=604.56s)]
*  in the way that Donald Trump is talking about Ukraine and Zelensky is spurred by. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=609.36s)]
*  He didn't used to call Zelensky a dictator. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=614.4s)]
*  He didn't used to say that his people hated him. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=616.92s)]
*  He didn't used to say he had a four percent approval rating. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=619.4s)]
*  He didn't used to say any of the total blasphemy [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=622.08s)]
*  that he's been throwing out there in the last few weeks. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk also on Twitter a couple of days ago saying, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=628.6s)]
*  I agree to someone who said that the US should get out of NATO and the UN. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=632.92s)]
*  These are all things that bad. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=637.2s)]
*  I couldn't come up with the right word. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=639.48s)]
*  What? OK, well, I have a good chuckle at it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=640.6800000000001s)]
*  These are all things that Putin wants to hear. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=644.2800000000001s)]
*  And you know that because his own spokesman, Peskov, said as much said, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=647.72s)]
*  the rapidly changing US foreign policy configurations largely coincides with our vision. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  Dmitry Medvedev, the insolent pig about Zelensky, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=656.36s)]
*  finally got a proper slapdown in the Oval Office. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=659.5200000000001s)]
*  Trump is right. The Kiev regime is gambling with World War Three. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=661.96s)]
*  So if you are satisfying someone that we all agree as a dictator and authoritarian [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=666.56s)]
*  to that level, don't you think maybe the methods aren't that great? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=672.24s)]
*  And that's not to say that we don't need to come to the table and say, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=675.68s)]
*  this is what our peace plan is. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=678.24s)]
*  These are the territorial lines that we are comfortable with. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=679.52s)]
*  No one thinks that he's going back to a pre 2014 era. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  Zelensky himself doesn't think that I don't think it's smart, though, Jessica. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=685.52s)]
*  But you just made a case about it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=689.8399999999999s)]
*  We worry about the fact somebody else might agree with your perspective. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  If that's what you believe, if Trump believe there's no OK, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=695.8000000000001s)]
*  Putin doesn't want this war. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=699.2s)]
*  Zelensky doesn't want this war. Trump doesn't want. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  So they're all in agreement. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=703.0s)]
*  But they're not in agreement because this actually has to come down to the brass [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=704.24s)]
*  tax of how that country gets and who holds the cards. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=707.7600000000001s)]
*  I get it. I get it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=711.1600000000001s)]
*  I heard Tommy Tuberville was on TV today saying this is about what Putin [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=713.24s)]
*  and Donald Trump want. This doesn't have to do with Zelensky. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=717.12s)]
*  But guess what? There are millions of Ukrainians who are dead. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=719.44s)]
*  To differ. No, they're not. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=721.88s)]
*  Already dead. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=723.6800000000001s)]
*  They don't have a future with him. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  They do not have a future with Zelensky. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=726.52s)]
*  Zelensky is dependent upon us. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=728.96s)]
*  Do you guys get what you're saying? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=730.96s)]
*  You're just saying that a sovereign country. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=732.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes, I do. But what we're saying is maybe I should know. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=734.2s)]
*  You know, I know exactly what I was saying. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=737.08s)]
*  Ukraine to start building and stop the killing. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=738.9200000000001s)]
*  Nobody's making it part of Russia. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=742.36s)]
*  You're telling them you can't be part of NATO. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=744.64s)]
*  You're telling them you don't get your territory back. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=746.6s)]
*  They were made upon decades ago. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=748.88s)]
*  And every decade they move closer and closer to Russia, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=750.84s)]
*  NATO has, and the Crimea and everything else is a response to NATO. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=754.36s)]
*  Poor Russia. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=758.84s)]
*  NATO encroaching on them. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=760.16s)]
*  They are an independent country who believes... [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=761.92s)]
*  And I'm not pro-Russia at all. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=764.76s)]
*  Really? It doesn't sound like that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=766.4399999999999s)]
*  Don't give me that, really. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=767.88s)]
*  Don't give me that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=769.2s)]
*  You know what? The truth is they stand for this [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=770.72s)]
*  and they don't want NATO any closer. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=773.96s)]
*  And it's been decades that that's been agreed to. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=776.28s)]
*  They invaded a sovereign nation and killed tens of thousands of things, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=778.64s)]
*  stolen their children. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=782.28s)]
*  Three years ago... [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  One second, Jessica. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=784.6800000000001s)]
*  Three years ago, I sat here and I said, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  the Russian-Ukrainian thing is like a family fight across the street. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=787.52s)]
*  We don't want to go over there and get in between a family fight. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=792.88s)]
*  We did. It's three years later. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=796.84s)]
*  I'm still waiting to hear what Jessica's plan is [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=799.72s)]
*  to remove Russia from eastern Ukraine. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=802.12s)]
*  What? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=804.84s)]
*  We haven't heard that yet from you. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=805.84s)]
*  So until you tell us what your peace deal is, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  I think this is probably the better deal. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=809.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=811.36s)]
*  Jessica, how are you going to get the Russians out of eastern Ukraine? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uiYJjF1k8&t=812.36s)]
