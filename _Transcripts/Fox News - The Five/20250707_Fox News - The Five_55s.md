# Kellyanne Conway slams Dems for choosing ‘hysteria over compassion’ #shorts #texas #weather #us
**Fox News - The Five:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800)
*  The modern Democratic Party, it's hysteria over compassion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=0.0s)]
*  It is Trump derangement syndrome, definitely. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=3.92s)]
*  And it's confrontation over collaboration. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=7.36s)]
*  And they let that go here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=9.28s)]
*  Last point, Trump's the one. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=10.84s)]
*  He got late September, early October, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=13.08s)]
*  he went down to North Carolina after that tragedy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=15.56s)]
*  He and Melania went out to the fires [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=18.44s)]
*  right after he was sworn in. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=20.44s)]
*  He goes for the crisis and the pain exists. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=21.96s)]
*  And he tries to go when they won't be in the way [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=25.72s)]
*  of rescue and recovery. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=28.2s)]
*  He goes to share people's pain [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  and try to add some compassion, some federal resources. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=33.08s)]
*  The Democratic Party is so hollowed out [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  in their anger and their misery and their bitterness [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  towards one man who's on a two-week hot streak [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=42.2s)]
*  that they can't even express enough compassion [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=45.08s)]
*  to the loss of life, which includes kids our own ages. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROD8rwvv800&t=48.519999999999996s)]
