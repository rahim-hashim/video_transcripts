# ‘The Five’: Michelle Obama plays the fear card over Trump’s most popular policy
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg)
*  Michelle Obama is playing the fear card over Trump's most popular policy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=0.0s)]
*  The American people absolutely love 47's aggressive immigration crackdown as he sends murderers, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=5.88s)]
*  rapists and MS-13 gang members packing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=12.8s)]
*  A new poll, Fox poll, shows 55% of voters approve of how he's handling border security. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=15.8s)]
*  But the former first lady isn't a fan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=22.96s)]
*  In this current climate for me, it's what's happening to immigrants. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=27.5s)]
*  So it's not the fear for myself anymore. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=33.3s)]
*  There's so much bias and so much racism and so much ignorance that fuels those kind of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=37.14s)]
*  choices. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=42.22s)]
*  I worry for people of color all over this country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=43.66s)]
*  And I don't know that we will have the advocates to protect everybody. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=48.58s)]
*  And that makes me, that frightens me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  It keeps me up at night. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=57.1s)]
*  But if Michelle is mad about deportation, she might want to check with her hubby. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=59.98s)]
*  Former President Obama earned the nickname, Deporter in Chief, after booting 3 million [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=66.14s)]
*  illegals. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=72.06s)]
*  And check out this wild scene. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=73.3s)]
*  In San Antonio, a migrant is now hiding in a tree after local authorities attempted [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=75.58s)]
*  to execute a warrant for deportation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=81.72s)]
*  But he fled. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=84.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=86.9s)]
*  So I'm kind of torn between how you get this guy down from the tree. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=87.9s)]
*  But you know what, Jesse, if Michelle can't sleep at night because she's so worried about [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=91.7s)]
*  deportations, her husband was the Deporter in Chief. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=96.58000000000001s)]
*  How did she sleep when she was married to him? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=103.44s)]
*  Well, I don't want to get into their bedroom situation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=105.9s)]
*  Good idea. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  I never want to get involved in their marriage. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  But because she made her marriage my business, I will share my thoughts on it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=111.98s)]
*  If I were Barack, I'd be angry. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=116.86s)]
*  You can't have your wife go out and do a podcast and start talking about your personal life, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=119.86s)]
*  your romantic life, and disparaging you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=124.30000000000001s)]
*  Not just because he's the president or the former president. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  Any man doesn't want his wife going out there and airing their dirty laundry. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=129.82s)]
*  Why is she playing the race card? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=134.22s)]
*  Why is she making her husband out to be a bad guy? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=135.5s)]
*  Why is she skipping state funerals and inaugurations? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=138.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=142.34s)]
*  But her aura used to be here, and it's here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  You don't go from first lady to bestselling author to a whiny podcast host. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what the hype was about her, but she's just like her husband. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  Without a teleprompter, they're not that insightful. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=160.86s)]
*  All she's saying is when a black president was deporting, it was great. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=163.82s)]
*  But when a white president's doing, it's racist. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=167.28s)]
*  You can get that from Joy Reid. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=169.76s)]
*  Why is she saying this to me? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=171.68s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=173.44s)]
*  The whole thing about worrying, Judge, and I know you agree, women worry differently [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=174.66s)]
*  than men. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=180.16s)]
*  Men prepare so they don't have to worry. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=182.56s)]
*  Women worry about what might happen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=189.48s)]
*  Men prepare for what could happen. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=192.58s)]
*  Are you saying women don't prepare? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=194.0s)]
*  Liberal women worry about what could happen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=196.0s)]
*  I'm going to stop you in your tracks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=202.0s)]
*  Republican women prepare to, Judge. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=205.0s)]
*  This is not a sexual thing or gender, whatever the difference is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=207.64s)]
*  Jesse, that's enough. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=211.52s)]
*  This is about ideology. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=212.52s)]
*  And if Joe Biden had done his job, she wouldn't have to worry. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=214.56s)]
*  Think about it like that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=219.02s)]
*  I can't. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=220.02s)]
*  It's sleepy's fault. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=221.02s)]
*  Jessica, that's a good show. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=222.02s)]
*  I have an idea about getting this guy out of the tree, too. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=223.02s)]
*  Treat him like a cat. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=225.16s)]
*  You have the fire department come and they do what they do. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=226.6s)]
*  Look, see them? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=230.48s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=231.48s)]
*  Whatever they do, get a ladder, shake a branch, get them down. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=232.48s)]
*  I'm going to put you on the Warren squad, okay, to go out and pick these people up. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  You know what, Jessica, you know what bothers me? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=240.92s)]
*  Well, Michelle Obama says she fears for people of color, so she has to say something. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  Is that why she never said anything about the women, the Americans who were held hostage [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  in Hamas? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  Because they weren't people of color? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=255.52s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that the Obamas have spoken about October 7th and the hostage crisis. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=257.84s)]
*  And they did as well, I think, at the DNC. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=263.0s)]
*  I don't really even know what to say about Jesse's woman thing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  I actually don't know what to say. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=274.16s)]
*  It was so insane. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=275.76s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=276.76s)]
*  I'll do that more often. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=277.76s)]
*  There is a huge difference between the approval on border security and the feelings overall [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=279.88s)]
*  on how immigration policy is being executed at this point. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=286.8s)]
*  And Donald Trump is now underwater with immigration because people don't like the things that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=291.04s)]
*  are going on. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=296.52s)]
*  They are hearing the stories about people with no criminal record who have not been [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=297.52s)]
*  convicted of anything being deported, not just their home countries, sometimes to an [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=301.44s)]
*  El Salvadorian prison camp. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=305.54s)]
*  And there are Americans that are being detained by ICE. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=308.12s)]
*  And it's not just one person. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=311.0s)]
*  It's not two people. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=312.2s)]
*  Yesterday, the story from Oklahoma, a woman and her daughters, her minor daughters, asleep [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=313.4s)]
*  in their home. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=319.44s)]
*  You already talked about that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=320.44s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=321.44s)]
*  It was another. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=322.44s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=323.44s)]
*  This is another mother with two kids? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=324.44s)]
*  Well, the first mother had three kids. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=325.44s)]
*  I'm glad you're so interested. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=327.04s)]
*  But yes, this is multiple families being devastated by ICE. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=328.04s)]
*  But this one is American. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=333.4s)]
*  And that's why it matters. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=334.44s)]
*  ICE came into the house. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=335.44s)]
*  There had been people, immigrants who had lived there, and they moved out a few weeks [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=336.84s)]
*  earlier. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=340.64s)]
*  This family had just moved in. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=341.64s)]
*  They came in. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=343.11999999999995s)]
*  They made them go outside, including the girls were taken outside in their underwear. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=344.11999999999995s)]
*  They took their money and their electronics. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=347.84s)]
*  This is an American family. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=350.28s)]
*  Does that happen to any? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  No one even believes your story anymore. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and you know what? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  They rectify it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  They always fall apart. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=355.47999999999996s)]
*  By the way, let me tell you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  Literally none of it has fallen apart. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  What about the Maryland dad? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  Never happened to him. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=359.47999999999996s)]
*  That didn't fall apart. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  He's still in some places. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  He's MS-13, Jessica. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  He is not. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  And there are two orders of deportation on him. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=365.48s)]
*  And he lied about being afraid to go back to El Salvador because he had to admit he [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=368.64000000000004s)]

*  Keep going back to one person that you think you have a case about. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=373.44s)]
*  If someone dragged you out of your house in the middle of the night, you would kill somebody. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=375.44s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  And I'll tell you something else that you said that wasn't true. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  A Hamas hostage, Nama Levi's father, shames Michelle Obama for saying nothing about the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=383.88s)]
*  hostages. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  Her silence speaks loudly, is his quote. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=393.48s)]
*  So don't say things if you don't know what you're talking about. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=396.36s)]
*  Dana, what happened to Michelle Obama? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=398.88s)]
*  I find this, I don't know. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=402.16s)]
*  I think that it's very curious. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=404.0s)]
*  I spent a year making bets with Jessie that she was not going to run for president because [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  she says that she hates politics. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=409.6s)]
*  I do not understand the decision to go from the most popular woman in America and possibly [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=412.56s)]
*  the world, except for Meghan Markle. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=416.92s)]
*  Having the books, the platform, the Netflix, everything to do a podcast with your brother [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=421.68s)]
*  that doesn't get any viewers and then to make decisions that put you right in the middle [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=429.36s)]
*  of politics. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=435.64000000000004s)]
*  So I don't know whether Jessie was, I don't know whether, I'm not apologizing because [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=437.12s)]
*  you lost the bet. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=441.44s)]
*  But now I find it curious. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=443.6s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=446.0s)]
*  I think that if you have this amazing platform where pretty much everyone loves you, why [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=447.0s)]
*  you choose to ruin that with one podcast with your brother? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=451.72s)]
*  I think that's weird. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=455.6s)]
*  Do you have any ideas, Greg? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=456.6s)]
*  Well, for one thing, I never believe anybody who says that an issue keeps them up at night. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=458.12s)]
*  It's usually spicy foods. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=463.36s)]
*  But Michelle Obama says the deportations keep her up at night. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=467.0s)]
*  So maybe there is some truth to Barack's birth certificate. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=471.02s)]
*  And way to tip off Trump. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=474.02s)]
*  Oh, please, I'm really worried about these deportations. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=475.32s)]
*  I mean, just get a divorce already. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  Don't try to get him deported. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=482.08s)]
*  There's a lot of conflation going on here. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=483.08s)]
*  Deporting illegal immigrants isn't the same as deporting citizens. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=487.6s)]
*  And the polling among Hispanic Americans proves that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=490.82s)]
*  The most deeply Hispanic county in America, Star County, it flipped red. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=493.32s)]
*  Trump lost by 60 points in 2016. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=498.96s)]
*  He was returned to power by the Hispanic working class. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=502.6s)]
*  Up 14 points from 2020. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  46% of self-identified Hispanics picked Trump. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  That's the highest since the 1970s. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=512.88s)]
*  He won 55% of Hispanic men. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=515.4s)]
*  You want to know why? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=518.4200000000001s)]
*  Because men tend to favor law and order and following the rules. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=519.7s)]
*  That was the cornerstone of his campaign, was immigration. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=524.48s)]
*  So you might have a problem with the methods in some ways. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=528.32s)]
*  Might be a little loose, but all is going pretty good. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpVFCXwczg&t=531.76s)]
