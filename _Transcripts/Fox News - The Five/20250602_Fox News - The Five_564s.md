# 'The Five' on why Dems are still in the dumps
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk)
*  Trying to help you? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=0.0s)]
*  What the f*** is up with Trump always chickening out on tariffs? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=1.0s)]
*  The Democrats just can't quit the cringe. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=10.0s)]
*  Your favorite Congressman Eric Swalwell posting a video of himself eating a taco to try to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=13.0s)]
*  troll President Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=18.8s)]
*  Because that's the new strategy now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=20.3s)]
*  Be tougher, meaner, and somehow dumber. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=22.12s)]
*  Enter Kamala's truck-fixing failed Veep. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=25.56s)]
*  Tim Woles thinks that bullying Trump will solve all of their problems. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  But be very afraid if Tim Woles enters your gym. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=55.56s)]
*  The Democrats, get this, are now being encouraged to court young men while they're exercising [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=73.56s)]
*  and lifting weights. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=79.08s)]
*  Check out this headline from MSNBC. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=80.76s)]
*  Do we even vote, bro? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=82.56s)]
*  Democrats should look for new voters at the gym. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=85.56s)]
*  Oh, Harold, please make sense of this strategy because at first blush, it just looks like [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=87.56s)]
*  utter nonsense. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=93.16s)]
*  Because it is. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=94.56s)]
*  When I hear Governor Walton, I hear some Democrats, a lot of other Democrats talking. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=97.22s)]
*  It's almost like fingernail scratching on chalkboard. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=103.56s)]
*  Not just the way they sound, but what they're saying also. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=106.44s)]
*  Everyone has to take a step back in the party. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=110.56s)]
*  I know, I've shared before, we lost the race and there's frustration that mounts on top [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=112.56s)]
*  of frustration on top of frustration because we're watching President Trump and there's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=118.56s)]
*  some things that we believe we would be doing differently and there are things that irritate [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=122.76s)]
*  us if not all together antagonize us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=126.64s)]
*  But that happens every presidential race when the party who doesn't win is watching from [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=129.32s)]
*  the outside. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=133.52s)]
*  The question is, what do you do? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=134.52s)]
*  We have to react less to Trump and begin more, instead spell out what it is we would do differently [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=136.32s)]
*  to make life more affordable for people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  Give you one tangible example. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=144.32s)]
*  Artificial intelligence, we talked a little bit about in the last segment, the inevitability [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=146.72s)]
*  of that gripping every aspect of our economy not only could make it where people are losing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=149.68s)]
*  jobs but also could make the prices of things go up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Why aren't we thinking about ways to prepare the workforce and the economy for the inevitability [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=158.28s)]
*  To ensure that we have whatever we may need, more kids studying liberal arts because there [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=163.72s)]
*  are going to be machines that can do some of the math and science, trying to promote [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=168.92s)]
*  hard work and determination, something you really can't teach but we've got to figure [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=172.88s)]
*  out ways how we make America better and better suited for what's coming. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=176.24s)]
*  What we're doing is not working. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=181.12s)]
*  It may make us feel good. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=183.2s)]
*  Now I've got to tell you, the whole taco thing I think is kind of funny and I think that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=184.2s)]
*  Democrats who want to make a little hay of that should make a little hay of that but [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=188.04s)]
*  understand that can't be the focus and the fundamentals of any counter to President Trump. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=190.96s)]
*  He's proper because he's doing things and when people look at us they don't take us [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=198.2s)]
*  credibly or seriously. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  We've got to be taken credibly on cultural issues and then lay out an alternative agenda [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  around making America more affordable again. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=206.92s)]
*  That's where President Trump is falling and that's where we should be lifting up but all [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=210.56s)]
*  this silliness you guys are doing now, nobody's listening. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=214.12s)]
*  Jesse, this common sense is nowhere to be found because they're still throwing Tim Walz [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=217.48s)]
*  up the Clyburn FET front and center, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  He's the main stage, he's the keynote speaker. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=223.32s)]
*  So why is that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=225.7s)]
*  There's no common sense anywhere in their strategy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=226.7s)]
*  Well they're fighting Trump instead of fighting for the American people. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=230.0s)]
*  Trump is not the son. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=233.6s)]
*  Not everything revolves around him. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=235.04s)]
*  If you focus on the American people instead of the President, the people will appreciate [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=237.12s)]
*  that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=242.12s)]
*  The thing the Democrats are saying about the gym, you can't campaign at the gym. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=244.24s)]
*  Democrats have to go into the gym. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=248.44s)]
*  They have to work out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=250.34s)]
*  Working out actually makes you more masculine. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=252.52s)]
*  It increases your testosterone. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=255.36s)]
*  Well you need to lift harder and heavier. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=258.24s)]
*  It makes you more competitive, it makes you happier, healthier, all that stuff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=262.44s)]
*  Being around other guys is also good for you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=266.48s)]
*  Good sauna, a plan of fitness. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=270.0s)]
*  And women are more attracted to guys that lift. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=273.44s)]
*  And that's just scientifically proven. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=276.04s)]
*  Now I was at a resort a little while back and I saw Senator Thune at the gym. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=277.92s)]
*  The man is jacked and the guy is in great shape and he lifts hard. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=284.32s)]
*  If you look at Schumer, he's built like a woman. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=288.08s)]
*  Now men do not want to be led by the party of women. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=292.08s)]
*  Men want to be led by other men. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=296.1s)]
*  So Democrats need to become men and then they can persuade men. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=297.88s)]
*  But they have to lift first. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=302.5s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=304.9s)]
*  There's a quote by Maya Angelou. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=305.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=308.58s)]
*  Did you ask permission from Dana before you keep going? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=309.58s)]
*  People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=313.02s)]
*  forget how you made them feel. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=316.66s)]
*  People don't like the way they feel around Democrats. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=319.54s)]
*  Because Democrats don't like the way they feel. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=322.3s)]
*  And if they lifted, they feel better and then everybody around them would feel better. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=326.18s)]
*  You had me at Maya. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=330.18s)]
*  What about the bullying thing? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=331.18s)]
*  We just talked about how rhetoric gets you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=332.18s)]
*  So Tim Walz is saying it's better to be meaner, not smarter. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=336.38s)]
*  So be aware of that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=340.18s)]
*  And also it's tough time for the party of Thomas Jefferson. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  In today's news roundup that we got this morning, the losing candidates from the Democratic [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=346.06s)]
*  ticket were given profiles in the national newspapers about their future political ambitions. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=352.34000000000003s)]
*  And yet their political stock continues to go down. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=358.42s)]
*  Waltz himself said, I was a terrible candidate. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=362.14000000000004s)]
*  To me, I'm like, you just took yourself out of the race. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=364.94s)]
*  But if you take out Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, then you go to Bernie Sanders and AOC, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=367.7s)]
*  and then you get back to the whole thing of being meaner and growing a beard does not [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  mean that you actually have any good policy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=376.3s)]
*  I learned something today that I didn't know. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=379.14s)]
*  Way back when the Tea Party first started, Speaker Boehner told his members to go there, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  sit in the back and listen. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=387.9s)]
*  And it seems to me if the Democrats could find a way to do that, maybe it's at the gym. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=390.14s)]
*  It would help them. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=394.21999999999997s)]
*  The thing is, Greg, don't you think what they're doing is so performative, like it's all social [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  media centered. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=399.18s)]
*  Talk about that there's been no greater chasm between them and their constituents, I argue, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=400.62s)]
*  than now when the Democrats are just chasing likes rather than chasing any kind of actual [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  support. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=410.46s)]
*  That's a very good point, Emily. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=411.74s)]
*  I just want to point out that we like tacos. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=413.82s)]
*  That's why this doesn't work. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=417.42s)]
*  We like tacos. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=419.26s)]
*  Swallow should have been doing Chinese food. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=420.26s)]
*  I mean, his chopstick was found in a wonton. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=422.42s)]
*  Come on, buddy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=426.3s)]
*  By the way, Tim Walz is a clown in search of a circus because the Dems big top collapsed. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  And now he's just like a weird older guy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=434.42s)]
*  And when you get older, and I'm getting there, I'm still in my 40s, you should have a little [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=438.1s)]
*  bit of wisdom. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=442.78s)]
*  People want to have what you have. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=444.46s)]
*  There should be some age related growth. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=447.1s)]
*  But when you see him, he's kind of like a sloppy, impulsive baby. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJY7WHtkhk&t=449.06s)]
