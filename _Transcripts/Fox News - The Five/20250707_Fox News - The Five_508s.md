# ‘The Five’ reacts to apocalyptic flash floods in Texas
**Fox News - The Five:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE)
*  When the president guts all of the early warning systems and the weathering forecast abilities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=0.0s)]
*  of the government, these are the results that we're going to start to see on a daily basis. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=7.44s)]
*  The incident comes as the Trump administration is making deep cuts to weather forecasting services. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=13.52s)]
*  We're also learning that there were significant staffing shortfalls of the National Weather [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=20.96s)]
*  Services offices in the region. I don't think it's helpful to have missing key personnel [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=30.4s)]
*  At the White House, correcting the record. The National Weather Service provided early and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=35.6s)]
*  consistent warnings. They gave out timely flash flood alerts. There were record-breaking lead times [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=41.2s)]
*  in the lead-up to this catastrophe. There is ongoing flood monitoring, and these offices [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  were well-staffed. In fact, one of the offices was actually overstaffed. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=52.48s)]
*  So just take it from me. Politicizing weather events is not good, and it shouldn't happen, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=57.36s)]
*  but this happened, Jesse, and great to have you back. Around 4 a.m., when everyone was asleep, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  the river was rising, there was a torrential downpour, so the conditions were absolutely [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  horrendous. Yeah, Dana, we're praying for the families and hope they do find some survivors. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=71.28s)]
*  There's a school of thought in the left that says the more people you have, the better results you [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=75.84s)]
*  get. I don't know about that, because imagine this show was called The Ten, and they blew up [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=81.12s)]
*  the table and everybody talked. You'd never have time for Animals Are Great, and they'd have to pay [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  this, these people twice as much. They call that CNN. They call the boxes. Yes. Exactly. Or look at [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  the, I think they call it the Golden Age of Hollywood, Jessica. Pay attention to this one. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=102.0s)]
*  Back in the day, they had one studio head, okay, and he was the risk-taker, made all the decisions, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=106.56s)]
*  and he had an army of writers, producers, and directors. So he'd approve a script, they'd get [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=111.68s)]
*  it up, and all of a sudden box office hit. Today, there's, I don't know, an army of executives. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  They have so many people making decisions that no decision ever gets done, so they just have to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=124.56s)]
*  reboot old hits. Like, that's why you have Jurassic Park 17. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=129.76s)]
*  Stephanopoulos should lose his job. This guy's already cost Disney $20 million. He's making [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=135.84s)]
*  about $20 million, and he's got to go, because he says that they're understaffed. Now, with the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=141.44s)]
*  resources that ABC has, they could make one phone call and find out they had plenty of people, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=145.92s)]
*  but Politico, with a fraction of the staff, gets the right answer. So this guy's going to get iced [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=150.56s)]
*  out for the next four years. No one's going to touch him, and he's just dead man walking. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=156.08s)]
*  These people have emotional problems and bad religion. Let me give you an example, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  Jessica, and it's good to be back around the table. This climate change thing is a religion [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  to these people, because they believe that weather is punishing us for being a rich and successful [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=171.28s)]
*  and prosperous nation, and all they need to do to appease the rain gods is to have everybody use [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  their sacred things like solar panels and super cars and windmills, and that's what's going to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=183.04s)]
*  save lives. All right? And then you have people that blame everything on Donald Trump. So if they [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=190.32s)]
*  get fired, if they stub their toe, if there's a virus, it's his fault. And so you're walking [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=195.28s)]
*  around and dealing with people that are like suspicious pagans. All right? Everything they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=200.32s)]
*  see, they see as a conspiracy. They're superstitious, but we're not in this anymore. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  We used to have to battle these people. We are in an age of common sense. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=209.2s)]
*  Jessica, I will go to you next. You don't have to. You can choose to comment on whatever you want, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  but it is good to have Jesse back on the table. I do think it's a little wild. And when it comes [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=219.6s)]
*  to certain news stories, it's let's wait, let's get all the facts, let's see. But if it's blame [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=224.16s)]
*  Trump, that's like all systems go. Well, you could actually do that for any [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Republicans too. Yeah. At large. Take it from me. Listen, this is one of the more [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=234.0s)]
*  devastating stories that I think we've had to cover as a mother of two daughters that are going to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=240.16s)]
*  go to camp at some point. I cannot even imagine what that feels like. I've been reading the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=246.8s)]
*  testimonials, especially about the fathers and grandfathers that are walking around that camp [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=251.76s)]
*  looking for a thermos with their kids name on it or some sign that they were there. Maybe they [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=257.52s)]
*  find the body of another camper. Maybe they find their own child or grandchild. Unimaginable. I'm [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=264.96s)]
*  so sorry for them. And I'm sorry for any hurt that any comments about this tragedy has caused [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  these families. I don't think that talking about preparedness or what might have helped [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=278.4s)]
*  qualifies as impugning the memory of those that have been lost or detracting from the thoughtful [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=286.16s)]
*  conversation that needs to take place because this river has been flooding for a very long time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=294.48s)]
*  There are a number of instances in this and we were here around the table when Hurricane [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=299.04s)]
*  Helene struck and I did not hear Jesse Waters, who I'm thrilled is back around the table, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=304.88s)]
*  saying that Donald Trump should stop spreading lies about the Biden administration and the FEMA [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  funds. Trump came out and he said they're giving your FEMA dollars to illegals. They're housing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=315.92s)]
*  them with your FEMA dollars. Then he said you're only going to get $750 from FEMA, which was a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=322.16s)]
*  complete lie. And there are Republican officials who have testified to the fact that people did [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=326.88s)]
*  not get their FEMA assistance because of what Trump and other Republicans were saying. You also [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  don't need to trust or go to Democrats to politicize it. You can look at this GOP state rep, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=335.92s)]
*  Wes Burdell, who said that he would have voted differently on a bill that was before the House [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=340.8s)]
*  last year, I think it was House Bill number 13, that was going to add more money for disaster [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=346.56s)]
*  response and better alert systems, radio towers, et cetera. There are over $54 billion in identified [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=351.68s)]
*  needs in terms of disaster resistance when it comes to these kinds of flash floods that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=359.12s)]
*  state officials are asking for and the GOP legislature has rejected them. That is something [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=364.24s)]
*  that they can work on to move forward and hopefully avoid a tragedy like this again. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=369.6s)]
*  And, well, Kellyanne, I think one thing that we always are constantly reminded of, especially [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=373.44s)]
*  even with Hurricane Helene, is that state and local governments are the ones that are on the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=377.44s)]
*  front lines of defense and the federal government can help, but they're not necessarily the ones to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=381.12s)]
*  blame. That's right. They're on the first level of defense, but they're also the ones who tend to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=385.12s)]
*  issue the warnings and then go out to rescue and recover. I mean, the left is very culpable in this [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  one, Jessica, respectfully. They had this playbook now. Number one, blame Trump. Number two, lie [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=395.28s)]
*  in the service of blaming Trump. Refer to number one. And number three, give us your thoughts, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=401.84s)]
*  never even your prayers. Why aren't they out there helping with rescue and recovery? Why aren't they [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=406.4s)]
*  looking for the thermoses? Why aren't they crediting and lifting up this hero who saved lives at 168? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=410.55999999999995s)]
*  Why isn't he a household name? Trump, Trump, Trump and everything. And it turns out all of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  it's just a lie. Dan Abash, George Stephanopoulos, Al Sharpton and other Democrats in the media and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=420.88s)]
*  other Democrats everywhere lying climate change. People are talking about climate change from the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  comfy cockpits of their fossil fuel guzzling private aircraft telling the rest of us what [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=432.88s)]
*  just went wrong, who's to blame while people are still looking for loved ones. We didn't have this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  when I was growing up. We, we, everybody got together. I think the modern democratic party, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=443.92s)]
*  it's hysteria over compassion. It is Trump derangement syndrome definitely. And it's [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=448.8s)]
*  confrontation over collaboration. And they let that go here. Last point, Trump's the one. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=454.8s)]
*  He got late September, early October, he went down to North Carolina after that tragedy. He and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=460.32s)]
*  Melania went out to the fires right after he was sworn in. He goes for the crisis and the pain [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=465.92s)]
*  exists. And he tries to go when they won't be in the way of rescue and recovery. He goes to, he goes [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=471.68s)]
*  to share people's pain and try to add some compassion, some federal resources. The [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=478.8s)]
*  democratic party is so hollowed out in their anger and their misery and their bitterness [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  towards one man who's on a two week hot streak that they can't even express enough compassion [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  to the loss of life, which includes, you know, kids our own ages. Yeah. Click here to subscribe [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=495.6s)]
*  to the Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=501.12s)]
*  You won't get it anywhere else. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e-0_1gmxKE&t=506.40000000000003s)]
