# Jesse Watters: The Democrats don't have any ideas
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE)
*  Elon Musk and his Doge team dispelling attacks from Democrats about what they are up to in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=0.0s)]
*  their quest to slash government waste. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=9.72s)]
*  Musk flanked by CEOs of tech companies, engineers and an actual rocket scientist to explain [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=12.6s)]
*  how they are trying to turn the antiquated federal government into the Apple store. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=19.36s)]
*  This is a revolution and I think it might be the biggest revolution in government since [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=24.92s)]
*  the original revolution. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  But at the end of the day, America is going to be in much better shape. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  What we're trying to do is ensure that people do receive their benefits in the future. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=35.72s)]
*  And you can only receive your benefits if the country is operating in a healthy and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=40.36s)]
*  competent way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=46.22s)]
*  We really believe that the government can have an Apple store-like experience. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=47.22s)]
*  Beautifully designed, great user experience, modern systems. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=51.84s)]
*  That all the retirement stuff is done by, still done by paper in a process that looks [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=55.36000000000001s)]
*  identical to what occurred in the 1950s. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=60.2s)]
*  Like if you took a snapshot of the mine when it first started in the 50s to today, it looks [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=62.2s)]
*  the same. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=66.4s)]
*  Musk and his team there detailing all the wasteful spending that they have been finding. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=67.80000000000001s)]
*  The sheer amount of waste imported into government, it is astonishing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=72.68s)]
*  It's mind-blowing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=76.04s)]
*  700 different IT systems today at NIH. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=77.04s)]
*  700 different IT systems. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=79.68s)]
*  They can't speak to each other. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=81.44s)]
*  We learned 40 percent of the phone calls that they get are from fraudsters. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  40 percent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=87.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=88.72s)]
*  Almost half. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=89.72s)]
*  It's 300 million under the age of 11 and over 300 million to over the age of 120. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=90.72s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=95.92s)]
*  Small business loans, correct? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=96.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=98.92s)]
*  The oldest American is 114. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=99.92s)]
*  So it's safe to say if their age is 115 or above, they're fake. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=102.12s)]
*  Or they should be in the Guinness Book of World Records. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=107.64s)]
*  Those enlightening moments fly in the face of the picture Democrats and the media have [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=110.7s)]
*  been painting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=114.9s)]
*  You may remember how Doge members were called techno-fascists, inexperienced and even a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=115.98s)]
*  goon squad. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=122.14s)]
*  Musk also hitting back against violent attacks on Tesla as more than 200 protests are planned [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=123.62s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=129.16s)]
*  Tesla is a peaceful company that has made great cars, great products. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=130.16s)]
*  That's what it's done. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=135.74s)]
*  It hasn't harmed anyone. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=136.74s)]
*  And yet people are committing violence. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=139.62s)]
*  They're firebombing Tesla dealerships. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=142.06s)]
*  They're shooting guns into stores. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=144.06s)]
*  They're threatening people. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=147.34s)]
*  They're issuing death threats against me and other Tesla personnel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=149.78s)]
*  What are they doing this for? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  And what's happening, it seems to me, is they're being fed propaganda by the far left. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  And they believe it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=165.38s)]
*  It's really unfortunate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=166.62s)]
*  Wow, for so many of us, Jesse, watching this last night, our minds were blown at some of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=168.9s)]
*  these revelations and what they've been able to dig up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=173.9s)]
*  Well, first I thought all these Doge boys were going to be like wearing hoodies and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=176.3s)]
*  have like one hitters hanging from their mouth. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=180.82s)]
*  And they're like really successful innovators that have left their successful companies [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=183.94s)]
*  to take a sabbatical to save the country. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=189.82s)]
*  And all the Democrats can do is heckle. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  They're like bleacher creatures. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=195.70000000000002s)]
*  They're just yelling stuff from the stands. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=198.22s)]
*  They have a hot dog in one hand, a Miller light here, and they're like, you're too slow. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=200.38s)]
*  I mean, meanwhile, these people need like wheelchairs to get out of the stadium. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=204.54s)]
*  They don't have any ideas, the Democrats. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=208.94s)]
*  What's their idea to cut waste, fraud and abuse? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  What's their idea to cut spending? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=213.98s)]
*  This is like when your wife spills wine and then she yells at you because the way you're [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=216.66s)]
*  cleaning it up is wrong. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=222.54s)]
*  Babe, you spilled the wine. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=224.34s)]
*  I'll clean it up the way I want to clean it up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=226.22s)]
*  Why aren't Democrats upset about fraud? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=229.14s)]
*  They're just upset about the way we're finding the fraud. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=232.34s)]
*  Like we're injecting swallows with coke to see if it makes them horny. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=235.54s)]
*  Yes, coke makes everybody horny. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=240.06s)]
*  Why can't we just hold hands and agree if some of this stuff is ridiculous? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=242.98s)]
*  The Democrats don't run their own business like this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=247.06s)]
*  What Democrat business hires people and never fires people? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=250.12s)]
*  What Democrat business just gets built at a million dollars and never stops it? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=254.38s)]
*  What Democrat business gives every employee two credit cards? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=259.42s)]
*  None. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=263.7s)]
*  Democrats never run their own businesses that way, but for some reason tolerate what's going [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=265.06s)]
*  on in the federal government like this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=269.3s)]
*  I would want FEMA to be faster. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=271.3s)]
*  I would want the Pentagon not to get built. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=273.28s)]
*  I would want Medicare and Social Security saved. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=275.58s)]
*  We can agree on that, but for some reason, Democrats are fighting tooth and nail against [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=279.38s)]
*  It's almost like they think the government's theirs. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=284.41999999999996s)]
*  And when any Republican takes power, he's leasing the White House. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=287.7s)]
*  Like if he wants to make any changes, like you have to call the super. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=292.14s)]
*  Like you can't do anything. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=295.82s)]
*  You can't paint it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=297.46s)]
*  You can't irrigate the lawn. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=298.76s)]
*  Anything needs to be done. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  You have to have the Democrats do it for them. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  That's not how we run this country. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=304.34s)]
*  Jessica, you know, the co-founder of Airbnb stuck out in that moment when he was detailing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=306.34s)]
*  the amount of fraud that he has seen since getting in there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=311.62s)]
*  He's obviously in charge of the overhaul of the retirement system for federal workers. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=315.06s)]
*  How could Democrats have any issue with them getting in there and cleaning up these messes? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=319.94s)]
*  If the messes are authentic, then absolutely get in there and clean them up. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=325.82s)]
*  But the Doge that we saw yesterday is not the Doge that's actually been in action. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=330.82s)]
*  So first and foremost, where is Amy Gleason? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=334.9s)]
*  Because Amy Gleason is supposed to be in charge of Doge. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=337.66s)]
*  And I don't know if she's still on vacation in Mexico or what. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=339.9s)]
*  Where's Big Balls? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=342.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=343.02s)]
*  We just got the Airbnb guy and the guy wants to make it into the Apple store. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=344.02s)]
*  But where are the people that we've been reading about for months that are actually in our [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=347.94s)]
*  Social Security payments? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=351.21999999999997s)]
*  There were, I'm sure, some things that they were talking about that are absolutely true. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  40 percent seems really high in terms of the percentage of fraudster calls into Social Security. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=358.62s)]
*  But what Musk and Co. didn't address is that they are closing Social Security offices all [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=364.02s)]
*  over the country and that Republican representatives like Tom Cole from Oklahoma has to call Musk [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=368.5s)]
*  personally to say, please spare my district. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=373.78s)]
*  That means, as Brett said, the 94 year old grandma can't get through to someone, can't [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=376.73999999999995s)]
*  even walk down the street or get in her car, have someone drive her to go in there and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=381.46s)]
*  deal with it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  They threw this insane bit of misinformation, lie, whatever you want to call it, about that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=385.97999999999996s)]
*  survey that cost nearly a billion dollars for the National Park Service. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=392.24s)]
*  So if you looked under the hood a little, what that actually is, and you should be noted [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=396.34000000000003s)]
*  that the entire budget is three million. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=400.3s)]
*  So he is alleging they spent a third of it on the survey that could have been done on [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=401.86s)]
*  Survey Monkey, only 10 questions long. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  So the Interior Department oversees an in-house consulting group for federal agencies for [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  130 million dollars. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=411.74s)]
*  And one of the contracts that they have is for surveys. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=413.26s)]
*  That doesn't mean that's an 830 million dollar survey. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=416.38s)]
*  That means that somewhere within the government, someone is actually running surveys, God forbid. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=419.42s)]
*  He didn't talk about cuts to CDC funding for measles outbreaks, which we're undergoing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=424.22s)]
*  right now in Texas. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=428.22s)]
*  No one seems to care. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=429.22s)]
*  He didn't talk about cuts to HUD. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=430.38000000000005s)]
*  That means that people that are searching for emergency or transitional housing will [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=432.26000000000005s)]
*  be out of a home and be homeless by April 1st. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=437.26000000000005s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=440.38000000000005s)]
*  That's going to really affect veterans in the Hudson Valley. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=441.38000000000005s)]
*  We didn't hear anything about that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=444.70000000000005s)]
*  So yes, it was a beautiful presentation. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=446.1s)]
*  I certainly enjoyed it, but I have many outlying questions. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=447.86s)]
*  Jeff? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=451.3s)]
*  I was wondering where Big Balls was, too. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=452.3s)]
*  Yeah, he was missing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=453.38s)]
*  I've been excited to meet him. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=454.38s)]
*  Me, too. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  How do you know one of them isn't Big Balls? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=456.90000000000003s)]
*  Because Big Balls is 19, I think. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  And those men were of older age. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=459.86s)]
*  Judge, there was already a lot of public support for Doge heading into this. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=462.46000000000004s)]
*  Look, there is tremendous support for this. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=466.18s)]
*  And you know what I love about Jessica and what the Democrats are saying? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=469.46000000000004s)]
*  I heard a Democrat, I think it was a congresswoman, who said, I'm worried that someone's not [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=472.58000000000004s)]
*  going to get a Social Security check. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=477.98s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=480.46000000000004s)]
*  It tells you that they don't have one person who has not yet gotten their Social Security. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=481.82s)]
*  We have one. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=485.97999999999996s)]
*  I have one. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=486.97999999999996s)]
*  Maybe you have one. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  No, no. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=488.97999999999996s)]
*  But let me just finish my point. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=489.97999999999996s)]
*  I didn't interrupt you, Jessica. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=492.97999999999996s)]
*  The truth is that America has never felt better about this country being on the right track. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  And that is because there was so much waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=502.58s)]
*  And you know, Obama talked about it, but didn't do anything about it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=506.38s)]
*  The only people Joe Biden fired were the nurses and the police officers and the people in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=509.86s)]
*  the military who helped us out during COVID. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=515.86s)]
*  But he wanted to fire them because they wouldn't get the vaccine. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=518.9s)]
*  So now that we've got real professionals and we now have a face to Doge, we know what they [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=521.9s)]
*  look like. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=527.74s)]
*  We know who they are. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=528.74s)]
*  They're not in hoodies and they're not, you know, taking coke or they're not, you know, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=529.78s)]
*  doing all the stuff we imagine that the Democrats had us believing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=537.34s)]
*  They are doing a job where they're pointing to facts that the Democrats cannot counter. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=540.34s)]
*  Number one, if you've got 700 different software systems that don't even talk to each other [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=547.34s)]
*  in one National Institute of Health, that is corruption. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=553.7800000000001s)]
*  That is not a fraud. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=558.58s)]
*  That is corruption. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  This is not money that is just going into a garbage can. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=561.7s)]
*  This is money that is going to people illegally. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=565.66s)]
*  There is fraud. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=568.9s)]
*  And the only people complaining about this, stopping or investigating the waste fraud [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=569.9s)]
*  and abuse are the people who want to protect it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=574.82s)]
*  And you know, someone said, you know, the Democrat hires and they never fire. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=577.94s)]
*  Well, that's because they don't have to worry about it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=582.86s)]
*  They get all this money like like Stacey Abrams got $2 billion. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=585.94s)]
*  Who's she going to fire? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=590.14s)]
*  I mean, they just have these foot soldiers that they keep funding. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=591.26s)]
*  And it's about time that we recognize that there are things that they are publishing [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  on a website that anyone can access that shows where the where the fraud and the abuse is. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=600.06s)]
*  Did the doge dudes that Shatter the Democrat narrative? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=606.78s)]
*  I you know, I have to hand it to Brett Baer and Special Report. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=611.18s)]
*  That's like the best thing I've ever seen on this network. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=613.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm I sounds like an exaggeration, but I was sorry, Jesse. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=617.5400000000001s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=621.62s)]
*  Water's World was a great show. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=622.62s)]
*  But if you want to learn how government works and why following the money tells you everything [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=624.98s)]
*  about incentives, self-preservation, fraud, and in this case, patriotism, because all [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=630.38s)]
*  of those guys are not doing it for the money. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=636.58s)]
*  They're doing it for the country. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=639.38s)]
*  I didn't I mean, I'm pretty politically aware. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=640.86s)]
*  I didn't know about that mine in Pennsylvania until Doge. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=642.94s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=647.62s)]
*  That's like, you know, you're living in an apartment and you want to go check on the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=648.62s)]
*  heating. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=651.3000000000001s)]
*  So you get out of the basement and you find an old guy shoveling coal. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=652.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it is not nobody like I'd say 90 90 percent of the population had no idea that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=655.3800000000001s)]
*  existed. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=659.86s)]
*  And now they do. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=660.86s)]
*  Everybody's gone through the list, the Social Security, the computer systems, the Treasury [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=661.86s)]
*  with no oversight on payouts. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=666.3000000000001s)]
*  One point five percent of workers have been fired. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=669.6600000000001s)]
*  You could round that to zero. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=672.52s)]
*  I know it's like somebody, but you're talking a huge number. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=673.88s)]
*  The money being the money being cut from science is being redirected from administrations to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=678.0s)]
*  actual science. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  There's so much stuff there. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=683.48s)]
*  But I wonder why the attacks, the arguments from the Dems and then the violence from their [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=686.08s)]
*  minions. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't think Democrats. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  No, I should say that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=693.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't think leftists are used to people operating from good faith. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=695.9200000000001s)]
*  That a collection of wildly successful people would come together out of pure love for the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=701.56s)]
*  country to save the country from financial ruin. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=705.12s)]
*  So they project their own instincts onto everybody else. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=708.26s)]
*  There must be some ill will that is driving Doge. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=711.64s)]
*  It's got to be greed. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=714.1999999999999s)]
*  These are billionaires. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=715.68s)]
*  They could never fathom an altruistic endeavor. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=716.96s)]
*  And this one is clearly the biggest one in recent history. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=722.0s)]
*  Also, if you're constantly in drama mode, and I would say all of this is drama mode, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=724.76s)]
*  acting instead of doing, then you have to believe there's something underlying this [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=730.52s)]
*  Doge performance. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=736.1999999999999s)]
*  Because if you're an actor, you act all day and you assume everybody else has a false [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=738.6s)]
*  front too. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=742.48s)]
*  So they just assume that there must be something going on with Doge that is covering up a more [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=743.48s)]
*  devious thing. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=749.3199999999999s)]
*  But if you look at the Doge segments, analytical, dry, plainly stated, there were no what ifs. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=751.22s)]
*  There were just what is. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=759.96s)]
*  You know, and the last thing I'll say about the violence, because we haven't touched on [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=762.36s)]
*  that, when somebody does something that you don't like, oftentimes you don't like the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=767.1600000000001s)]
*  person when you should just not like the thing that they did. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=772.96s)]
*  And what the left does is it confuses the two. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=776.84s)]
*  So I could support Doge. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=780.0s)]
*  You could not like the fact that I support Doge, but you shouldn't like, you shouldn't [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=784.26s)]
*  hate me for that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=788.84s)]
*  What you're seeing is people going after the individuals for their beliefs. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=790.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't like that that Elon Musk is fronting Doge, so I don't like him. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=794.0400000000001s)]
*  Generally as human beings, you don't like the act. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=800.76s)]
*  You don't go after the person. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=803.7s)]
*  I believe a famous Christian once said that. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  I think it was hate this, hate this sin and not the sinner. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=808.2s)]
*  Anyway, this is something Doge that both parties, Republicans and Democrats, never would have [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=812.36s)]
*  attempted until somebody named Trump came along and said, why not? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=817.88s)]
*  We're modernizing the government. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=822.52s)]
*  It scares the hell out of the corrupt dinosaurs who can feel the heat of this orange asteroid [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=824.26s)]
*  coming at them. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=829.12s)]
*  And it's Trump. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=830.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=831.28s)]
*  Corrupt dinosaurs. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=832.28s)]
*  Take that, Jessica. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=833.28s)]
*  And orange asteroids. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=834.28s)]
*  And orange... [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=835.28s)]
*  I love today. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=836.28s)]
*  And irrigating the lawn. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=837.28s)]
*  I wanted to go back to that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpoztWl0oE&t=840.04s)]
