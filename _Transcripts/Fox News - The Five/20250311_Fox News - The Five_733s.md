# ‘The Five’: Trump checks out his brand new Tesla
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY)
*  You want my notes? Yeah, they gave me notes. I said, I'm not Biden. I don't need no [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, this is a different panel than I've had everything's computer [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=4.62s)]
*  Think Biden could get into that killer. I like is that one? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=9.76s)]
*  Work that same color. I love Tesla [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=13.92s)]
*  The president and his tech support Donald Trump and Elon Musk turning the White House lawn into a showroom for Tesla after the president made [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=17.0s)]
*  Good on his promise to buy one of the electric cars a show of support for his Doge captain [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=23.64s)]
*  Whose company has become a target of left-wing violent protests watch I? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=28.28s)]
*  Think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=33.88s)]
*  And I just want people to know that you can't be penalized for being a patriot [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  And he's a great patriot in the time. I've known him [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=43.92s)]
*  He has never asked me for a favor. He didn't ask me for this. I said, you know, we learn [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=47.44s)]
*  I don't like what's happening to you. This man is a great patriot and you should cherish him [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=52.2s)]
*  You should cherish him. You know, I have a little statement [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=58.6s)]
*  We have to take care of our high IQ people because we don't have too many of them [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=60.88s)]
*  Judge this is a show of friendship and loyalty [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=65.84s)]
*  Loyalty goes both ways and this was a real public showing of this is a good car. This is a good man [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=69.36s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's very it's very Donald Trump. I mean from from the beginning [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=74.48s)]
*  I mean if he could help someone he will do it and you know, there's no question. Look, Elon Musk is not in politics [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=79.28s)]
*  He's not used to this. I mean, you know, he's in the business world, but I mean he is despised [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=85.76s)]
*  They are they are you know throwing Molotov cocktails into parking lots [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=91.12s)]
*  He's lost billions because he's not able to really focus on his own business. So he's suffering a lot [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=96.52s)]
*  He's taking a lot of attacks suffering financially. He's physically exhausted. I mean, he hasn't stopped [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=102.84s)]
*  So, you know the president is like, you know say doing him a solid and saying look, you know [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=108.56s)]
*  This guy is helping us look Doge is very important to this government and to what the president is trying to do [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  To the economy that was totally destroyed by Joe Biden. I mean we've got this two trillion dollar yearly deficit [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=119.56s)]
*  And I keep hearing people say that the the interest rate is higher than our Department of Defense [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  Spending and so, you know, we're in a bit of a and a bit of a tough crime a tough time economically and and you know [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=133.12s)]
*  Elon Musk is doing everything he can to help the president [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=140.88s)]
*  One thing that I thought earlier today was that if I were them I would keep the focus more on Biden [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=143.88s)]
*  For a little while right you can ride that a little bit because you inherited this situation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  He went back to it a little bit today, but just as a reminder of what people had [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=154.76s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think I think because you're talking about a transition [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=163.44s)]
*  and I think the media is trying to paint this as a shock to the system and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=163.92s)]
*  What Trump is doing is trying to remind you what was there before and it and you would think that like Democrats would go for this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=169.32s)]
*  Because they love a good transition [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=176.66s)]
*  However, this one it just isn't absurd enough for their liking, you know [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  They're good with little boys turn him into little girls fossil fuels, you know into wind power [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=183.48s)]
*  Red meat no eat insects [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  All of those transitions are categorically insane [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=191.48s)]
*  But here is actually a practical real transition where you're taking a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  System that is corrupt and wasteful and you're trying to make it better. And what do they do? We need to set fire [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=199.16s)]
*  with Tesla dealer dealerships and and the judge is right like they're also [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=205.52s)]
*  Claiming that somehow Musk is in this for himself [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=211.04s)]
*  This guy's risking the bankruptcy of his company to prevent the bankruptcy of his country and the media is again [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=214.12s)]
*  Choosing the wrong path. I think it's almost a parallel [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  To what they did with the cover-up of Biden when they covered up Biden that was to make the Dems look better and bad for Trump [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  Then they try to destroy Elon [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=233.52s)]
*  So the Dems look better and it's bad for Trump, but they always shift this codependent alliance against something that is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=235.44s)]
*  Positive for the country because if it's positive for the country, it doesn't help the Democrats [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=244.16s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump also answered some questions on the recent turmoil in the stock market [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Of course, there are fears of recession and tariffs. Let's listen [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Think we're our country had to do this. We had to go and do this. They've taken away other [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=259.32s)]
*  Countries have taken away our business. They've taken away our jobs [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=265.12s)]
*  Drops and markets are gonna go up and they're gonna go down [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=268.8s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=271.78000000000003s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  We have to rebuild our country our country has been stripped of its jobs of its factories and I'm very optimistic [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=273.04s)]
*  I have to tell you I'm very optimistic about [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  The country much more optimistic this way than if I did it the easy way [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=282.08s)]
*  Yeah, I could have done it the easy way. I could have caused it Biden left us a mess right now [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=286.56s)]
*  We're like a chicken that's being plucked at from all over the world. We're not gonna let that happen anymore [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=291.88s)]
*  I think there will be a recession. I don't see it at all. I think this country is gonna boom [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=296.56s)]
*  I think we're gonna have an economy that's a real economy. Not a fake economy. The chicken analogy was a good one [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=301.68s)]
*  Yeah, and egg prices are down Jessica. How'd that happen? Oh, I guess we stopped slaughtering all of the chickens [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  Stocks were pretty good under Joe Biden because he slept all day market loves certainty [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  He made no news took no action and the market took off and that's fine [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=321.42s)]
*  But it didn't help the American worker one bit American worker got crushed by migrants and inflation [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=326.44000000000005s)]
*  And that's why Trump was elected to come in and fix that to help Main Street not Wall Street Wall Street's gonna be fine [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=332.5s)]
*  Wall Street's always fine, especially during globalization and that was good [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=339.38s)]
*  You know, we had a lot of multinational companies in this country do very well stock market was roaring prices were low [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  But there was also a downside. We lost a hundred thousand [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=351.02s)]
*  manufacturing plants [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  millions of jobs [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=357.06s)]
*  But there was something more the fabric of the nation was destroyed because what does it mean when you lose a job if you're a man [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=358.94s)]
*  Maybe you lose your wife. Maybe you turn to drugs [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=367.46s)]
*  these towns in middle America were ripped apart and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=370.53999999999996s)]
*  That's why Trump was elected in 2016 and he did make a lot of progress there [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=375.34s)]
*  But then kovat hit and we realized that we needed to get these supply chains back [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=380.06s)]
*  Domestically because it's an issue of national security [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=385.88s)]
*  So that's what he's trying to do and the market does not like the uncertainty and I understand that it's unpredictable [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=388.76s)]
*  But the goal is to bring key [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=394.68s)]
*  Supply chains back to this country and use tariffs the same way Nixon did Reagan did Bush did to restore the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=397.08s)]
*  Manufacturing base in this country. So we have steel to make ships so we can make medicine [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=405.68s)]
*  So we make automobiles here and we have good-paying jobs that boost wages and we control the border [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=410.72s)]
*  We stop government spending that reduces inflation and that's what you call a real economy and these are tough decisions [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=417.88000000000005s)]
*  He's making and he's making them because he's not running for reelection. She doesn't care about the politics [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=425.32000000000005s)]
*  He's doing tough stuff that politicians usually don't do because it's unpopular [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=430.6s)]
*  But it's in the long term interest of the American economy [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=435.76000000000005s)]
*  Jessica, what do you think of that? It was beautiful. It was largely inaccurate, but it was a beautiful one [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=439.88s)]
*  All of it name one part that your wife leaves you if you lose your job [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a pretty crappy marriage. Have you seen what happened to the Heartland? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=451.64000000000004s)]
*  They're all single dudes now and the unemployment levels. Okay. It's why Obama [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=455.44s)]
*  Was such a bad president. He had to bring Trump in to fix it. Okay [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=460.68s)]
*  So if Trump was thinking about [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=465.52s)]
*  The future the beautiful future of the country then he would be looking at that spending bill that Mike Johnson put forward [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=468.4s)]
*  Just add what seven trillion to the deficit and he'd be saying well, maybe we shouldn't do that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=474.4s)]
*  Maybe my friends don't need a tax cut. Maybe this should be more evenly distributed [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=478.48s)]
*  Maybe we should help out the little guy and give them a tax cut [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=482.0s)]
*  Instead of the people who paid to get me in there and you say he's doing Elon Musk a solid Elon Musk spent [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=486.03999999999996s)]
*  $290 million to get him elected. He owes Elon Musk that car commercial, which maybe it's an ethics violation [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=491.0s)]
*  Even the strongest allies of the president don't like these tariffs [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=497.32s)]
*  They might think it's possible to use them smaller levels 5% 10% [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=502.4s)]
*  But the tariff whiplash is destroying us [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=507.0s)]
*  You look at the market tanking and I thought Peter Doocy had a great point earlier on today our very own Peter Doocy where he said [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  They want federal workers to take the buyout they want them to retire but they're sinking their retirement accounts and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  Caroline Levitt is standing up there at the podium and she's just either [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=521.96s)]
*  She doesn't know how a tariff works or she's lying to the people [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=526.04s)]
*  She said tariffs are tax hike on foreign countries and a tax cut for the American people and then a reporter I think from the AP [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=529.04s)]
*  So they got back in the room said have you ever paid a tariff? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=535.76s)]
*  I have they don't get charged on foreign countries and then she went Trumpian. She goes I'm sorry [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddpJh8kQLY&t=538.64s)]
