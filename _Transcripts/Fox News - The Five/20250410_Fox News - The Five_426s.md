# Gutfeld: The contrast between Elon Musk and Tim Walz could not be starker
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek)
*  We're excited to announce that we anticipate savings in FY26 from reduction of waste and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=0.0s)]
*  fraud by $150 billion. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=5.96s)]
*  If you ask me, like, well, how are you going to find wasting forward in the government? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=6.96s)]
*  I'm like, well, actually just go in any direction. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=11.8s)]
*  That's how you find it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=14.84s)]
*  People are fantastic. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=15.84s)]
*  In fact, hopefully they'll stay around for the long haul. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=16.84s)]
*  Elon Musk touting some big savings by Team Doge as Democrats attempt to terminate Trump's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=20.48s)]
*  tech support Axios reporting saying that a group of House Democrats who are launching [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=24.68s)]
*  a concerted campaign to force Elon Musk out of the Trump administration by May 30th, they're [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=30.32s)]
*  betting the farm on a legal technicality that Elon's special government employee status [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=34.84s)]
*  can't go beyond 130 days. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  But that might not sit well with Tim Walz. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=41.96s)]
*  He's been making the world's richest man a big target at his own town halls. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=44.4s)]
*  My beef is, once you get successful, don't be a greedy bastard and not pay your taxes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=48.16s)]
*  I don't think we should be the party that demonizes someone because they're able to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=55.16s)]
*  afford something or they're able to work hard and got something. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  What we should demonize is people like Elon Musk and those people that do that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  That's different. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=67.96s)]
*  This guy needs to exit stage left. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=69.96s)]
*  And I do mean left. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  Greg, it's kind of hilarious that Democrats are using some of their very limited political [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  capital to force Elon out of a White House job that he's already limited in having beyond [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=78.82s)]
*  May 30th anyway. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=85.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a contrast in men. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=86.82s)]
*  When you look at, when you see Musk and you see Walz, one is a drama queen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=92.69999999999999s)]
*  The other one makes things. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=97.94s)]
*  One is a theater kid. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=100.06s)]
*  The other one builds theaters. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=101.22s)]
*  One guy just shoots his mouth off. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=103.3s)]
*  The other guy shoots rockets into space that come down and land. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=105.33999999999999s)]
*  One guy demonizes risk takers while the other guy helps the paralyzed walk. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=108.78s)]
*  Who is the public servant? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=113.66s)]
*  Who is the public servant? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=115.58s)]
*  The governor, the governor, the governor of Minnesota, you know, this pudgy, cosplaying [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=116.78s)]
*  cuckoo clown, this discount, Rick Taylor. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=123.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=127.38s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  Maybe Tim means that demonizing is a good thing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=131.22s)]
*  Didn't he allow Satanists to erect a statue in the capital of Minnesota? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=134.74s)]
*  Didn't his wife say the smell of burning Minneapolis? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  She missed that smell. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=144.26s)]
*  Maybe they believe that hell is heaven and demonizing is a good thing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=145.54s)]
*  Also, doesn't Elon Musk pay taxes? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=149.38s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=151.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think he does pay taxes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=153.14s)]
*  Yeah, and he has the money to pay it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=154.54s)]
*  I love that this is being pushed by this Congressman, Greg Kassar. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=156.78s)]
*  He is a member, you might remember, Jesse. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=160.78s)]
*  He did the food and hunger strike on the Capitol that lasted eight hours. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=162.42s)]
*  So basically, he ate breakfast at nine, skipped lunch, and then had dinner. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  Anyone who does a hunger strike, I'm against. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=170.82s)]
*  Unless it's the View. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  That's a diet. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  That's different. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  You know, the first family doesn't pay their taxes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  Democrats never cared. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  This guy probably pays billions of dollars into the Treasury. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=188.14s)]
*  And what do these people do with it? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=191.98s)]
*  They spend it on Sesame Street in Iraq. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=193.66s)]
*  And it's not demonizing somebody to tell them to get back to work. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=196.78s)]
*  That's not demonization. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=201.78s)]
*  That's just saying, go back to work. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=203.1s)]
*  Now Democrats are just mad at everything Donald Trump's doing that they never did. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  It's like if I claimed that we got to clean the garage and I complained about the messy [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  garage for years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=218.98s)]
*  And then Emma finally cleans the garage. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=220.7s)]
*  And I said, God damn it, Emma. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=222.42s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  This garage. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  You didn't do it right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  Wow, that would be a fight. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  Can I just piggyback quickly? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  Musk was going to get like a what, $50 billion bonus and the Democrats stopped it in Delaware. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  If he had gotten that bonus, half of that would have gone to the government. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=237.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  And they could have lots of Sesame Street in Iraq with it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  I think one of the problems, Jessica, for the ticket last time around Harrison and Walz [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=244.33999999999997s)]
*  is that they were two people who had never worked in the private sector, like creating [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=248.58s)]
*  jobs. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=252.3s)]
*  And it does make a difference, I think, to your mindset. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=253.3s)]
*  There is definitely an appetite across political ideologies for people that are effective in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=256.66s)]
*  governing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=265.14s)]
*  However that works, I think a governor will have a very good shot in the 2028 primary. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=266.14s)]
*  We love governors and business people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=270.74s)]
*  Obviously, that's something, you know, it comes up every time where people say about [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=272.86s)]
*  Donald Trump, he's a businessman, he knows how to do this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=276.5s)]
*  And he came in saying, like, you should put me in charge because I'm the one who actually [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=278.98s)]
*  knows how to exploit all of these loopholes because I've been doing it my entire life [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=282.54s)]
*  and continues to actually from the White House. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=286.86s)]
*  But, you know, I'm Elon Musk torn about this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=289.46s)]
*  So he is a special government employee. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=293.46s)]
*  He's going to be out. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=294.98s)]
*  His businesses are in a bit of crisis. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=295.98s)]
*  Tesla in particular, he wants a free trade zone in Europe, which is obviously diametrically [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=297.98s)]
*  opposed to what the government is doing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=303.7s)]
*  He has a approval rating. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=305.12s)]
*  He's 19 points underwater. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=306.8s)]
*  And he is also the main motivating force for Democrats to turn out now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=308.3s)]
*  So you want him to stay? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=312.76s)]
*  Torn, torn, honestly. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=314.56s)]
*  It's nice to have the enthusiasm when you look at these over performances. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=316.8s)]
*  But just before we might have to do a little bit of breaking news, Judge, one of the reasons [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=319.72s)]
*  that Elon Musk's companies are in trouble is because he was willing to help the government [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=324.8s)]
*  and the people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=330.08s)]
*  Yes, to find out where the waste, fraud and abuse was. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=331.08s)]
*  And we found out that, you know, not only DEI and not only the USAID sending money for [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  the, you know, all these crazy shows. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=339.76s)]
*  But we found out that there are people who are between the ages of one and four are getting [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=343.44s)]
*  Social Security, that we've got something like 69 million dollars in taxpayers. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=348.0s)]
*  That's the benefit for kids whose parents are dead. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=352.68s)]
*  Let me just finish. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=354.92s)]
*  But the problem is this, that the Democrats demand a full statement that Elon Musk is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=355.92s)]
*  going to be gone. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=361.16s)]
*  If I had a Tesla, I would put it in the garage because we don't know if those 130 days have [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  to be consecutive. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  And what if he decides 130 days is not May 30th? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=369.68s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=373.36s)]
*  Number two, for Waltz to say that Elon is a greedy bastard. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=374.48s)]
*  This is a guy who dumped his battalion before they were about to be deployed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=379.76000000000005s)]
*  This is a guy who went to China. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I wonder if he paid taxes on the money made when he was teaching in China because [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=386.12s)]
*  he keep going back. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTttOnhyvek&t=390.44000000000005s)]
