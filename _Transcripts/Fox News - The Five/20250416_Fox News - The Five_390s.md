# Jesse Watters: Biden was let out for a night unsupervised
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng)
*  Dr. Jill letting Joe out for a night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=0.0s)]
*  Unsupervised, former president Joe Biden whispering, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=3.04s)]
*  shouting and making shocking racial gaffes during his first public speech since [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=6.16s)]
*  peacing out of the White House. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=10.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=13.6s)]
*  It's never been this divided. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=19.76s)]
*  Granted it's roughly 30 percent but it's a 30 percent that has no heart. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=24.48s)]
*  That's what the that's what the legislation is about. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=28.96s)]
*  It's about dignity. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=32.4s)]
*  Simple dignity. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=36.8s)]
*  Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=38.4s)]
*  I'd never seen hardly any black people scranton at the time when I was and I was only going on [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=41.36s)]
*  fourth grade and I remember seeing the kids going by at the time called colored kids on a bus going by. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=46.88s)]
*  Hi. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=53.12s)]
*  Harold does that bother you when he says colored kids like that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=56.0s)]
*  No because he was saying that's what they were called. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean in fairness I think that's that's that is what unfortunately we have an ugly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  history in our country around it but he like I said yesterday I respect the daylights out of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=65.44s)]
*  him. I appreciate with a great deal of gratitude the enormous amount of service he gave our country [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=70.8s)]
*  including serving as president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=75.92s)]
*  He lost children and while while in office he lost his wife. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=77.6s)]
*  He has suffered a lot and gave a lot but I think when he's talking about these issues [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=83.12s)]
*  it signals and maybe suggests to the country that Democrats have run out of leadership or run out [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=88.72s)]
*  of ideas or run out of people to offer these things as much as I he has every right to say [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=93.2s)]
*  these things I don't think it serves the body politic for Democrats for him to be a face and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=97.04s)]
*  a voice for the party right now and I wish him well and I hope that he decides to take a seat [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=103.12s)]
*  for a while and let some new voices emerge. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=108.64s)]
*  Dana he'd laid low for a while and this was the big public speech we were all waiting for. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=110.8s)]
*  How do you think it went? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=115.36s)]
*  Not great I would say not great. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=116.72s)]
*  It's in it might be Easter week but Christmas came early for the Trump White House because [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=119.12s)]
*  the fact that this is something that we are leading or not leading what we have we have it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=123.6s)]
*  at the top of our show on the five and it's the second day in a row that we're talking about Joe [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=127.2s)]
*  Biden that can't be helpful to the Democrats. You got Van Hollen headed to El Salvador and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=132.0s)]
*  Biden giving a speech I mean what's next Cory Booker is going to give another 25 hour speech [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=137.84s)]
*  that nobody remembers. President Biden would probably be better off saying nothing going home [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=142.0s)]
*  and being quiet and not reminding everybody about one all the things that we're having to deal with [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=151.44s)]
*  now like letting all the illegals in and then having to do do process one by one in order to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=156.56s)]
*  get them out. I think Rachel Moran's mom talked very passionately about why that matters and that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=162.16s)]
*  the long-term effect of this of what it could be what moms and dads across the country could face [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  if we don't get the criminals out. So I think Biden as a I don't really care what Biden does [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=176.64s)]
*  necessarily but my advice would be if you actually want your poll numbers to go up and your name to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=182.16s)]
*  have some sort of reputational rehabilitation I would go home. You know Greg these are private [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=187.04s)]
*  speeches he's getting paid you don't have to let cameras in. Yeah he wanted these cameras in. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=193.44s)]
*  Yeah between Van Hollen and Biden I feel like this is Ask Wednesday. My guess is that he he [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=198.64s)]
*  booked this this was booked probably a year in advance before the Dems knew he was totally [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=205.68s)]
*  brain dead. He actually spoke before advocates for people with disabilities and after the speech [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=209.92s)]
*  they were like wow even we can't help him. It was really bad although it was a relief when he spoke [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=216.08s)]
*  over Bruce Springsteen because he sounds terrible but he was what got me was when he was talking [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  about division in this country. That's like the view coming out against Pi. He fomented division [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=226.08s)]
*  with his relentless pushing of the fine people hoax. He portrayed Trump voters as dark and evil [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=233.28s)]
*  white supremacists any chance he got. He fostered a cult of identity politics that even within the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=238.96s)]
*  Democratic Party pit group against group. I mean what's what can Joe come out against next. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=244.16s)]
*  Nepotism. Try that one you turd. It's the same by the way he tells the same stories over and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=249.2s)]
*  over again. It's not just the words that he uses it's the stories and the narrative is white people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=255.76s)]
*  are racist except for me. You know even when I was a child I was so enlightened and I was so brave [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=262.64s)]
*  but we all know it was BS because whenever he's off the cup he says commonly bigoted things about [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=271.76s)]
*  Indian people. He's it is just amazing. I want him to keep going. I want him to keep going. Go Joe. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=276.96s)]
*  He's not going to stop judge. He's going to be out speaking the whole year. Okay let me ask you a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=285.44s)]
*  question. Who is the only person the one person who has something to gain by Joe Biden going out [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=290.96s)]
*  there? Party doesn't want him. They want him off you know and and that nobody wants him center stage. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=298.96s)]
*  It's Jill okay and you know the idea that he would actually come out and speak to a group of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  to say about disabilities is just rich but but to come to something a little more substantive [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  he slammed President Trump about Social Security. He said the President was plotting to cut and gut [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  Social Security. The 30 percent of the country has no heart. That's us of course which is you know a [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=326.4s)]
*  duplication of his soul of you know the soul of America's speech with the military guys in the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=332.56s)]
*  dark red behind him when he gave that speech where he said we're all mega extremists. The amazing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=338.64s)]
*  part of it is that it was Joe Biden who saw the biggest increase in the number of immigrants [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=344.0s)]
*  given Social Security numbers. More than two million immigrants given Social Security numbers [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=350.64s)]
*  illegals in 2024 and that doesn't even touch the destruction that he did to Medicaid which [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=358.08s)]
*  allows virtually all illegals to get Medicaid and he's turning it around and saying that Donald [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=364.96s)]
*  Trump is going to cut it. He's such a liar. Donald Trump's going to cut taxes on Social Security. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  Maybe that's what he was confused about. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wRs-HELJng&t=375.6s)]
