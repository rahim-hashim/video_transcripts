# ‘The Five’: ‘Living LEGEND’ Elon Musk leaves his mark on DC
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg)
*  Hi I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Ebele Campagno, Jessica Tarlov, Jesse Waters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=0.0s)]
*  and she wants to be buried in a hot dog bun. Dana Perino, The Five. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy. What do you think of my hat? I wear a lot of hats. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I thought my son might enjoy this but he's sticking his fingers in my ears. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=24.44s)]
*  There's a couple tech support here. Who's big balls? That should be obvious. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=28.08s)]
*  The Doge Daddy is gone and done. Elon Musk announcing his departure from DC and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=36.56s)]
*  thanking President Trump with an announcement on X where he said quote [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=42.32s)]
*  the Doge mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=45.28s)]
*  throughout the government. Musk saving over a hundred and seventy five billion [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  dollars since the start of Trump's term and is getting honest about seeing that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=53.2s)]
*  mission continue. I was like disappointed to see the massive spending bill frankly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=57.4s)]
*  which increases the budget deficit not this decrease it and it reminds the work [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=65.16s)]
*  that the Doge team is doing. Musk learning a few lessons from his time in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=70.36s)]
*  the swamp. He told the Washington Post quote the federal bureaucracy situation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=74.28s)]
*  is much worse than I realized. The billionaire also lamenting how Doge [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=78.44s)]
*  became DC's whipping boy after the left turned on him and started torching [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=82.32s)]
*  Teslas but now the Dems are left without their favorite scapegoat. When [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=86.24s)]
*  Trump came in and Doge and Elon Musk began firing key safety officials for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  the FAA began laying off key personnel. One of the biggest issues right now is a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=96.44s)]
*  personnel issue in addition to the technology issues. Trump and Musk are [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  just eroding the American dream. They're rigging the system for billionaires [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=105.52s)]
*  while stealing from the elderly from the disabled to cut taxes for their [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  billionaire club. They are dead now at the hands of Elon Musk and his co-conspirators. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=118.0s)]
*  So Jessica we know that if the debt is not addressed within the next few years [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=125.2s)]
*  we will probably face an economic collapse. Some will call it an economic [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=131.08s)]
*  heart attack. We'll have a weak dollar hyperinflation rising interest rates [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=136.72s)]
*  and yet it was sobering to watch the Democrats root against Musk and Doge [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=142.44s)]
*  when they know that if he fails there will be economic collapse. So I ask you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=147.84s)]
*  what is a Democrat solution for this coming crisis? If you if you weren't fine [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=152.76s)]
*  with Doge or Elon Musk what is your solution young lady if I may call you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=158.76s)]
*  that? I mean I'm 41 but I like to think of myself as young. Our solution is a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=163.52s)]
*  Democratic redux from the 90s where you have a Doge master and it could be Elon [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=170.04s)]
*  Musk that gets together and works at the administration and also works with [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=174.72s)]
*  Congress and does all of this the legal way. Why was this one wrong? Well because he took the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=178.48s)]
*  proverbial chainsaw then a lot of times the courts had to overrule him and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=183.72s)]
*  frankly the GOP wasn't interested in codifying any of his cuts that's the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=187.44s)]
*  problem. They're wrong for that but I'm asking you what was wrong [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=191.76s)]
*  with what he did? Well because he wasn't paying attention to what he was cutting which is why they had to reinstate all these people from the folks who [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=196.8s)]
*  were for the weather services to the nuclear scientists just kind of woke up [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=204.52s)]
*  and started slashing things or sent baby big balls out there and they didn't know [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  what they were doing and it's gonna turn out that only nine billion dollars of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=211.68s)]
*  the hundred and seventy five billion that he originally touted which was [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=215.72000000000003s)]
*  supposed to be two trillion are actually going to be in this reconciliation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  package and what the Democrats are arguing and what I think you couldn't [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=222.12s)]
*  deny is that it's reckless at this moment to ram through trillions of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=225.72s)]
*  dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy when you haven't cut any of the spending [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=228.84s)]
*  which is why Ron Johnson right now is a no, Rand Paul is a no and they don't have [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=232.68s)]
*  the numbers for this and I'm not saying that the Democrats are gonna get Elon [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=237.32s)]
*  Musk back right here but he's so clearly disappointed talking about the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=240.24s)]
*  reconciliation bill and the work that he's done and also Tesla's out there [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=245.32s)]
*  now tweeting saying you can't do these cuts that get rid of the energy tax [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=248.76s)]
*  incentives because we're gonna the grid is going to be smashed as a result of it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  and we're gonna lose our energy independence so I'm campaigning for you [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Elon we only talked for a little while when you were on the show but I will [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=261.32s)]
*  take you back and we could doge the right way together. So it was just not the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=265.56s)]
*  right way the process was wrong but they were 100% behind it guys [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=269.36s)]
*  what say you Jesse? You know Jessica's laughing that he's gone but it's like [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=273.4s)]

*  kind of thinking that is so destructive instead of saying we do care because [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=529.22s)]
*  it's death by a thousand cuts because economic catastrophe is the next logical [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=532.7s)]

*  so automatically ascribing value when the reality was all of that bloat all of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=553.98s)]
*  it needed to be bloat needed to be exploded and the only person that could [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=559.14s)]
*  do it was him through the algorithms that's what speaker Johnson said today [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=562.7s)]
*  he said the bureaucracy was hiding it that's why you can't do it the legal [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=565.5s)]
*  boring way yeah I did say legal though which we should aspire yeah Dana I do [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=569.4200000000001s)]
*  find it I I think the thing that bugs me the most about it is he was doing [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=576.3000000000001s)]
*  something that was widely popular among the American public and still is and yet [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=580.58s)]
*  the Democrats and the media attacked him for it it's like you talk about public [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=585.82s)]
*  service he's not a politician he did he didn't have to do this I absolutely [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=590.9000000000001s)]
*  think that the long-term legacy of Elon Musk in this period of his life and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=594.46s)]
*  maybe forever will be complicated because he one thing that is wonderful [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=598.82s)]
*  is to go back to actually being willing to have this conversation about [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=604.7s)]
*  overspending right like we're having the conversation we're just not getting [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=608.14s)]
*  to the solutions but we're getting to the root of it which is that because [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=611.38s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats will not deal with the long-term problems of the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=614.98s)]
*  entitlement programs and just making them work better right I'm not talking [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=621.34s)]
*  about cutting anyone's benefits but making them work better for the people [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=627.34s)]
*  who deserve it until we're willing to deal with that it like Stephen Miller [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=630.54s)]
*  the other day when he posted that there's discretionary spending and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=634.42s)]
*  there's non-discretionary spending you can't do anything about this well if you [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=637.26s)]
*  wall off that part of the budget then you're never going to get right but I [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=640.14s)]
*  do think they can keep Doge going in a way well they're going to with Russ vote [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=643.34s)]
*  over at the Office of Management and Budget one of the things we haven't [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=646.74s)]
*  talked about a lot is that I know that the money fell short of the waste fraud [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=650.46s)]
*  and abuse that they said they could find but improving the technology at a lot of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=654.78s)]
*  these places would be amazing yeah remember the computers were that were [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=660.5s)]
*  like green had a green screen like that's the kind of stuff that some of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=663.46s)]
*  the agencies were still using that is extremely useful and I think an exciting [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=666.34s)]
*  thing but I also feel like for Musk he I like what John Eckdahl said on X he said [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=671.38s)]
*  that musk really went through this Republican Party experience you have [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=675.82s)]
*  this euphoric victory you have grand sweeping plans you complete governing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=678.7s)]
*  incompetence and then you have political disillusionment you're like yeah that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=683.9s)]
*  wasn't so great and he's right it can be big it can be beautiful he doesn't know [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=688.12s)]
*  if it can be both at the same time it will get done but until we as a country [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=691.94s)]
*  actually deal with the non-discretionary issue we will not be able to reduce the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Rt57qSZLg&t=696.14s)]
