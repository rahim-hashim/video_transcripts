# Trump plays the media like a cat with a ball of yarn: Greg Gutfeld
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A)
*  Well, it was fun while it lasted, but President Trump's putting to bed his favorite way to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=0.0s)]
*  drive Libs crazy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=4.96s)]
*  The Trump Organization is selling hats that say Trump 2028. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=7.88s)]
*  Are you seriously considering a third term? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=13.16s)]
*  It's something that to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=16.26s)]
*  I don't know if that's constitutional that they're not allowing you to do it or anything [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=19.92s)]
*  else, but there are many people selling the 2028 hat, but this is not something I'm looking [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=23.68s)]
*  to do. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=29.78s)]
*  I think we're going to have four years, and I think four years is plenty of time to do [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=30.78s)]
*  something really spectacular. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=33.34s)]
*  But when one media hoax dies, another one gets its wings. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=35.74s)]
*  The press is twisting President Trump's I don't know comment to make it seem like he's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=39.22s)]
*  unsure about upholding the Constitution, conveniently leaving out the full context of what he said [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=43.32s)]
*  in this NBC interview. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=48.58s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=50.46s)]
*  Your secretary of state says everyone who's here, citizens and non-citizens, deserve due [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=51.7s)]
*  process. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=55.82s)]
*  Do you agree, Mr. President? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=56.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=57.82s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=58.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=60.02s)]
*  Well, the Fifth Amendment says it's not. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=61.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=63.02s)]
*  It seems it might say that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=64.02s)]
*  But if you're talking about that, then we'd have to have a million or two million or three [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=65.78s)]
*  million trials. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=69.54s)]
*  Don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States, Mr. President? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=71.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=73.58s)]
*  I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=75.18s)]
*  are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=81.62s)]
*  What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=85.4s)]
*  They have a different interpretation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=88.74s)]
*  Well, he's not a lawyer, Judge Sinead, and that's why we elected him president. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=91.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=95.74s)]
*  A couple of thoughts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  She says that the Fifth Amendment requires it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  So of course I pull out, I carry this in my purse all the time. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=101.58s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=104.5s)]
*  I think someday I'll be arrested or something. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=105.5s)]
*  I'll take it out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=106.9s)]
*  Fifth Amendment is about a grand jury. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=107.9s)]
*  It's about double jeopardy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=110.22s)]
*  It's about a person not being compelled to be a witness against himself. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=112.02000000000001s)]
*  And you cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  It says nothing about illegals. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  So cut the crap, Kristen Welker. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=121.16s)]
*  You're a good person, but you're wrong on this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Now, the question as to whether or not, third term, we all know. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  He made it very clear. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  He said, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=132.2s)]
*  End of this story. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=136.48s)]
*  But they can't. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=137.82s)]
*  They're all about imagination, fascination. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=138.82s)]
*  Maybe you will, maybe you won't. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=141.44s)]
*  But then on this whole thing of Abrego Garcia, I went back and I read the Supreme Court [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=143.3s)]
*  decision again. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=147.66s)]
*  They are interpreting it when she said, isn't he entitled to due process? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=149.1s)]
*  Abrego Garcia was entitled, according to the Supreme Court, to be facilitated in his return [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=153.1s)]
*  only because there was a withholding order and he shouldn't have been deported because [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=160.02s)]
*  of the withholding order. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=165.26s)]
*  OK, because he's MS-13 and they'll kill him with the other gang. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=166.74s)]
*  So let's be clear about this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=171.82s)]
*  The Supreme Court never said in Abrego Garcia case that due process is required for illegals. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=173.2s)]
*  Can they get an immigration hearing? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=179.56s)]
*  Probably, but that doesn't mean they go to court and we can't possibly do a 20 million. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=181.44s)]
*  We can't even get through trials in this country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  And sweetie trial is a reason a lot of defendants get out of jail because we can't even give [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=189.16s)]
*  the citizens trials. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=194.56s)]
*  The I don't know hoax, Greg. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=196.72s)]
*  Do you think this has legs? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=201.62s)]
*  Trump is the cat and the media is just a ball of yarn. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  And it's refreshing to see because for the longest time we were the ball of yarn and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  the media was always poking and tugging and unraveling us for decades. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump represents us. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=216.66000000000003s)]
*  Now our guys flip the script and you get no sympathy from me. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=217.74s)]
*  He likes playing with them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=220.8s)]
*  For example, you know, it's very clever about the about writing again. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=221.8s)]
*  He doesn't have to run for a third term. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  He else runs for a third term with him as VP. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=227.94s)]
*  The person president resigns. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=231.84s)]
*  He's president. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=234.0s)]
*  Then the fourth term. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=235.0s)]
*  Then the fourth term happens again. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=237.0s)]
*  This time the advance goes, no, I'm going to stay. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=239.12s)]
*  If I'm elected, I'm going to stay. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=241.92s)]
*  They get in and he goes, oh, I have a heart ailment. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=242.92s)]
*  Resign. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=245.36s)]
*  Trump again. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=246.36s)]
*  That's four terms. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=247.36s)]
*  Four terms. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=248.36s)]
*  He triggers these guys more than the NRA. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=249.36s)]
*  I feel like the media is like a junkie who doesn't know they've hit rock bottom yet. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=252.9s)]
*  And Trump is just showing them every day. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=258.38s)]
*  So maybe they can start over. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=260.76s)]
*  He's basically pulling a one man intervention saying, you guys, nobody trusts you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=262.46s)]
*  Nobody likes you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=268.12s)]
*  Why don't you give it up? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=269.68s)]
*  Start over. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=271.6s)]
*  Move to a new town. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=272.6s)]
*  Speaking of third terms, Dana, that is an interesting idea, Greg. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=274.1s)]
*  I think you should run that up the flagpole. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=277.58s)]
*  I will. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=279.26s)]
*  I think he just did. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=280.26s)]
*  He was asked about his successor. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=282.2s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=284.68s)]
*  I think we have tremendous people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=285.68s)]
*  I think we have a tremendous group of people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=288.48s)]
*  We talked about a number of them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=291.08s)]
*  You look at Marco, you look at JD Vance, who's fantastic. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  You look at, I could name 10, 15, 20 people right now just sitting here. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=296.64s)]
*  No, I think we have a tremendous party. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=301.2s)]
*  So he name checked Marco and JD. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=303.8s)]
*  So I thought this was very, very interesting because one, I think it's good for him to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  put to bed the idea of the third term and just like let it go. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=310.56s)]
*  And if the media continues to run with it, you can make fun of them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=313.22s)]
*  But I think that is settled. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=316.26s)]
*  The fact that he said there could be 15 to 20 people who run, that was his first response. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=317.9s)]
*  So you have an open primary on both sides. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=323.42s)]
*  Imagine the stages for these debates, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=326.0s)]
*  15 to 20 people on both sides. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=327.86s)]
*  But then in a follow up, he says JD Vance or Marco Rubio. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=329.74s)]
*  So that gives you a little palace intrigue. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=333.04s)]
*  Now we've just finished the first 100 days. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=335.26s)]
*  Usually you don't start talking about the next presidential election until midnight [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=338.86s)]
*  on the night of the midterm election in 2026. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=344.14s)]
*  But because of the situation that we're in, the Democrats have absolutely no one. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=346.68s)]
*  And Trump is saying, I'm not going to handpick a successor, at least not at this point, but [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=351.32s)]
*  that makes him more powerful because then he'll be able to say, let me look around. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=355.76s)]
*  Let me see who I like, who I don't like. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=360.12s)]
*  And maybe he will and maybe he won't. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=362.36s)]
*  And that will be the intrigue and drive a lot of media speculation. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=363.76s)]
*  I love palace intrigue. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  What about you Harold Ford Jr.? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=368.66s)]
*  I like palace intrigue too. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=370.04s)]
*  I'd say just a couple of things, Judge. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=371.04s)]
*  I think what she, Christine Welker, I think what she was saying regarding the due process, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  she was saying to Secretary Rubio who did say that he believed that citizens and non-citizens [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=377.44s)]
*  were deserving of due process. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=381.8s)]
*  And I think you could be right, but I do think the case down in Texas where you had the Trump, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=383.8s)]
*  we know that the Trump appointed judge who said the Alien Enemies Act could not be used [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  to deport these people without hearings. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=394.56s)]
*  What the court is ultimately going to decide is what you said earlier, Jesse, which I don't [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=396.64s)]
*  fully agree with what you said. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=399.62s)]
*  Who has due process rights? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=401.41999999999996s)]
*  Do citizens have it more than non-citizens? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=402.9s)]
*  That's what the court will have to decide. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=405.06s)]
*  Couple things. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=406.78s)]
*  I'm glad the president was not shy about talking about a third term, the hats and all that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=408.02s)]
*  kind of stuff. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  And that's him. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=412.97999999999996s)]
*  He wants to continue to be relevant. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=413.97999999999996s)]
*  If I were him, if you could do those things, you have that kind of authority to do it because [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=414.97999999999996s)]
*  after two years in the second term, you generally are a lame duck, maybe even after a year. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=417.78s)]
*  This president certainly won't be because he's made it clear. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  He's going to involve himself in who is his successor. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=424.64s)]
*  What I was most interested in the Welker interview was something a little different. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=427.56s)]
*  He said something there about tariffs in our economy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=429.96s)]
*  He said, you know, maybe kids today have too many toys and too many dolls. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  And that might be true. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=438.84s)]
*  But what I was hoping he might say in addition to that, because normally when you hear presidents [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=440.74s)]
*  say things like that and they're asking the country to sacrifice, they're asking us to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=444.28s)]
*  sacrifice on the part of making our country better. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=447.24s)]
*  Kennedy said, ask not what your country can do for you, but instead what you can do for [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=449.88s)]
*  your country. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=453.58s)]
*  I mean, if we're trying to make the country better by asking for more welders and electricians [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=454.58s)]
*  and engineers and nurse practitioners and maybe even air traffic controllers and said [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  we have to sacrifice a bit for that, that'd be great. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=462.02s)]
*  But what I didn't hear and what troubled me slightly is that if we're going to ask middle [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=464.18s)]
*  class and working class people to not give as many birthday gifts or Christmas gifts, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=467.86s)]
*  which might be fine, why not ask billionaires not to, is three planes enough? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=471.82s)]
*  Is three yachts enough? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=476.78s)]
*  Are four homes enough? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=477.78s)]
*  And say that we're going to take that money and pay down our debt. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=479.66s)]
*  I just don't think the very people, Mr. President, who made you president this second time, working [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=481.84s)]
*  class Americans, don't just ask them to sacrifice. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=486.12s)]
*  Isn't he talking about cheap goods out of China? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=488.68s)]
*  That's all he was talking about. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=490.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=491.48s)]
*  He was talking. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=492.48s)]
*  He said the price, I'm just quoting, you can play it back. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=493.48s)]
*  He said they don't need 30 dollars. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=495.08s)]
*  Maybe they'll pay more for two or three. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=497.28s)]
*  So he's admitting, I believe that's an acknowledgement, the price will go up. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=498.98s)]
*  Look, I don't even know. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=501.52s)]
*  I think I think sacrifice is good for our country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=502.52s)]
*  But don't just ask the working guy to do it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=505.32s)]
*  How do you turn that into a class division? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=507.66s)]
*  I didn't turn it, he said it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm reacting to it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  No, you're turning it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=513.0600000000001s)]
*  You're saying he's only asking average people and not rich people. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=514.0600000000001s)]
*  He is, because that's what he did. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=516.62s)]
*  No, he's asking everybody. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=517.86s)]
*  How many yachts are enough? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  How many homes are enough? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=521.5600000000001s)]
*  How relevant is that in terms of the message? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  Look, we're not going to touch your dolls, okay? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  Harold, you are so creepy sometimes. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=527.0600000000001s)]
*  You're almost 50. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=530.0600000000001s)]
*  It's always, always good to be back around. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=531.0600000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=533.0600000000001s)]
*  Up next, the far left eats their own. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=534.3599999999999s)]
*  AOC gets torched at her own town hall. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHOQX6Si6A&t=536.76s)]
