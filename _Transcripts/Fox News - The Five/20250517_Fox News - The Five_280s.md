# 'VERY CONCERNING': Nearly a dozen inmates escape jail, sparking massive search
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4)
*  All right, let's bring in Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=0.0s)]
*  Attorney General, thank you very much for being here. Give us a sense of what you think happened [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=4.4s)]
*  here. You hear in that sound bite the gap between when they think these people got out [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=8.64s)]
*  and when the public was informed. Yeah, Martha, so the gap is really, you know, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  recovering these individuals is obviously our first priority, but that gap in reporting time [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=19.36s)]
*  is extremely concerning. You know, it's my understanding as they were identified as missing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=25.12s)]
*  at a bed check, so there is some discrepancy on the information that I've received in terms of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=30.96s)]
*  when they were identified as missing and when the wider law enforcement was notified that they were [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=37.6s)]
*  missing. And, you know, at the state, if this happened at a state prison, then there would be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  immediate notification to law enforcement so that all the surrounding law enforcement agencies could [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=50.24s)]
*  engage and assist in containing these individuals, whoever they might be, from getting any further [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=54.64s)]
*  than they could possibly get. And here they've had a lot of lead time, which is very concerning. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=61.04s)]
*  So you're saying that they were discovered missing at bed check. What time is that? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=67.76s)]
*  You know, look, I've got a lot of questions. I don't have all the answers yet. Right now, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=73.68s)]
*  our priority is recovering these individuals, but these are all questions that I intend to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=78.0s)]
*  get answers to. The initial information that I received is that they were identified as missing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=82.88s)]
*  at a bed check. That can happen at a lot of different times in the evening, but, you know, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  common sense would tell you that it happened probably sometime between 10 o'clock and later. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  My understanding is that they escaped around midnight. And so regardless of what time the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=100.16s)]
*  bed check was, we know that they had a lot of lead time before wider law enforcement was notified [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=106.96s)]
*  that they were missing. OK, I want to play this from Ann Kirkpatrick, who I think the country has [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=112.72s)]
*  become a bit familiar with through a number of issues in New Orleans, including the attack in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=118.32s)]
*  the first of January. This is the Ann Kirkpatrick, New Orleans Police Department superintendent. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=125.44s)]
*  This was earlier today. Watch. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=131.04s)]
*  So she says, is it more likely that someone had help and that they are not running around [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=150.56s)]
*  in a jumpsuit, the attire that they would be wearing in this facility? If they were, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  that's going to be very likely to stand out. What's your what is your gut or based on any [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  information that you have so far telling you about whether or not someone helped them to get out? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=167.28s)]
*  Well, the whole thing is currently under investigation. My gut would tell me that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  they probably did have some help. You know, I think that we want to caution people now in the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=177.68s)]
*  community not to help them because they too will be charged as accessories to escape or principles [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=183.12s)]
*  to escape. And so they're going to be facing charges too. I mean, we will recover these [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=189.68s)]
*  individuals. They will have additional charges. They are dangerous. And so we want to protect [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=195.68s)]
*  the people that they might be a danger to now. But, you know, they could be a danger to anybody [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=202.56s)]
*  in the community if they're trying to get resources to get further away. Absolutely. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=206.96s)]
*  Just one example, Antoine Massey is charged with domestic abuse, battery, and strangulation. He's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=211.6s)]
*  just one of these individuals, illegal weapons, carrying simple burglary of a dwelling, intentional [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=220.32s)]
*  concealment of weapons. So obviously, there's a lot of concern with these individuals. And there's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=227.12s)]
*  a look at them. I would urge everybody, not just in Louisiana, who knows where some of these people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=231.28s)]
*  may have gotten to since midnight last night. And there are images that are circulating about how [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=236.96s)]
*  they may have gotten out of this facility. We're going to hear from this news conference and get [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  an update on all of this in about nine minutes from now. So we ask everyone to stay tuned for [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=248.8s)]
*  that. Attorney General Liz Murrell, thank you very much for being here. I know you're waiting for a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  lot of these answers and you'll have your own investigation underway as well. Thank you very [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=259.6s)]
*  much, General. Good to see you. Thanks for having me. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYHonJTLXp4&t=264.0s)]
