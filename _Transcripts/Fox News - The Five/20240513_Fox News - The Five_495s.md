# 'The Five': Anti-Israel agitators walk out on Jerry Seinfeld
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs)
*  The pro-Hamas lunatics out in full force to disrupt this weekend's graduation celebrations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=0.0s)]
*  Anti-Israel agitators walking out of Jerry Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke University [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=5.76s)]
*  with some of the crazies chanting, free Palestine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=11.44s)]
*  And that wasn't the only unhinged weekend walkout. Columbia University grads were wearing zip ties, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=14.88s)]
*  and one woman ripped up her diploma on stage. You know what, I'll go with the last one. Ripping up [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=35.04s)]
*  your diploma on stage, Jesse. Do you think that she should have ripped up her resume as well, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=42.2s)]
*  because she doesn't have a chance of getting a job? Alvin Bragg will probably hire her. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=47.56s)]
*  So graduation is just as much about the students as it is about the parents. Dad has been saving [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  for years. He's been pinching pennies. He wasn't able to get the hot rod that he wanted. But now [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=59.64s)]
*  the tuition is paid for. He wants to take a photo, have lunch, and have a drink. He doesn't want to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=64.2s)]
*  have to explain to the grandparents why Lizzie just walked off. They think Lizzie didn't even [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=69.8s)]
*  get a diploma. It's very confusing. So if I were to give anybody advice, I would say do your little [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=74.92s)]
*  Hamas thing when you accept the diploma. They hand it to you. You go free Palestine, and you walk off. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=80.52s)]
*  You just left Seinfeld. You don't get to hear what Jerry Seinfeld's advice was. This guy was the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=86.84s)]
*  biggest star of the 90s besides Greg. Thank you. It was a star at Men's Health. Less shiny, but still [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=93.4s)]
*  gleaming. This guy, he's wealthy. He has a young wife. He's a celebrity. Don't you want to learn [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=99.4s)]
*  from someone like that? And so what he did was he goes the key to life is hard work, relationships, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=105.64s)]
*  and exercise. And he's right. I would only add one thing, food. I'm reading this book about [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=112.12s)]
*  inflammation, Judge. I'll give it to you afterwards. It is just astounding. Oh, thanks for that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  No, not you personally. But we could all use better diets. But it's like they were choosing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  ignorance. And anybody knows you never choose ignorance. You just stumble upon it like me [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=126.84s)]
*  sometimes. Okay, Katie, thank you, by the way. I'll take the book. Katie, you know, Duke University [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=131.4s)]
*  was very different from the kids at Columbia. I mean, what do you attribute the difference to? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=138.04s)]
*  I mean, is it, you know, Columbia, they stormed the administration building. And Duke is totally [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  different. A few malcontents walk out, but they pretty much are yelling, Jerry, Jerry. Yeah, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=149.24s)]
*  so consequences for action. Maybe consequences for actions, geography, Columbia is in New York [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=155.0s)]
*  City, Duke is in North Carolina. You know, Jerry Seinfeld is someone who stopped going to college [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=159.88s)]
*  campuses a long time ago to do stand up because it just would be like this. But the facts are that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=164.6s)]
*  the majority of students around the country don't believe in this pro homo pro terrorism ideology [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=170.52s)]
*  that's ruining things for everybody else, because they believe in Western society, creativity, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=175.72s)]
*  the First Amendment, keeping their heads, women's rights, those types of things. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=180.92s)]
*  And to Jesse's point, for them to walk out and not want to listen and learn from someone who has had [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=185.16s)]
*  a very successful career and life in America, too bad for them. And they are just represents [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=190.27999999999997s)]
*  the larger liberal ideology of ripping things down constantly instead of, you know, building [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=197.16s)]
*  them up, whether it's ripping apart your diploma or, you know, destroying the commencement speech [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=202.92s)]
*  for everybody else. And, you know, for Jerry Seinfeld to get protested, he's an American. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=207.96s)]
*  So it's really more about anti-Semitism than it is about anti-Israel protesting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=212.6s)]
*  You know, Harold, this Sunday, Biden is giving a speech at Morehouse, which is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=217.24s)]
*  a Black college in Atlanta, a middle school. Yeah. And apparently some of the students are not happy [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  already. And one saying generally the feeling on the ground is we don't want them here. We're [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=227.0s)]
*  obviously being used to score political points. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=231.56s)]
*  You know, I think one of the great problems in education in our society today, whether it's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  education in the school or what we like to do with our kids, is a really unfortunate [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=241.0s)]
*  trend where we are encouraging people to only want to be around easy tables in life. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=245.16s)]
*  One of the reasons I love being around this table the night you all have me [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=250.12s)]
*  is that the conversation is always stimulating. It sometimes can be a little combative, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=253.72s)]
*  a little disagreeable, but we all have a healthy conversation and I walk away from it having [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=257.4s)]
*  learned and I hope I impart something that may make people think. Listening to these kids, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=261.96s)]
*  I listened to what you said. He is successful, but even if he wasn't, and you didn't mean it this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=266.44s)]
*  way, you nor Katie, even if he wasn't successful, the man has been, has accomplished something in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=269.4s)]
*  life and he's lived his life. He's had the ups and downs. He's had more ups than he has had downs. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=273.8s)]
*  He didn't talk politics in his speech. He said, in addition to what you said, Jesse, he said, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=279.56s)]
*  find something where you love the good parts and don't mind the bad parts too much. Now, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=284.76s)]
*  he's a comedian. He loves to sort of make fun of things and give a little satire to what he's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=288.44s)]
*  trying to say, but I hope the kids took that at heart. That for those that walked out, I hope they [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=293.24s)]
*  actually learned how to protest. They didn't walk out, Greg, and say, to your point, you made the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=297.32s)]
*  point earlier about the Hamas, that those who are LGBTQ hate Israel so much they'd rather be with [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=301.88s)]
*  people who might kill them if they were aligned with them, but I didn't hear them say Hamas take [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=307.96s)]
*  the deal for a ceasefire. Free the Israeli and American hostages. America, we think you should [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=311.64s)]
*  do differently there. This is them talking, but all they did was free Palestine and walk out. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't think we teach kids, we're not teaching Americans, we're not teaching citizens how you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=322.52s)]
*  protest, and frankly, worst off, we're not teaching people how to be around hard tables, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=326.84s)]
*  because hard tables can be fun. They can be interesting. They can be uplifting, and at the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=331.8s)]
*  end of the day, you can push everybody forward to get the higher ground. So thank you, Jerry Seinfeld, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=335.64s)]
*  for standing up, being there, and even speaking when those kids walked out. Greg, UNC Chapel Hill, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=340.28s)]
*  they are now moving to divert DEI funds to police and public safety. These are the kids who fought [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=346.28s)]
*  for the American flag and held it up? Typical historic white college. You don't ever hear that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=352.67999999999995s)]
*  I think, you know, it's funny. It all comes down to what Harold said, fun. Seinfeld is fun, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=359.4s)]
*  and the people that you see on the other part of this equation hate fun. That woman that tore up her [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  diploma, that was a diploma for social work. You know, it would have been more of a travesty if she [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  tore up like one of those paper placemat menus from IHOP, because that's what it's worth. Seinfeld [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=376.76s)]
*  makes a really good point about privilege in his speech. He says, yeah, I came from a place of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=382.35999999999996s)]
*  privilege, but so do you guys. You're graduating from Duke. I want to add to that and say like, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=388.12s)]
*  yeah, you should use your privilege. But if you don't find be a loser, no one's telling you to use [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=393.32s)]
*  it. No one's telling you not to use it except you. If you're rejecting the idea of privilege, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=398.84s)]
*  then you need to reject your diploma. You should reject, you shouldn't put Duke on your resume, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=404.28s)]
*  because that's privilege. You should take a vow of poverty. Anything that's related to your [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  privilege, you should reject, because everything you do in life is related to your privilege. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  A lot of people who say they don't have privilege have more privilege than they're [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=421.0s)]
*  willing to let on. On the whole though, when you look at the numbers, was what like 40 people? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=424.12s)]
*  You're seeing the literal example of the radical math. It's just a few idiots, but they pretend to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=429.8s)]
*  be more imposing, whether on social media or by having groups, far left groups sponsoring them. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=436.68s)]
*  And that should be a message to the colleges and to the Democrat party. Why are you so scared of a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=441.8s)]
*  tiny faction? Why are you held hostage by the nuttiest people in your party or even outside [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=446.28s)]
*  your party? I mean, they're afraid of these people. Maybe it's because they fear their [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=452.11999999999995s)]
*  anti-Semitic slip is showing. I don't know. But like you look at, you go like, why are you, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  you know what, the right wing has zanies. They do, but they bubble up from the bottom. You know, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=461.32s)]
*  there are the Q and ons from Reddit, but the Democrats, they come from above. You know, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=467.23999999999995s)]
*  they come from the professors. They come from the media. They come from these, you know, these [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=473.48s)]
*  weird organizations. The White House. Yeah, that one. Anyway, that's enough out of me. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egcL2-6ByZs&t=477.40000000000003s)]
