# Watters skeptical of Comey, Brennan probes: A lot of these guys 'skate' by #shorts #foxnews #news
**Fox News - The Five:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU)
*  We'll find out if there was a conspiracy or whether they lied to Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=0.0s)]
*  And I hope they pay the price, but they might not. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=3.44s)]
*  Because a lot of these guys skate all the time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=6.48s)]
*  So I'm not going to get my hopes up. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=8.8s)]
*  You saw what happened with Epstein. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=10.08s)]
*  You know, you get your hopes up, and then all of a sudden, poof, everything disappears. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=11.68s)]
*  So the Justice Department and the FBI have a lot riding on these prosecutions. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=15.36s)]
*  I'd like to see justice. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=19.28s)]
*  But it's like you get guys out there that say that there's this pipe bomb at the DNC, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=20.88s)]
*  and then like whatever happened to that? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  What about the Vegas shooter? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Remember how suspicious that whole thing was? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=27.52s)]
*  That disappears. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=29.84s)]
*  All these things always come across, and then they just disappear. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  And it's very frustrating for the American people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qw7l-bCvU&t=34.08s)]
