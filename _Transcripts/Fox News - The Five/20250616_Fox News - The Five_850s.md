# ‘The Five’: Israel strikes at the heart of Iran’s nuclear program
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo)
*  And it is the fourth day of the deadly conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump is talking to the press at the G7, and we are monitoring that for any [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=5.44s)]
*  big news. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=8.68s)]
*  In the meantime, let's go to Mike Tobin. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=9.68s)]
*  He can give us a quick catch up from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=11.0s)]
*  Hi, Mike. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=13.44s)]
*  Hi, Dana. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=14.44s)]
*  Iran is now interested in de-escalation and a return to the negotiating table with the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=15.44s)]
*  condition that the U.S. stays out of the fight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=21.16s)]
*  The U.S. for its part is now sending the USS Nimitz carrier strike group to the region [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=24.64s)]
*  ahead of schedule. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  There was a strike during a live broadcast of Iranian state TV, and what I can show you [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=31.36s)]
*  now is video of the aftermath of the state TV building in Tehran on fire. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=35.96s)]
*  Israel, for its part, did send a warning into the area warning people to evacuate ahead [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=41.56s)]
*  of that strike. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  State TV is now back on the air broadcasting from a backup location. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=48.4s)]
*  Israel's prime minister says Israeli jets can now do whatever they want in the skies [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=53.44s)]
*  over Tehran. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=57.68s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force controls the skies over Tehran. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=60.4s)]
*  This changes the entire campaign. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=64.28s)]
*  We are on the way to achieving our two goals, eliminating the nuclear threat and eliminating [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=66.92s)]
*  the missile threat. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=72.6s)]
*  We have new video of Iranian F-14s on the ground being taken out by Israeli airstrikes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=76.44s)]
*  Iran purchased those F-14s before the Islamic Revolution in 1979. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=82.08s)]
*  We also have satellite images of missile production and nuclear facilities before and after Israeli [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=87.32s)]
*  airstrikes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  Israel says one-third of Iran's missile launchers have now been destroyed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=93.96s)]
*  We keep getting warnings out of Iranian state TV and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=98.0s)]
*  drone strikes and missile strikes are inbound to Israel, but thus far they haven't materialized. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=105.08s)]
*  It doesn't mean they won't, but we usually get credible warnings from Israel's Home Front [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=111.08s)]
*  Command, and we haven't had that yet this evening. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=116.16s)]
*  Dana? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=118.04s)]
*  All right, Mike Tobin, thank you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=119.04s)]
*  Stay safe, and we will continue on with this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=120.04s)]
*  The big headline today, is Iran ready to wave the white flag and cry uncle? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=122.04s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Iran is seeking talks with the U.S. and Israel [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=126.12s)]
*  to end the hostilities. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=130.0s)]
*  President Trump out with world leaders at the G7 in Canada and once again imploring [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=131.98s)]
*  Iran to make a deal before it's too late. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=135.44s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm still in Iran. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=138.0s)]
*  Have you heard any signals or seen any messages from intermediaries that Iran wishes to de-escalate [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=141.48s)]
*  the conflict? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=147.32s)]
*  Yeah, they'd like to talk, but they should have done that before. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=148.32s)]
*  I had 60 days and they had 60 days, and on the 61st day I said, we don't have a deal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=152.12s)]
*  They have to make a deal. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=158.92s)]
*  And it's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=160.28s)]
*  And they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  Jesse, President Trump has been consistent for 10 years that Iran should not be allowed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  to have a nuclear weapon and letting Israel do what it thinks it needs to do to protect itself. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  Right, so we're pretty involved already. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=180.6s)]
*  We green lit the operation, obviously. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=182.64s)]
*  We're intercepting all the missiles that Iran's sending over, and we have shared intelligence [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=184.84s)]
*  and are doing refueling flights. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  The question is, how much more involved are we going to get? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=190.94s)]
*  And so a few scenarios. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=194.28s)]
*  One, if the Iranians attack U.S. assets, we'll have to get involved. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=195.88s)]
*  The question is whether we're going to give or use bunker-busting bombs to completely [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=200.2s)]
*  eliminate the Iranian nuclear program or if we'll authorize regime change strikes against [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=205.56s)]
*  the leadership. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=211.88s)]
*  And I think the balance that Trump's trying to strike is you can't allow the Iranians [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=213.64s)]
*  to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=218.04s)]
*  It's been almost 100 years of U.S. policy non-peripheration. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=220.0s)]
*  You can't get blackmailed by rogue states. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=224.98s)]
*  But also, you can't have regime change wars, and those have unintended consequences. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=227.76s)]
*  So if you were to have a decapitation strike against the Iranian leadership, what comes [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  next? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=239.04s)]
*  Because it's a theocracy, and you have 30,000 radical Muslim clerics that are still there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=240.04s)]
*  You can't kill all of them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  So does it break down into militia factions where they all just kill each other? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=245.64s)]
*  Do we install somebody? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=249.6s)]
*  Do people come from all over the region with guns? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=251.2s)]
*  Is there an insurgency? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=254.88s)]
*  And so the Israelis have their own agenda. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=256.52s)]
*  They want this guy gone. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  Now, does that agenda jive with our agenda? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=262.24s)]
*  Maybe not, because they're not going to be the ones to manage the chaos. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=265.32s)]
*  We're going to have to manage the chaos, and they know that, and that's fine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=268.52s)]
*  But we've already overthrown an Iranian leader before. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=272.06s)]
*  We installed the Shah, and he was a great ally for many years. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=275.68s)]
*  And he pumped oil, and he was fantastic against the Soviets, but he was so unpopular, he was [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=278.64s)]
*  overthrown by these even more fundamental, radical people who we're still dealing with [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=283.76s)]
*  today. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  The big question is, is the Iranian nuke deal still possible? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  The Israelis say no. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=293.96s)]
*  They call them fake talks. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=295.3s)]
*  They think they're going nowhere and we're getting strung along. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=296.68s)]
*  Donald Trump disagrees. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=299.2s)]
*  He thinks there can be a deal that was put together. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=300.88s)]
*  And at this point, the Iranians have no leverage. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=304.68s)]
*  And so it looks like they're kind of begging to come back to the negotiating table. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=307.9s)]
*  And Donald Trump isn't ready to do the deal yet. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=312.04s)]
*  I think he's going to let the Israeli military continue to soften up Iranian targets until [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=314.44s)]
*  they finally limp back to the negotiation table and swear off enrichment. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=319.56s)]
*  And that would be a great outcome if they swear off enrichment. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=324.68s)]
*  But I don't know if that's even possible, because the Iranians saw what happened to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  Gaddafi. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=331.16s)]
*  Remember after Saddam was toppled, Gaddafi was like, all right, we'll get rid of the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  nukes. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=336.36s)]
*  And the next thing you know, Hillary and the Europeans came in and took him out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=337.36s)]
*  So very delicate situation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=340.6s)]
*  The next couple of days will be pretty serious. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  And the IAEA, which I guess is basically the international organization that checks on [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  nuclear enrichment, just last week they said that Iran is in total noncompliance, Harold. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=351.24s)]
*  And at the same time, the Israelis said, we underestimated our enemy on October 7th and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=358.1s)]
*  we can't afford to do it again because they're closer than ever to a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=363.0s)]
*  So now the stage is set. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=366.74s)]
*  In the meantime, though, we still have, we, Israel, has 53 hostages still in Gaza. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=368.72s)]
*  So good to be back around the table. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=375.32000000000005s)]
*  Hope everyone had a productive and happy Father's Day weekend. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=377.16s)]
*  Jesse, you framed it fairly well. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  I think the only thing I would add to what you eloquently said is two things. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=382.24s)]
*  First, we're going to be confronted as a nation very soon with whether or not we should provide [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  the wherewithal and the resources. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=392.88000000000005s)]
*  We're the ones with the ammunition and that bunker busting bomb that you talked about [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=394.42s)]
*  that would be used to blow up a half a mile under earth. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=398.5s)]
*  They're the mountain that we've identified, that the Israelis have identified. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=403.42s)]
*  I'm a believer that we should. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=406.74s)]
*  If the Israelis believe that's what's needed to put an end to this. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=410.74s)]
*  I listened to Mr. Netanyahu, who I'm not always a fan of, but I listened to him on Sunday [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=414.5s)]
*  and had a chance to react to him on Brett Baer's show. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=419.22s)]
*  Brett did a really good interview. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=421.86s)]
*  I thought Mr. Netanyahu was convincing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=423.3s)]
*  He made two points there. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=426.46s)]
*  He said first, the slumber of democracy, he invoked Churchill talking about when democracies [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=427.7s)]
*  get lazy, they get content. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  This is when these kind of evil things happen. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=436.2s)]
*  We have a moment here to stop this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=438.62s)]
*  He also spoke to the Iranian people and spoke to the Persian people and said, look, the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=440.9s)]
*  Israelis and the Persian people have had a great relationship over the many centuries. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=444.94s)]
*  There's no reason going forward if we get past this ugly and unfortunate chapter that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=447.78s)]
*  we can't do the same going forward. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=452.22s)]
*  Now, I understand, Dana, some of the concerns that Democrat and Republican politicians, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=454.14s)]
*  including some supporters of President Trump, have about broadening this war, because the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=458.7s)]
*  real risk here is the escalation of the war. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=463.5s)]
*  Jack Keane said something I thought very, very telling over the weekend as well, and [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  even repeated on our network today. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=470.18s)]
*  He said that the Army, Navy and Air Force of the Iranians have been diminished and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=472.3s)]
*  weakened and that the leadership of their Army, Navy and Air Force are diminished and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=476.9s)]
*  poor as well. And if we're thinking about the moment in a way to put an end to this, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=481.48s)]
*  this might be the moment to do it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  I remember when there were those who were saying we should have supplied more support and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=487.8s)]
*  more resources for the Ukrainians against the Russians. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=491.24s)]
*  President Trump often says that had he been president, that never would have happened. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=493.44s)]
*  Russia would have never invaded Ukraine. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  And I assume he meant that he would have provided more resources and tools for the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=499.36s)]
*  Ukrainians. I think we're at that moment now, Dana, with this Iranian-Israeli conflict. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=503.16s)]
*  I don't want a broadening of the conflict. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=507.88s)]
*  I don't want an escalation. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=509.64000000000004s)]
*  I think the president of Turkey and others are right. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=511.04s)]
*  We are we're in a precipice. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=512.76s)]
*  But what I don't want to happen going forward is this risk and threat that the Iranians [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=514.96s)]
*  pose. And what you offer, what you led into this question about, they have lied about [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=518.96s)]
*  their preparation, their ability to develop and detonate a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=523.12s)]
*  I don't want that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=527.4s)]
*  And even if the IEA is wrong, I'm willing to take the risk. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  If we have this moment now, we should destroy this capability of the Iranians. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=532.32s)]
*  Kennedy, I feel like President Trump doesn't get credit for something else. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=536.96s)]
*  It's a key part of this story, but it's a smaller part of the story. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=539.88s)]
*  And it's that, first of all, Israel did degrade the capabilities of Hezbollah and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=543.12s)]
*  Hamas. And then you have President Trump in the Middle East just two weeks ago [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=547.92s)]
*  and making making friends, making allies and recognizing the new Syrian government [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=552.24s)]
*  to the point that yesterday, not when the started four days ago, Lebanon said, we're [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=557.96s)]
*  staying out of it. And then Syria, Yestersee, you can use our airspace. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=562.32s)]
*  And if you just hold that thought, because we have a new sound from President Trump, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=567.64s)]
*  he was just asked about the possibility of regime change in Iran. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=571.08s)]
*  And we can listen to that and then we'll come back around to Kennedy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=575.12s)]
*  I want to see no nuclear weapon in Iran and we're well in our way to making sure that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=581.48s)]
*  happens. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=586.4s)]
*  And a short comment, Kennedy, I wasn't sure how long that would be your thoughts. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=588.48s)]
*  Ha ha. Yes, I think he shares that sentiment with the entire Western world. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=592.24s)]
*  No one wants Iran to have a nuclear weapon because, you know, this is not the era of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=598.24s)]
*  detente of mutually assured destruction where, you know, there were countries stockpiling [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=602.8s)]
*  nuclear weapons for defensive reasons. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=607.84s)]
*  Iran has talked about going on the offense. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=610.44s)]
*  And part of the existence of this regime is the desire to annihilate Israel, you [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=613.48s)]
*  know, which is right next door. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=620.24s)]
*  Think about it. What if Canada talked to what if the reason for being for Canada was [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=621.48s)]
*  to destroy and obliterate the United States? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=626.76s)]
*  I was recently on a Holocaust tour in Poland and we visited the extermination [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=630.12s)]
*  camps. And, you know, that took years for Nazi Germany to exterminate six million [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=635.52s)]
*  Jews and three million Catholic Poles. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=642.32s)]
*  Iran wants to do what Hitler started with one bomb. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=644.72s)]
*  And that's the fear. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=648.52s)]
*  So Israel has started this. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=649.88s)]
*  And now what the United States has to ask itself, are we going to be the ones who [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  finish it? Because it will if you're talking about the main enriching site for uranium, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  the Fordow site, that will take the kind of bunker buster that Israel does not have. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  I spoke to a former Navy SEAL senior chief and he said, yes, Israel does have bunker [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=666.88s)]
*  busting bombs, but not the massive type where it'll take a pair with a B-2 bomber in [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=672.4s)]
*  order to completely obliterate that facility. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=678.0s)]
*  That is a possibility if the United States wants to get involved. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=681.2s)]
*  Iran does not want the U.S. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=684.6s)]
*  to get involved because they know it is not only the end of their nuclear program, but [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=686.16s)]
*  also their petroleum program as well. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=690.76s)]
*  So what does Iran have left? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=693.44s)]
*  What they're clinging on to now is the desperate hope. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=695.64s)]
*  They will, with some of their other Middle East partners, be able to move forward [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=698.88s)]
*  capitalistic in a way that takes them out of petroleum but into the economic future. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=704.48s)]
*  They can't do that as an authoritarian, theocratic regime relying solely on oil. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=710.32s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=717.08s)]
*  This is a tough one. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=718.6s)]
*  You know, is Trump's actions a violation of the Trump doctrine, which is America [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=719.6s)]
*  first? I think that's the debate that's kind of raging among the right. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=727.2s)]
*  But you elected Trump because you trust him. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=733.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=736.88s)]
*  He's been consistent on everything, pretty much everything here and there. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=738.76s)]
*  He's directionally consistent. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=743.76s)]
*  I don't remember him being for any wars. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=745.88s)]
*  He was very he was outspoken about most of them. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=749.04s)]
*  So I think to say, oh, now he's a neocon is unfair. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=751.84s)]
*  You know, he wouldn't do this unless he thought it had to be done. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=756.6s)]
*  So you kind of have to give him the benefit of the doubt, which you cannot do with Iran. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  Iran is like the T-1000, you know, in the second Terminator movie. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=766.4s)]
*  You'd knock it down. You'd knock down its nuclear capabilities and it reconstitute [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=770.72s)]
*  itself. And so your only hope is that you make the time it takes to reconstitute longer [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=774.76s)]
*  and longer. You're not kicking the can down the road. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=779.96s)]
*  You're kicking Tehran down the road. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=782.48s)]
*  And it's like whether or not you want to do it now, you know, you have to weigh the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=784.52s)]
*  benefits. I don't want to sound wishy washy, but you know, it's all about frame of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=790.52s)]
*  reference. You know, Israel has the Holocaust. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=793.84s)]
*  That is their frame of reference. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=796.76s)]
*  This is not going to happen again. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=798.16s)]
*  You know, if Israel was around before, there wouldn't have been a Holocaust. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=799.64s)]
*  But then the other frame of reference is Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=803.56s)]
*  We were promised an end to that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=809.72s)]
*  So somehow you've got to like start fresh with this and try to to push the back story [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=811.88s)]
*  of history off on the side. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=819.24s)]
*  I don't know if that's possible, you know, but, you know, if you're going to trust [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=820.76s)]
*  somebody, I would trust Trump and not Iran. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=825.72s)]
*  That's where I'm at. In addition, I would trust the Middle East allies that he met [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=829.28s)]
*  with who are pretty quiet about all of this happening and not unhappy about it as [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=833.84s)]
*  reported, apparently. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=839.6s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7FrEnZdyo&t=840.76s)]
