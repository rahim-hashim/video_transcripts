# ‘REPULSIVE’: Gutfeld rips into Dems trying to score ‘symbolic virtue points’ over Maryland deportee
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ)
*  The White House wrapping up a briefing with shocking new information on the media's so-called [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Maryland dad, the alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Caroline Levitt was joined by the mother of Rachel Moran. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Her daughter was brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant. Here's Caroline. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=14.8s)]
*  The Democrats and the media in this room have continually and wrongly labeled Kilmar Abrego-Garcia [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=20.72s)]
*  as a Maryland father. There is no Maryland father. Let me reiterate Kilmar Abrego-Garcia [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=27.92s)]
*  is an illegal alien, MS-13 gang member, and foreign terrorist who was deported back to his home country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=35.440000000000005s)]
*  That comes as Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen went to El Salvador in order to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  fetch his Salvadorian constituent that he claims was quote illegally abducted. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  This is about due process. This is about rule of law. What bullies do is they begin by picking on [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=58.32s)]
*  the most vulnerable. I just landed at the airport in San Salvador a little while ago. I'm now on route [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=64.56s)]
*  into the city. The goal of my visit is to talk to people here about the release of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=70.8s)]
*  I won't stop trying and I can assure the president, the vice president that I may be the first [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  United States senator to visit El Salvador on this issue, but there will be more and there will be [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=87.12s)]
*  more members of Congress coming. And at the briefing, Rachel Moran's mother ripped her [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=92.72s)]
*  senator's trip. Of a senator from Maryland who didn't even acknowledge or barely acknowledged [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=98.56s)]
*  my daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  and now a grandbaby without a grandmother so that he can use my taxpayer money [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=116.8s)]
*  to fly to El Salvador to bring back someone that's not even an American citizen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=124.32s)]
*  Why does that person have more right than I do or my daughter or my grandchildren? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=131.76s)]
*  I don't understand this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=141.04s)]
*  All right, Harold, I'll start with you. What we found out is the Maryland father [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=148.16s)]
*  was not working at Home Depot as was represented here yesterday. He was one of the illegals standing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=156.0s)]
*  outside waiting to be picked up as they often do to get a job for cash under the table. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=162.64s)]
*  In addition, we also have the police report indicating the reasons why he was identified [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=168.48s)]
*  as MS-13. We also have two court orders saying that Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 gang member and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  needed to be deported. And in addition to that, the father of the year, Abrego Garcia, that a United [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  States senator never called Rachel Moran's mother, who was a constituent of his, is going to see [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=189.04s)]
*  El Salvador. The man he's going to see, his common law wife, we don't even know if they were [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=196.56s)]
*  really married, filed two, not once, but two orders of protection against him for assaulting her, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=202.96s)]
*  for punching her, scratching her, ripping off her shirt and beating her. So we've got domestic [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=211.12s)]
*  violence, MS-13 court orders, and not only that, he didn't even come into this country through a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  port of entry. He's one of the gotaways. He was too dangerous. He knew he wouldn't have been let in. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=223.44s)]
*  So why is the senator going there, Harold? Well, he has every right to go. First, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=230.96s)]
*  it's good to be with you. He has every right as a U.S. senator to go wherever he wants. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=234.48s)]
*  Nobody was questioning that. And Ms. Moran had, I was moved by her words, Judge, I think we all were, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=238.88s)]
*  and by reminding us of that terrible, awful, tragic story that her daughter had to endure [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=245.12s)]
*  and what the pain that it has caused her and her family. I separate the two for really a single [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=251.12s)]
*  reason. I think this situation with the Garcia guy, it appears that the court has said that they want [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=257.44s)]
*  the lawyers for Mr. Garcia and the lawyers for the government to be deposed and for evidence to be [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  presented to the court that Mr. Garcia fits the description that some of which you just described [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=272.48s)]
*  their judge in terms of his status in the country, his MS-13 status, whatever that may be. And if [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=278.8s)]
*  these things are all true, then he should certainly be deported and maybe even worse things done. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=285.04s)]
*  But it appears that's where the gulf is here. But I'm so moved by Ms. Moran's story, it's hard to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  even talk about Senator Van Hollen, who has the right to be there, and Ms. Moran, who I was pleased [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  to hear and happy to hear her share her story, as hard as it may have been for her to share it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=303.92s)]
*  I do hope that the judges' exhortions to both the defense, the government, and the plaintiffs, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=309.44s)]
*  she said that she, everybody to cancel their vacation and to cancel other time and to be back [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=316.24s)]
*  before the court with this evidence, because I think the country deserves to hear this and certainly [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=320.24s)]
*  this family deserves to know if this guy was indeed a member of MS-13. All right, Jesse, I'm going to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=324.72s)]
*  spin right off of what Harold just said. Harold is talking about Judge Boesberg, I assume? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=331.28s)]
*  No, I'm talking about the judge in the case with Mr. Garcia, the Boesberg case. He spoke a little [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=336.96s)]
*  differently, but yes, yes, we're kind of conflating two things here. But I'm talking about, I can't [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=344.55999999999995s)]
*  think of her last name as Zinni. I'm talking about Judge Zinni. So Jesse, the fact that an [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=350.08s)]
*  immigration court and an immigration appeals court has already made the decision that Abrego Garcia [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=355.11999999999995s)]
*  should be deported indicates to me as a former judge and a prosecutor that he has already been [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  given due process. And in fact, this further information is even more reason why he should [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  stay in El Salvador as if we could go there and bring him back here to deport him yet again. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=373.11999999999995s)]
*  Well, he's getting a great hearing because his law firm represents notorious gang members. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  His law firm represents Aaron Hernandez, Bloods, represented Bobby Schmurda, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=384.0s)]
*  GS9 out of Brooklyn, represents a trafficking syndicate that does deals with the cartels. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=389.68s)]
*  So somehow this Maryland dad gets the best gang affiliated law firm in the country to do this [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=395.92s)]
*  guy's case. He illegally immigrates into the country under Barack Obama, gets pulled over [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=402.56s)]
*  five times in Maryland, but never gets deported because they're a sanctuary state and blows off [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=406.96s)]
*  every hearing. Then he gets an American woman pregnant. Doesn't marry her, none of my business. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=412.0s)]
*  He gets picked up in a gang sweep. It was a murder investigation. They bring him in. He had [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=417.28s)]
*  a thousand dollars cash. He had a bull's hat with the logo of the horns. MS-13. He had a sweatshirt [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=423.52s)]
*  on. Hear no evil, see no evil. MS-13. They ask him about human trafficking. All of a sudden he goes, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=430.32s)]
*  oh, I'm really afraid to go back to El Salvador. They might kill me. The judge doesn't let him out [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=437.2s)]
*  on bond because he's a flight risk and he's a danger to the community. He appeals. Another judge [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=442.72s)]
*  says no. Doesn't uphold the asylum claim. Again, affirms he's designated MS-13. The only reason [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=447.76000000000005s)]
*  he's not deported back to El Salvador then is because his great lawyers say he's going to be [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=455.44000000000005s)]
*  killed by a rival gang, but they let him out. But he can be deported at any time, but guess who doesn't [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  do it? Joe Biden. Then what does he do? He allegedly beats his wife. Not once, but twice. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=465.36s)]
*  Close fist. Still not deported. Trump becomes president. He designates MS-13 a terrorist [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=472.32s)]
*  organization. That means it vacates the hold on the deportation to El Salvador. He can be deported [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=478.48s)]
*  to El Salvador. They put him on a plane and he's there. The lawyers want to go back, reopen the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=486.64s)]
*  case with the immigration judge. It's a clerical issue. It reopens. He gets deported back to El [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  Salvador. Case closed. The fact that this guy wanted to put Trump in prison, but get this guy [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=501.36s)]
*  out of prison, an MS-13 terrorist who's accused of hitting his wife, is crazy. You know, Dana, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  the Rachel Moran's mother, and I think we really have to talk about that, is one of many, many [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=515.04s)]
*  mothers in this country who have lost daughters in a horrific way, some of them as young as 11, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=521.44s)]
*  to illegals who were never vetted by the Biden administration. And yet the left and a United [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=528.16s)]
*  States senator is on the wrong side of the issue. Instead of fighting for American citizens in a [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=534.96s)]
*  90-10 issue at this point, he's fighting to make sure that an illegal dirtbag gang member who's an [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=541.84s)]
*  abuser is okay. What is wrong with the Democrats? So you'd like to believe that the senator and his [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=548.96s)]
*  team didn't think this through, right? You'd like to believe that this was a lapse in judgment, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=557.04s)]
*  but they did think it through. They think this is the right thing to do. I feel like if this was an [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  episode of Veep, you might believe it more, but unfortunately it is the reality that they were, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=569.68s)]
*  he was part of the big cover-up of Biden's mental capacities. He was somebody who, yes, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=577.04s)]
*  he did talk about Rachel Moran. He did. He has done statements, but he never called her. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=584.24s)]
*  And this is obviously a woman who wants to talk about what happened to her daughter [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=588.8s)]
*  and to make sure justice is done so that it never happens to another daughter. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=592.64s)]
*  That is her main mission. And it is remarkable how many women who have lost their daughters or their [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  sons, even if it's on fentanyl or something, something that is gang-related as well, right? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=603.2s)]
*  The cartel is bringing the drugs into the country. How many of the mothers are able to be so poised [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=607.44s)]
*  and I didn't realize, well, we were taking it live, but Greg said to me that the other cable [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=614.48s)]
*  channels didn't take it. No surprise. And like this is an opportunity as a unique opportunity [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=618.32s)]
*  in the briefing room and you might not want to hear it. And it is really hard to listen to. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=622.8s)]
*  And your heart breaks for her. And I can understand that I'm sure they're back in the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=627.04s)]
*  Senate or is often saying, but the rule of law. And there may be, there is a question on the law [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=631.04s)]
*  here that's obviously it's being dealt with in the courts, the justice department fighting as hard [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=637.04s)]
*  as they can, releasing new information. I think you made a good point about the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=641.36s)]
*  foreign terrorist organization, which vacated the previous room. All of that can get teased out, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=645.84s)]
*  but can't be forgotten is that President Trump ran on this issue. It was the number one issue [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=649.92s)]
*  with the American people along with the highest prices that they have paid for goods in their [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=654.64s)]
*  lives. And the president and what Caroline Levitt did today is say, we're not going to forget. And [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=659.44s)]
*  in fact, we're going to put this right in your face so that you can't forget. And even if the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=664.24s)]
*  other cables didn't take it, it doesn't matter. This story is front and center. And it will be, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=668.56s)]
*  this guy is now going to be like the poster child for you want to have this fight. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLMjGWAIIQ&t=673.92s)]
