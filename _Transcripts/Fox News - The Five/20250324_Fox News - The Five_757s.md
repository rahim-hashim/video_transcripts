# ‘The Five’: Dems keep digging into a deeper, darker hole
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68)
*  The Democrat disaster gets even worse, and the now party is looking for uber-progressive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=0.0s)]
*  AOC to save them. Dems are in the deepest hole in nearly 50 years, and this may not [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=7.68s)]
*  be rock bottom. The party has its lowest favorability ever. Young voters are flocking to the right. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=14.4s)]
*  Americans are fleeing blue states and droves, and they have no national leader. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=21.36s)]
*  Don't believe me? Watch for yourself. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=26.4s)]
*  Are you feeling pressure to step down? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  Look, I'm not stepping down. The American people are fed up with the old guard. There needs to be [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  a renewal. This looks like game over, you know, and the reason why people are voting with their feet [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=41.44s)]
*  is a lot of what your book is about. Yeah. Taxes and regulation. You know what the problem is with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=47.36s)]
*  the left. They seem too lame. They do. They got it. It needs a revamping. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=53.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Bernie is touring the country, trashing Trump, Elon, and the oligarchs. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=61.36s)]
*  The socialist blowhard doesn't want to answer the tough questions plaguing his party. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=66.64s)]
*  Would you like to see her join in the Senate? Right now we have, as I said, just a whole lot [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  of people in the Congress. Okay, Jonathan, thanks. Wait, I got one more. I got one more. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=77.28s)]
*  I asked you, you know, you want to do nonsense, do nonsense. No. I don't want to talk about inside [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  the beltway stuff. I got 32,000 people. I was just asking you about AOC because she was out there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, fine, but I don't want to talk about this. What was the last question? I was just going to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=90.96s)]
*  ask you one more question about you. I mean, that's all. I was literally the last. What is your [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=94.32s)]
*  question? I mean, it's easier. But is there a far left light at the end of the tunnel? The New York [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=98.32s)]
*  Times is hyping up AOC as the 2028 answer to all of the Democrats' problems. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=109.2s)]
*  All right, Jessica, there's no question that the party has its lowest favorability in at least [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  half a century. It means they have virtually no credibility. You really have to work hard to get [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  here, don't you? We're exhausted from working this hard. It's bad. Of course, it's bad. We just lost [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=128.0s)]
*  an election. We have to rebuild. We have to figure it out. I think that people are flocking [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=136.16s)]
*  to AOC and Bernie because they are capturing the spirit of the moment, which is where you need to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=142.48s)]
*  be real opposition. You need to have backbone. You can't be spineless about these things. There [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=147.68s)]
*  was an interesting exchange online where John Fetterman went after AOC and then Conor Lamb, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=152.16s)]
*  who lost to Fetterman in the primary for that Senate seat. So the conservative Democratic [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=158.96s)]
*  congressman and Tim Ryan came to AOC's defense over Fetterman because they understand that she is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=163.36s)]
*  meeting the moment. But all hope is not lost. Health care is going to be an incredibly important [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=169.52s)]
*  part of the discourse. Democrats still lead on who's best to handle that. And I'm increasingly [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=177.52s)]
*  thinking that James Carville was right in saying that we should take a bit of a breather and run [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=181.68s)]
*  out the clock a bit here and watch what happens. So Donald Trump's ratings on handling the economy [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=187.44000000000003s)]
*  inflation cost of living are all tanking. And we're seeing this administration's incompetence [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=193.36s)]
*  and recklessness on a scale unimaginable. I'm sure you guys saw this incredible Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  piece from right before we got on air a couple of years ago about Goldberg, who is a journalist at [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  the Atlantic being invited into a private signal chat with all of our national security heads. So [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=210.56s)]
*  Rubio, Hegseth, Waltz, Tulsi Gabbard, Scott Bessinson there, et cetera. And they are planning on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  just signal to drop bombs in Yemen. So they're not doing this in a skiff. They're doing it on [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=222.96s)]
*  an app that you and I, we all have on our phones. And it's obviously incredibly reckless national [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  security risks. I don't want to ever hear but her emails again. I don't know what's going to happen [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  to anyone who's involved in something like this. But on top of it, you have the vice president. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=241.36s)]
*  He's in there as well, contradicting Donald Trump on his policy on Europe. So all of this is going [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  on. We're only a couple months into this administration. And when Carville says, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=251.92s)]
*  let's see what they do, you got stuff like this. Makes you happy. No, it, okay. No, but it does [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=256.8s)]
*  confirm when people said that folks were getting these jobs that didn't deserve them, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=264.64s)]
*  that that's probably the case. And I'm sure you make a mistake. This is a mistake. Just [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=268.56s)]
*  admit you're happy. I'm not. No, I'm actually, I would see here. Yeah. All right, Jesse, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=272.56s)]
*  you know what? Some of the Dems say that they're fed up with the old guard, but isn't the failure [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=277.92s)]
*  of the party about the progressives, which are ostensibly the younger group? And, you know, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=283.76s)]
*  are they blaming, who are they blaming? Let's not let them think the progressives are the problem. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=289.36s)]
*  Let's let them run AOC. They're O and two running women. So I think just roll the dice again, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  run AOC and let the chips fall. It is funny how the old guard tries to keep the young generation [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  down. It's creating this little bottleneck. It's fun to watch. We had that problem. We don't have [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=307.36s)]
*  that anymore. We have a whole new fresh crew of young bloods running around. And yeah, they [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  accidentally leaked something to the media instead of the Democrats actually leaking classified [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=318.64s)]
*  information to the media. No, no, no, no, no, no. All right. At least they didn't home brew a server [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=325.44s)]
*  and acid wash it. But her emails, I just did it. A famous Greek, a famous, Marlavo Toilets. And they invited him in. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=330.16s)]
*  Marlavo Toilets. Yeah, where the national security secrets that were just a family show. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=337.12s)]
*  Jessica, can we just stick with the topic today? A famous Greek philosopher, Jessica Heraclitus [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=341.52s)]
*  or Cletus. I don't know. I hope it's not the last one. Watch your mouth. It's definitely not Heraclitus. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=348.16s)]
*  Said change is the only constant in life. And Democrats forgot that axiom because they thought [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=353.76s)]
*  they'd always have the youth vote. They thought that the non-white vote would keep Democrats in [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=358.48s)]
*  power forever. But they were both wrong. But they have longer term structural problems. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=364.24s)]
*  All of these people are leaving blue states and moving to red states. And you guys are losing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=369.04s)]
*  electoral votes. So the next election, you could lose, you could win the entire Rust Belt and then [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=374.72s)]
*  not hit 270 because you didn't think the people had the agency or the initiative to leave your [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=380.0s)]
*  horrible dens of corruption and incompetence and go to a place with greener pastures or redder [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=385.92s)]
*  pastures. You've lost the culture. You've lost your credibility and you've lost your two pillars [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=391.6s)]
*  of propaganda, Twitter and the media. So right now you're in a civil war. The normie wing of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  Federman and Rom want to do things right. And then you have AOC and Bernie. And I see three [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=401.68s)]
*  scenarios, Jessica. I see you guys running a progressive and having that person get demolished [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=407.44s)]
*  and the normies say, see, I told you so. Or you run a normie and the progressives boycott it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  And then they lose again. Or an independent pops up and he basically fractures the party, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=419.36s)]
*  like, parodied to the Republicans and you lose again. All of these are losing scenarios that I [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  just laid out. Do you have a winning scenario? Let's go to Dana. Dana, now you've got Bernie [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=429.76s)]
*  Sanders and AOC and they're getting some big crowds. And Bernie Sanders is now admitting that, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=437.92s)]
*  the Democratic Party was wrong about the border and that Trump was right about cracking down on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=444.24s)]
*  the border. But AOC doesn't agree with that. She's totally opposite. I mean, so as a team, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=450.16s)]
*  they're not really on the same side. I think that the crowds, it is impressive. Like if you have [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=454.96s)]
*  the fact that the Democrats are basically in the doldrums and circling the drain and then you get, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=460.24s)]
*  20,000 people to show up at an event. But I think that they could have done that anyway, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=465.76s)]
*  because Bernie Sanders has had a constituency for a long time. It's sort of like Ron Paul has [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=469.84s)]
*  a constituency. Like people love him. There are people who love Bernie Sanders and AOC is smart [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  and she's opportunistic. And she says, I can help. And Bernie is smart because he knows I'm 83 years [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  old. I need somebody to come out here and help me with these crowds. And she can whip up a crowd. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=485.84s)]
*  Problem is they're not building any numbers. They're just re-plowing the same old ground. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=490.0s)]
*  She said over the weekend, we need someone who will fight harder for us, not fight smarter. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's one of their big problems. They have already lost the working class to MAGA. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=499.52s)]
*  So they're sitting there saying, the rich people are awful. And MAGA is saying, yeah, we agree. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=506.08s)]
*  The rich people are terrible. But their big constituency is college-educated women. And now [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  they have them, but the youth vote is so interesting. This new report that David [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=516.88s)]
*  Schor did said that that is the thing that is the most alarming to him. And it's almost like the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  reverse of what happened in the 60s, or I would say 60s. And so we're living through this political [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=526.08s)]
*  realignment. And I would also add just one other thing. There's all the sorts of things that happen, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=531.36s)]
*  the COVID closures in the Biden administration, but the obsession from Obama through Biden on [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=536.72s)]
*  climate change, in which they used a lot of taxpayer dollars in order to fund some crazy stuff [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=544.32s)]
*  that is going to have lasting implications. Not only was there corruption and fraud, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=549.44s)]
*  Stacey Abrams getting $2 billion, for example, but also if you live in New Jersey, for example, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=553.6s)]
*  you are about to have to swallow a huge increase in your electricity rates. Why? Because that state [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=559.84s)]
*  government under Phil Murphy has pushed through something even more onerous than even the ones [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=566.64s)]
*  that are here in New York City. So all of these things are continuing to remind people who have [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=571.44s)]
*  an affordability problem that the Democrats don't stand for them. You know, Greg, it took [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=576.72s)]
*  four years for the Democrat Party to pretty much throw Joe Biden over the edge. Now it appears that [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=583.6s)]
*  within three months, they're ready to throw Schumer over the edge. I mean, is this, did they learn [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=589.92s)]
*  their lesson or are they just lost at sea? I think the big lesson here is that young voters [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=595.36s)]
*  are flocking to the right. And all I could say is, you're welcome, America. Kids can't get enough of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=601.28s)]
*  America's bad boy. Dems are like zombies. Don't kid yourself, they always come back. They always [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=607.52s)]
*  turn into though something else. Political correctness, if that was ice cream, wokeism [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=613.12s)]
*  is gelato. They come back more intense, more concentrated, which raises the question, how should [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  our reaction be when, and it's a when, not an if, the Democrats return, will they be worse or will [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=624.08s)]
*  they be better? Better? Let's say they return to the middle and they disown identity crisis, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=632.0s)]
*  identity politics, which has turned their party toxic and helped destroy this country, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=637.84s)]
*  nearly destroy it. If they disown that, we should support it. And we should say, you know, a strong [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=642.88s)]
*  and healthy competitive party makes us better too, helps us focus our ideas. But if wokeism returns [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=649.2800000000001s)]
*  as something else, and the Dems love to change the names of things, pronouns, abortion, buildings, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=656.08s)]
*  Marxist ideas, they will, it will come back under a different name. Then you have to ridicule it, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=663.44s)]
*  you have to destroy it. And the Republican Party has to become yet again a sanctuary city [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  for Democrats who are leaving, which are like half the people in Trump's cabinet, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=674.0s)]
*  including Trump himself. The problem that Democrats have, and they're seeing it now, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=678.0s)]
*  is it happened at ESPN, CNN, and MSNBC, when the competent flee, the incompetent, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=685.36s)]
*  who no one will hire and no one wants stays behind. And that concentrates itself further [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=692.64s)]
*  because they can't really go anywhere. So they triple down on their own ideas, their own sunk [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=698.48s)]
*  costs. So the woke gets woken, the aggrieved gets more unhinged, they become what's left. Pretty much [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=703.76s)]
*  you have an unsalvageable party. So I don't think the Dems quite understand the problem that they [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=709.84s)]
*  are in. Identity politics has segregated their party from human connection so that everybody's [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=716.08s)]

*  do with it. We see the problem, it's inside their party. Can their party see that? They've missed [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=727.36s)]
*  all the big stuff. They missed Biden, they missed COVID, they missed the laptop. I think they might [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=732.4000000000001s)]
*  be missing the tumor that's inside their party. And it's malignant. The tumor. The tumor. It's a [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=736.72s)]
*  metastasizing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJR-SioYF68&t=742.24s)]
