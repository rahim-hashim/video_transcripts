# Democrats can't 'fake' being in sports and culture: Jesse Watters
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0)
*  Golf legend Tiger Woods joining President Trump at the White House for a Black History Month event, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=0.0s)]
*  another sign of a mega culture takeover in the sports world. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=4.32s)]
*  One of the Obama pod bros thinks there's a lesson to be learned for the Dems. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump is using sports in a really smart way politically. I think he went to college [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=12.56s)]
*  football games and UFC fights during the campaign. He went to the Super Bowl. He did a loop around [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=16.56s)]
*  the track of the Daytona 500 in his limo over the weekend. It feels like he's creating a bond with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=21.12s)]
*  these audiences that Democrats don't have. How do you think Democrats can be a part of that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=26.96s)]
*  conversation? I can't think of anyone who would go to a game, except for Barack Obama, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=32.08s)]
*  going to NBA games because he genuinely loved the sport. But who else? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=36.72s)]
*  My favorite thing I've ever heard at this table is, who's Tommy Vieter? He worked for Obama. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=41.68s)]
*  And Harold, I go to you for no particular reason. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=48.56s)]
*  There's no doubt people like sports. President Obama played sports he connected with. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=51.68s)]
*  He connected with people on that. President Bush, your old boss, took a loop around the Daytona [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=57.2s)]
*  there as well when the France family agreeing to it. I think it is, anybody that sees, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  I don't know who that guy is, but if he didn't realize that sports and politics go hand in hand, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=69.92s)]
*  where has he been? I thought the smartest thing the president did today was he called the USA [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=76.32s)]
*  hockey team and told them, go beat Canada tonight, as millions of us are going to watch and hopefully [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=82.48s)]
*  no getting fighting like it did last time right from the start. But we'll see. Go USA. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=87.84s)]
*  I was at the national championship game when President Trump came, when LSU played Clemson, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=93.2s)]
*  and I've never heard an ovation. That was right before COVID really hit. I've never heard an [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=99.2s)]
*  ovation like that. So I think it's smart for politicians to go to sporting events and there's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=103.2s)]
*  no doubt. He's not the first one to do it. The biggest sports story during the Biden administration [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=107.44s)]
*  was biological males being allowed to play in women's sports. That was the big sports story. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=112.48s)]
*  Therein lies the difference because you've got Donald Trump, who is an authentic sports person. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  He's always gone to games and to fights and to matches and to races. I've done it with him over [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=124.72s)]
*  the years. I mean, this is what he does. And he's always been someone involved in sports, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=131.84s)]
*  not just in terms of watching, but also when participating. But when you get to the Democrats, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=137.52s)]
*  they want men in women's sports. They're not authentic. And they bring out an assistant high [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=143.28s)]
*  school coach and make it like, you know, they don't understand why he gets booed, Tim Walz, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  at a football game. Donald Trump is authentic. Donald Trump is like a sports person. He plays [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=153.84s)]
*  hard and he works hard and he wins and then he plays hard afterwards. It's not performative, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=160.72s)]
*  like the Democrats, you know, like everybody should get a trophy. No. And that's why, you know, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=168.48s)]
*  there's so much masculinity in terms of, you know, those people who focus on Trump and his [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=173.28s)]
*  connection to sports. It's like, this is the way we want to win. We want to fight. We want to kill [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=179.2s)]
*  him. We're going to win. And maybe I'm wrong. I'm probably going to get crushed for this, but it [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=183.44s)]
*  doesn't feel very partisan to me. Like when he goes, like he's like, is he genuinely enjoys [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=189.04s)]
*  going? Well, you know what they say about Tiger Woods? Terrible place for a picnic. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, the pod bros are funny. It's like they look at these events that where Trump just walks [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  and everyone's crazy. How can we be part of that conversation? Oh, what we should go to sporting [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=207.04s)]
*  events. It's like a big fat jobless sack of whatever walking down the street looks over at [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=213.36s)]
*  a dog park and sees all these beautiful women walking their dogs. That's the ticket. I'll get [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=221.28s)]
*  a dog. I'll get the ladies then. That's how I'll be part of the conversation. No, no, no, no, no. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=227.2s)]
*  See the people get him. He gets the people, the pod bros, they don't get them and they don't get [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=234.08s)]
*  you. So it can never happen. I mean, what would be the corollary for Democrats, Democrat leaders to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=241.6s)]
*  find crowds that they can relate to the Lilith Fair? I don't think that exists anymore. A protest, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=248.32s)]
*  a planned parenthood, you know, a parking lot. The Democratic Party is deliberately fractured. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=254.24s)]
*  You know, they put people in the boxes. So it's really hard to find them all in one spot. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=261.76s)]
*  I'm just thinking about Greg and, you know, like watching Mayor Pete try to go to a football game. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=267.35999999999996s)]
*  Like he just doesn't belong at a football game or Liz Warren trying to go to a basketball game. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=274.96s)]
*  Yeah, they can't even go to a pickleball. I mean, I look at people when I see people, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=280.88s)]
*  first thing I look at if I look at a guy, is he an athlete? And you're either an athlete or you're [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  not an athlete. That's just how I look around. You're not judgmental. He beat up the guy who's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=291.84s)]
*  not an athlete. No, Greg, I'll leave you alone. But if you're not an athlete, like Greg, like we [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=296.64s)]
*  can still hang out and still get along. We're not going to have a catch or anything or go to a game [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=302.0s)]
*  together. But Greg's cool. Thanks. The problem is the problem is the Democrats the last three [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=306.08s)]
*  times nominated two women and an 80 year old who couldn't walk. So they're not going to games. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=312.64s)]
*  They're not relating to this culture. And you're either in the culture or you're not. You can't [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=318.64s)]
*  fake culture. Just ask Rachel Doll was all up next. The king of trolling has spoken. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=322.8s)]
*  President Trump pumping the brakes on congestion pricing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtviDil3H0&t=331.04s)]
