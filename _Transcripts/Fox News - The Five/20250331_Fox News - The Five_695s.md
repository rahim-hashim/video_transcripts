# ‘The Five’ reacts to ‘deranged’ protesters destroying Tesla toy cars
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY)
*  Come on, bring it on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=0.0s)]
*  Bring it on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=7.0s)]
*  Elon Musk rocking a cheese head as he drives the left crazy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=12.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is still shocked by all the hatred. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=29.0s)]
*  Isn't it shocking how much violence and hatred is coming from the left? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=52.0s)]
*  I mean, isn't this supposed to be the party, they claim to be the party of empathy, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=59.0s)]
*  and yet they're burning Teslas and shooting up dealerships and calling for the death of the president and me? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=65.0s)]
*  I'm like, guys, you know, this is insane. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=73.0s)]
*  Like they're totally gone psycho. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=77.0s)]
*  It was inevitable that at least a few Soros operatives would be in the audience. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=79.0s)]
*  Give my regards to George. Say hi to George for me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=85.0s)]
*  But who's actually got time to sing dopey protest songs outside a Tesla dealership? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=90.0s)]
*  According to Business Insider, it's a bunch of liberal boomers who traded their tie dye for NPR tote bags. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=95.0s)]
*  Quote, I attended two Tesla takedown protests. One generation showed up more than others. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=101.0s)]
*  I noticed that the crowds in Ann Arbor and Troy were primarily people over the age of 65, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=107.0s)]
*  white and retired from jobs that depended on public funding as teachers, professors at local universities and social workers. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=112.0s)]
*  Jessica Tarlov, how many Teslas did you torch this week? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=121.0s)]
*  Toys or big ones? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=125.0s)]
*  Both. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=127.0s)]
*  None. I am happier to see the smashing of a toy, though, rather than the real thing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=128.0s)]
*  So I think we're making violent progress in all of that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=134.0s)]
*  And senior citizens are always the most engaged. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=139.0s)]
*  They vote the most and they turn out to protest the most. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=142.0s)]
*  So none of this is really a surprise. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=145.0s)]
*  What was a surprise, though, was hearing Elon Musk. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=148.0s)]
*  He's in Wisconsin because he's trying to buy an election there for a Supreme Court seat. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=151.0s)]
*  And he's saying, you know, where are the Soros operatives? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=156.0s)]
*  But we're basically at Musk operative level. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=159.0s)]
*  So he's the biggest donor by far and away, nearly $20 million given. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=161.0s)]
*  And there's a chart that you can all Google and pull up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=165.0s)]
*  And it shows the other people who have donated, the Democrats down there at the bottom of it with a couple million dollars that they've thrown in there versus Musk. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=168.0s)]
*  And what he's not telling people is that he is in the process of suing to overturn a Wisconsin law that prevents Tesla from operating and owning dealerships there in Wisconsin. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=176.0s)]
*  They only allow third parties to be the ones that are operating them, not the auto manufacturers themselves. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=187.0s)]
*  So it's about his own interest, which is the same thing as getting more of these government contracts and everything that he's accusing the other side of doing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=192.0s)]
*  He's actually doing himself. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=199.0s)]
*  And we're going in circles about this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=201.0s)]
*  The Republican National Committee blind eye again to what Musk is doing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=204.0s)]
*  They were threatening to sue over a group that is handing out ice cream cones to college kids in support of Susan Crawford, who's the Democratic candidate. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=209.0s)]
*  They said that was quote unquote election bribery. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=218.0s)]
*  But Elon Musk handing over literal checks for a million dollars is no big deal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=221.0s)]
*  Oh, citizens United. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=226.0s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=227.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=229.0s)]
*  Judge, I got to tell you, I didn't know that there was something wrong with suing and using the courts. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=230.0s)]
*  And the process if you're prevented from selling a car in a particular area, I think that's the right way to handle it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=238.0s)]
*  I think what the Democrats to sue so that he can sell his car. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=245.0s)]
*  That's what you were referencing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=250.0s)]
*  But this whole thing, I mean, it just goes to show how inauthentic they are. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=252.0s)]
*  I mean, whether it's the singing or the protesting or this guy, the one guy here, he's dancing with a stick that has a swastika sign on it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=257.0s)]
*  So it's like two stepping with a swastika sign. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=266.0s)]
*  I mean, these people are idiots. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=269.0s)]
*  But the thing that concerns me most is the silence on the part of the Democrats. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=271.0s)]
*  To me, silence is acceptance and the acceptance and the rare, rare Democrat who will come out and say, I don't support this kind of thing or the burning or torching or any of this incitement. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=276.0s)]
*  It's too rare. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=290.0s)]
*  But it's what the Democrats do. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=292.0s)]
*  It's a party that's filled with hate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=294.0s)]
*  They don't use the courts. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=296.0s)]
*  They instead, whether it was from the George Floyd riots to the occupation in 2020 in Seattle, Washington, to the Kenosha riots in Wisconsin, where over 100 businesses were destroyed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=298.0s)]
*  The attack on the federal courthouse where it was a nightly riot at a federal courthouse to Inauguration Day where there was police vehicles and businesses set on fire to Antifa attacks at Berkeley. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=313.0s)]
*  Riots at the Supreme Court after the Dobbs decision. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=326.0s)]
*  The Atlantic cops say, I could go on. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=330.0s)]
*  I'm going to bore you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=332.0s)]
*  But this is who the Democrats are. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=333.0s)]
*  They are haters. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=335.0s)]
*  They use violence. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=337.0s)]
*  They don't know how to use the courts in a way to protect their own rights. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=338.0s)]
*  And it is disgusting. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=343.0s)]
*  And the Molotov cocktails and everything they're doing is a violation of law in our institutions. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=345.0s)]
*  And I hope that Miss Jasmine Crockett, I hope that she was happy with her day of action because it didn't seem to come to much at all. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=351.0s)]
*  Greg, were you surprised by the level of protests? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=359.0s)]
*  Shocked? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=363.0s)]
*  Did you not care? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=364.0s)]
*  Well, I was out on Saturday. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=366.0s)]
*  It was a beautiful day in lower Manhattan. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=368.0s)]
*  My family, my large family, we went out. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=370.0s)]
*  We got breakfast. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=373.0s)]
*  We walked through SoHo with the dog and the baby. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=374.0s)]
*  It was really nice. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=377.0s)]
*  It was objectively serene. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=378.0s)]
*  Six blocks away, there was, I think, a protest at one of the Tesla dealerships. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=380.0s)]
*  But I felt a million miles away because it makes me think I like to get as close as I can to this human element like what possesses people to fill up their lives with. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=385.0s)]
*  Politics and and how can their resentment be so easily directed at a fresh cause? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=394.0s)]
*  This is this is transient activism. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=401.0s)]
*  It's one month it was against the police. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=404.0s)]
*  Then it's the Palestinians. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=406.0s)]
*  Then it's climate. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=407.0s)]
*  Now it's Tesla. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=408.0s)]
*  The only thing you can do as a normal human being is kind of just gawk and just walk by. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=410.0s)]
*  I don't there's not a lot of these people, but a different. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=415.0s)]
*  But I think the difference between the left and the right is that I would say since the late 1960s, the the the cry was we're making politics personal, that the things that you vote for are reflective of who you are. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=419.0s)]
*  So no longer could Republicans and Democrats kind of hang out together, play golf together, work together. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=435.0s)]
*  The left, instead of focusing their dislike for the policy, they focused their hate for the person who holds that policy or holds that vote. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=440.0s)]
*  Therefore, if you're a Trump voter, I can hate you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=449.0s)]
*  I can chase you in a subway and take your hat. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=451.0s)]
*  Imagine living like that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=454.0s)]
*  So if somebody doesn't completely agree with you, you have you hold resentment for everybody and it could be easily targeted for anything. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=456.0s)]
*  Someone once said, and I said this on Friday, you hate this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=464.0s)]
*  You hate the sit the sin and not the sinner because the underlying belief is that we're all kind of basket cases. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=467.0s)]
*  We are we're all we all got problems, but you can see the problems. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=473.0s)]
*  You can look at these people and you can go. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=478.0s)]
*  This isn't about Tesla. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=481.0s)]
*  This isn't about the climate. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=483.0s)]
*  This isn't about the police. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=485.0s)]
*  These people have underlying spiritual family emptiness. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=486.0s)]
*  And for them to just so easily fill up that hole with rage with something. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=492.0s)]
*  And as the judge said, it was whether it's the George Floyd riots or even like trans extremism. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=497.0s)]
*  You can see that there is something definitely wrong with them. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=503.0s)]
*  Someone wrote a book about that. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=507.0s)]
*  What it was called. Get it together. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=509.0s)]
*  Don't you find it interesting that once identity politics kind of like fizzled out, we now have a division by class. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=512.0s)]
*  It's now a class warfare thing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=519.0s)]
*  But you also saw very few blacks in these protests. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=522.0s)]
*  And I think because they learned from BLM that it was all BS, that they got burned once. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=525.0s)]
*  So what you see, no matter the age, unwell disheveled loners were crowd sourcing the unwell. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=531.0s)]
*  We're using people who have nothing to lose for whatever purpose it is politically. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=540.0s)]
*  And they just directed at the latest target. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=546.0s)]
*  Well, to Greg's point is the old saying goes when the only tool you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=549.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what they're doing. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=556.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is a smart guy. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=558.0s)]
*  I don't know why he's surprised about this behavior from the left. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=559.0s)]
*  This has been their standard operating procedure for decades. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=562.0s)]
*  Going back to the Weather Underground, which then got into the university system, which then trained all these people who are now older and retired to go out. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=565.0s)]
*  And that violence is OK so long as it's for the right political cause. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=573.0s)]
*  But there's two types of protesters you're seeing. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=577.0s)]
*  You're seeing the retired white boomers who are taking their last stand of activism. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=579.0s)]
*  But then you're also seeing the trained professional agitators who are getting paid to do this, who are setting these dealerships on fire, throwing Molotov cocktails, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=585.0s)]
*  getting violent, doing more than keying a car, putting gum on a Tesla. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=594.0s)]
*  And the only way this is going to stop is when there are consequences for their behavior. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=598.0s)]
*  So in states like Florida, it's a felony to to vandalize a vehicle. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=602.0s)]
*  So people are learning a hard lesson there. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=607.0s)]
*  And in states or cities where the prosecutors are soft on crime, the federal government and DOJ, Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kashrutellev said we will come after you and throw the book and we'll treat this like domestic terrorism because that's exactly what it is. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=609.0s)]
*  One thing I want to say about the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=623.0s)]
*  You know, Elon has put money into that race, but Susan Crawford has also gotten tons of money from outside groups. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=626.0s)]
*  And she's openly said she needs to win that seat because she wants to take away two congressional seats by redistricting from Republicans. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=632.0s)]
*  So she's doing it for her own political ambitions, not to uphold the law. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=640.0s)]
*  So you can argue that Elon has his interests, but so did the Democrats in Wisconsin. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=644.0s)]
*  I'm just saying he's by him victim blaming up there and saying like I'm the innocent guy here and it's George Soros that's doing this. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=648.0s)]
*  That it's denying the fact that he's the single biggest money influence in this election. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=654.0s)]
*  And there was they also tried to be open about the money and not the reason for it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=658.0s)]
*  Also, he doesn't get up there and say, oh, you know, I can't my my Tesla dealerships can't operate here. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=663.0s)]
*  I can't run them. He's not talking about that at all. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=669.0s)]
*  And Susan Crawford, I don't know. That's like her personal goal. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=671.0s)]
*  She's going to run for the congressional seat or she understands. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=674.0s)]
*  She has said we need to take the control so we can redistrict so we can take away Republican seats. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=677.0s)]
*  And Keem Jeffries also has confirmed it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=682.0s)]
*  All right. That was really interesting. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0ahxvpEzY&t=684.0s)]
