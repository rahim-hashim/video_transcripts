# ‘The Five’: Crockett downplays Democrat extremism
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78)
*  Greg, domestic terrorists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=0.0s)]
*  This is something, the idea here is that political violence seems to, and today exists, extremely [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=3.06s)]
*  on the left compared to the right. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=9.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think you had one day, one bad day for the right, and they had to like milk it [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=11.1s)]
*  for all it's worth, commissions, you name it, throw everybody in jail. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=15.16s)]
*  They've done this every single day since like 1963. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=18.7s)]
*  They haven't stopped. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=23.76s)]
*  And keep it, and think about all the crap that the Dems are doing now, the singing, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=24.76s)]
*  the shouting, flying to El Salvador, storming ICE. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=28.44s)]
*  They've replaced law and order with performance art. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=32.64s)]
*  The problem is, like all performance art, no one buys it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=36.2s)]
*  It's one and done, it's self-serving, it doesn't offer any service to the community that they [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  claim to help. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=46.36s)]
*  No one really remembers Van Hollen going to El Salvador. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=48.3s)]
*  I'm sure he would like people to forget about it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  I won't. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=55.24s)]
*  Somebody should put out an Amber Alert for Van Hollen. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=56.24s)]
*  Where is that douchebag? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=58.64s)]
*  That guy wasted what, how many weeks of our lives being a self-righteous jerk? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  Sorry, I was going through all the words in my head and I came up with jerk. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=64.6s)]
*  But this is all, you know what this is? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=69.12s)]
*  This is all traced back to the guilty white liberal and the soft bigotry of no expectations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=71.2s)]
*  They believe you cannot be held accountable for your actions. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=76.84s)]
*  You're almost too childlike to be expected to conform to civilized behavior. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  This is why you have the affluent white female libs, offals, defending extra rights for male [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=84.32s)]
*  perverts, gang members and psychopaths. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Imagine if any, a lot of women there went into this ice structure alone without any [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  security. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=96.55999999999999s)]
*  What might happen there? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=97.55999999999999s)]
*  They'll never find out because they have security. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=98.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's American men, mothers and wives who have said enough. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Americans are generally pretty laid back until they're not and then they've had enough. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=106.35999999999999s)]
*  You elected Trump, the adults enter the room. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=112.36s)]
*  These are children. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=115.32s)]
*  This is a tantrum. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=116.32s)]
*  They expect us to respect that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=117.32s)]
*  We won't. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=119.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=120.24s)]
*  Katie, you talk about violence. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=121.24s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember when police officers around the country were being assassinated. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=122.24s)]
*  Five in Dallas at a mostly peaceful protest and now you have Democrat members of Congress [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=128.64s)]
*  going on there. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=133.26s)]
*  I was assaulted. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=134.26s)]
*  I mean, they looked real assaulted to me. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=135.26s)]
*  I mean, you know, roughed up grandma there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=136.56s)]
*  It's a show. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=139.72s)]
*  Again, what are the Democrats' priorities? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=141.08s)]
*  So the mayor of Newark oversees a city that right now has a huge problem with their airport. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=143.0s)]
*  It's an international hub. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=149.16s)]
*  He's not dealing with that problem. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=150.76s)]
*  It's a city that has a higher than usual crime rate compared to the national average. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=152.76s)]
*  And what is he doing? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=157.84s)]
*  He's showing up at a federal facility, trespassing, breaking in and getting arrested for show. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=158.84s)]
*  And then the congressmen who are in women who are there with him go out to the cameras [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=165.36s)]
*  and claim that they're assaulted. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=169.56s)]
*  Well, it's not assault when you break in to federal property and it is a federal crime [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=171.16s)]
*  to trespass without permission. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=177.52s)]
*  And I think if you look at the way that certain people have been prosecuted for trespassing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=180.4s)]
*  on federal property and Democrats continue to say the law is the law, that maybe they [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=185.58s)]
*  should be prosecuted in the same way as the insurrectionists. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=191.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=195.32s)]
*  Harold. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=196.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=197.32s)]
*  I could hear your voice reading this topic saying, I think political violence on both [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  sides should be condemned. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=201.76s)]
*  Because I know who you are and I know where you think you're a very level-headed guy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=202.76s)]
*  Well, you should be there too. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm proud of that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't want to give you that softball. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  You are a Democrat and you hear Jasmine Crockett kind of just punt the responsibility. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  And so whatever you think is happening on the right or isn't happening on the right, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=216.04s)]
*  the left probably should take a stand against not just what we saw at the size facility [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  but what we're seeing in these protests on college campuses. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=223.68s)]
*  Honestly, if words are hurtful the way the left would say, they're saying some really [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  – they're being very violent. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  You finished? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=234.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=235.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=236.24s)]
*  I'm going to believe in bringing people together. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=237.24s)]
*  And for the life of me, I don't think – you can laugh. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=239.32s)]
*  No, I knew that's where you would go. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=242.8s)]
*  I think there's a dearth of – [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=243.8s)]
*  I've been to his hot tub parties. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=244.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=246.4s)]
*  I think there's a dearth of that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=247.4s)]
*  When you see violence in politics, the instinct shouldn't be to say, they do it more than [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=250.68s)]
*  we do. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=255.28s)]
*  It doesn't matter if it's done 90 percent by Democrats and 10 percent by Republicans [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=256.28s)]
*  or vice versa. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=260.52s)]
*  I don't have a thing in front of me to tell you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=261.52s)]
*  I do know the country. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=263.08s)]
*  We have a history in our country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=264.32s)]
*  And some of it is a proud history of being really – having hard, contentious conversations [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=266.32s)]
*  about really, really almost intractable issues, some of them which still afflict us today [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=271.2s)]
*  as we try to solve them. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=276.02s)]
*  And sometimes it turns into silliness. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=277.55999999999995s)]
*  It turns like I don't agree when federal officials tell you you shouldn't do something, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=279.4s)]
*  you shouldn't do it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  And I give you no leniency because of your political leanings. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=286.0s)]
*  Two, you said it well, Katie. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=289.72s)]
*  In New Jersey – it's not just in New Jersey, it's in a lot of places – there's an air [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=291.8s)]
*  traffic control issue. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=295.36s)]
*  That's where every politician, whether you're a Republican or Democrat, should be trying [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=297.2s)]
*  their hardest to fight. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=301.04s)]
*  You have people that can't pay their rent, can't pay their mortgage. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=302.28s)]
*  You have small business people worried about how to set prices. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=305.12s)]
*  What do they have to fire people, whether or not they're going to have inventory in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=307.52s)]
*  their stores. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=311.12s)]
*  That's where the focus should be. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=312.12s)]
*  So violence should be condemned. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=314.0s)]
*  Regardless of who commits it – and I don't know if one party has committed more of it [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=315.88s)]
*  than not in our almost 250-year history – but I know one thing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  Hard, tough, political, contentious conversations are fine as long as our aim is to try to solve [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=323.0s)]
*  things. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  But this is not. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  Whether it's January 6th, whether it's this, whether it's any of the other examples [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  that we talk about here today, the focus should be on bringing people together and solving [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=333.28s)]
*  problems. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=336.64s)]
*  That may sound corny, but I don't mind being corny today. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=337.64s)]
*  Can I say one more thing just about the people they're defending in this ICE facility? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=339.2s)]
*  There are people in there who have actually assaulted people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=343.44s)]
*  People who have actually committed sexual assault, other kinds of violence against American [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=346.52s)]
*  citizens, and the Democrats who stormed and breached the premises are trying to protect [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  them. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  They should let them hang with them for a few hours. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  Rosanna, it's not just this ICE facility. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=360.35999999999996s)]
*  Not far from here, Brooklyn University had – I guess protesters thought they were going [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  to make an encampment. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=368.08s)]
*  And the university said, no, we're not having that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=369.08s)]
*  They call an NYPD. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=370.92s)]
*  They say, come in and clean this out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=371.92s)]
*  They do. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=373.52s)]
*  Protesters get violent. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  Next thing you know, they're claiming that they're being assaulted. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  And all the police are doing is exactly what their job is. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=378.28s)]
*  Is this leaning towards another anti-police movement? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=381.24s)]
*  Because that's what's going to happen. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=384.92s)]
*  They're going to get violent in these protests. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=386.32s)]
*  We're seeing it, Antifa, that kind of thing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=388.0s)]
*  Now it's the Antifa. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=389.92s)]
*  It seems like the police, especially in New York City, have been very measured in dealing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=391.56s)]
*  with these campus protests. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=396.28s)]
*  Whether it's at Columbia University or Brooklyn, where it happened just a few days ago. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=398.78s)]
*  And by the way, some of those protesters defacing property all over the place and encouraging, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=404.02s)]
*  well, a little bit of aggression. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=410.78s)]
*  They want to see something happen. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=414.06s)]
*  You know, with the Newark mayor being arrested today, I keep thinking about New York City's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=415.97999999999996s)]
*  mayor, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=422.29999999999995s)]
*  And the mayor of Newark and how different they are. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=423.9s)]
*  So the mayor of Newark storms a federal facility knowing full well he probably will get arrested. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=426.34s)]
*  Hoping to get arrested because he wants to have some kind of stance on the migrant situation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=433.14s)]
*  We have the mayor of New York City who basically got arrested, he said, because he went to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=439.34s)]
*  Washington and shamed at the time President Biden for his stance on how he was handling [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=445.26s)]
*  the migrant situation in New York City. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=450.84s)]
*  In fact, Mayor Adams is in D.C. today talking to President Trump, and I'm sure the migrant [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=454.18s)]
*  situation is on their agenda. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=460.82s)]
*  Well, here's the hoping that everyone that is considering political violence doesn't. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=463.97999999999996s)]
*  But they have every right to go there. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  They were not allowed to go in. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=472.21999999999997s)]
*  I think they break in. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=473.21999999999997s)]
*  Oversight function of the Democrats and Republicans in Congress is something to do. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=474.21999999999997s)]
*  Sure, that's different than breaking in. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  No, then they should have been arrested. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  You should be held accountable if you committed that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=479.21999999999997s)]
*  I agree with you wholeheartedly. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  They have every right to try to do that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=481.65999999999997s)]
*  They just said they give them a tour. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=482.74s)]
*  They don't do that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=483.74s)]
*  They were wrong. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=484.74s)]
*  There is going to be no accountability. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=485.74s)]
*  They're going to raise money off getting arrested and then no charges are going to be set free [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=486.74s)]
*  and they're going to win. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leivpM2Kr78&t=490.1s)]
