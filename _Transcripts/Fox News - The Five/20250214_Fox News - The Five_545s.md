# ‘The Five’: Democrats are struggling to win back men
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY)
*  Democrats need to pair. Democrats, because I was going to say it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats need to grow a pair if they want to start winning again. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=4.16s)]
*  According to a new poll, liberal women are the most unhappy and lonely group. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=8.08s)]
*  Only 12 percent of them claim to be completely satisfied with their lives. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=12.44s)]
*  And it's because all the manly men have flocked to President Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=17.0s)]
*  The Republican Party is capitalized on masculinity [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  thanks to Democrats obsession with catering to wimpy beta males. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=24.52s)]
*  Clay Travis summed it up perfectly. Watch this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  Trump's like a grandpa. Well, hold on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=32.8s)]
*  Yeah, Trump took a bullet in his ear and immediately stood up and said, fight, fight, fight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=36.2s)]
*  Every man in America and most of the women out here were impressed by that, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=42.72s)]
*  even if the women won't admit it. She's shaking her head strong. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And and second part of this, basically summing it up, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=51.04s)]
*  Democrats for men are and Republicans are. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=55.72s)]
*  Ah, perhaps the left should take some notes from our Secretary of Defense. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=62.04s)]
*  Pete Hegseth was up at the crack of dawn working out with U.S. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=66.68s)]
*  forces in Poland despite freezing cold temperatures. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=70.32s)]
*  All right. So if I'll start with you, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=75.08s)]
*  if progressive Kennedy ideology is supposed to empower women, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=79.28s)]
*  why does it seem that so many of them are feeling miserable and alone and unhappy? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  Judge, you are a self-made woman and you know what that takes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=89.64s)]
*  It takes hard work and self-belief and empowerment. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  You know, it comes by the grace of God, but it comes from within. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=97.64000000000001s)]
*  So that means you are constantly looking at your life. You're going inside. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=101.56s)]
*  You're trying to figure out what will it take for me to do better? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  How can I work harder? How can I be more effective? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  And when you become a mom, it gives you even more of those refined superpowers. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=111.32s)]
*  But when you are conditioned to think that the outside world is the thing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=116.0s)]
*  that controls your life and controls, you know, this empowerment center, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=120.36s)]
*  then you are now the the object of victimhood. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=125.0s)]
*  So you now think that it is the external world that is creating your reality. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=129.12s)]
*  So you are constantly mad at the external world instead of thinking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=135.12s)]
*  of yourself as an empowered individual with agency who has choices to make [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=140.08s)]
*  based on, you know, her own volition and her own needs instead of the world. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=146.08s)]
*  Just screw in the pooch on my behalf. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  Ah, like that analogy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  If you were advising a Democratic candidate, Harold, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=155.96s)]
*  would you tell them to man up and start talking about issues like crime, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=159.12s)]
*  economic stability, opportunity? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I am a Democrat, so I do say those things to Democrats. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=166.36s)]
*  If you were advising a Democrat. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=169.96s)]
*  If I were to say, I would do that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=171.28s)]
*  So I like Clay. I think that's a little oversimplification. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=172.84s)]
*  I think as we look back at this last race, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  voters did what they did every time in a presidential race. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=179.4s)]
*  They make a basic calculation about who can best make their lives better. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=182.68s)]
*  Are they better off than they were a few years before? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=187.84s)]
*  If someone's running as an incumbent, and though Kamala Harris was not an incumbent, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=190.44000000000003s)]
*  she was essentially running as an incumbent on a record that she had built as vice president. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  Had Democrats had a clear and persuasive answer on how to secure the border, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=200.56s)]
*  how to tackle and reduce inflation, if we'd applied common sense to cultural issues, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  we did it with abortion, but we didn't do it with little boys and little girls in bathrooms and sports. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=212.72s)]
*  There might have been a different outcome to the race. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not I'm not as much caught up in some of the language and manning up [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=219.76s)]
*  and all of those kind of things. I mean, I get I think I get what they're saying. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=223.28s)]
*  But if we again, we find ourselves six months from today from today and prices are not coming down [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=226.6s)]
*  and people don't feel more confident about the country's future. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=231.4s)]
*  Politics has a funny way of the pendulum coming back. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=235.24s)]
*  But unless we do these things, Judge, I don't mean to minimize or belittle this point or this moment. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=238.2s)]
*  Unless Democrats take note of where we are and what the country is expecting from politicians, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=242.96s)]
*  we won't find ourselves in a majority anytime soon. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=249.44s)]
*  We have to do that to win back the confidence of America. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=251.76s)]
*  You know, what Kennedy was talking about, Jesse, is is so true. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=255.6s)]
*  And my question is social media. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=259.36s)]
*  I mean, how much of this is social media, how the liberal women are kind of plugged into this toxic online spaces [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=262.36s)]
*  that that fuel the victimhood and the anxiety? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=270.32s)]
*  Well, it reinforces the victimhood and the anxiety when you stare at that screen all day. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  But the Democrats haven't nominated a real man since Bill Clinton. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  Then they nominated Kerry, who was into kitesurfing and bicycling and Botox and married an heiress. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=282.44s)]
*  And then they had Obama, indecisive, aloof, not going to get into his marriage, not my role. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=289.04s)]
*  Good for you. Then they nominated Hillary Clinton. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=295.36s)]
*  No man wanted to vote for Hillary Clinton. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  No man would be proud to vote for Hillary Clinton. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  And then Joe Biden, he was falling. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=305.32s)]
*  He invited an invasion into this country and he was scared of a virus. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=308.4s)]
*  And then they put up Kamala and even black men were like, I've had it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=312.44s)]
*  So at this point, too, you get these cultural currents coming in with the Me Too movement [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=315.84s)]
*  that made a lot of men scared and submissive. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  And then the pandemic, which made them conformist and lazy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=323.55999999999995s)]
*  And then Dei just made them apologetic. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=327.32s)]
*  So then you have society conditioning men's testosterone down. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=330.0s)]
*  And women see men with low testosterone and they resent that because they don't like that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=335.08s)]
*  So men just tried to get lucky by being feminists. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=340.32s)]
*  And that's even more of a turn off. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=344.36s)]
*  And it's just a vicious cycle. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=346.08s)]
*  But the final straw was the transgender mania, because real men, they know this destroys [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=347.88s)]
*  their families, it hurts their children, their sons and daughters. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=354.96s)]
*  But they still submitted to it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=358.0s)]
*  And that's when the Democratic Party broke man. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=360.84s)]
*  And then there was a revolt. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=363.88s)]
*  You got unions, you got blacks, Hispanics, millennials. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=365.04s)]
*  They're like, I am out of here. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=368.08s)]
*  And that left who? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=369.52s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, Tam Pon Tim, the mayor, Pete. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=370.76s)]
*  And so everybody was like, I don't want to be at this table where it's Tam Pon Tim and a bunch [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=377.56s)]
*  of angry women screaming, we're going to go over here. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  We're going to tell jokes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=384.92s)]
*  We're going to get things done. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=386.24s)]
*  Just don't give us any grief. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=387.6s)]
*  And that's where we are now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=388.92s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=390.52s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=391.24s)]
*  Greg, wrap it up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=391.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is obvious that men are driven by the idea of security and protection. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=394.6s)]
*  It's why we are always interested in self-defense, action movies, Second Amendment, Law and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=400.0s)]
*  Order, Secure Border. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=405.92s)]
*  But Jesse, as much as it pains me, is right that the breaking the breaking point was trans. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  And when you get in the argument of trans, you go, it's a tiny population. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=414.92s)]
*  Well, then why is the needs of a tiny population being placed on us? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=418.64s)]
*  And why are we supposed to remain silent and sympathetic to something that is so clearly [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=424.36s)]
*  wrong? What we noticed among women and women are tend to be the tendency to be more [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=428.6s)]
*  compassionate and empathetic were being exploited by autogynophiles, men that like to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  dress up as women as a fetish. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=439.0s)]
*  And then then they preyed upon the compassion of women to defend them. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=440.4s)]
*  And other. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=444.36s)]
*  And it was just a matter of time where men were like, going, you know what? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=445.32s)]
*  This this just isn't right, you know? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=449.4s)]
*  And then suddenly you looked at all the policies and the attitudes and it made actual men [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=452.32s)]
*  feel unwanted. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  And there's one thing about men, they don't like being where they aren't wanted. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=459.44s)]
*  So it wasn't like the Republicans really had to court them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  They were being uncorted by the Democrats. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=466.84s)]

*  You can still hang around here. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  But then what kind of man hangs around like that? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=474.64000000000004s)]

*  you don't see heralds, the people you see are the David Hoggs. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=481.12s)]
*  I don't believe that all Democrats are David Hoggs. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  I would like to think there are more Harold Ford's, but we just don't see you only see [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=488.20000000000005s)]

*  But but I guess my point is I think the Democrat Party and this is my advice I would [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=496.28000000000003s)]

*  out to the arms of the Republicans. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV7fwvYYcY&t=527.28s)]
