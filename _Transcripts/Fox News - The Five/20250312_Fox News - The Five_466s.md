# Gutfeld: Why do Dems always choose the worst hills to die on?
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8)
*  The campus caliphate popping off as Democrats rally around the arrested mastermind of those [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=0.0s)]
*  anti-Semitic protests that terrorized Jewish students across Ivy Leagues last year. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=12.0s)]
*  His name Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=17.28s)]
*  He's the Israel-hating former Columbia student who's been whipped up brainwashing pro-Hamas [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  students as they ransack buildings and set up encampments. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=25.76s)]
*  Trump yanking his student visa, ICE arresting him and holding him in a facility in Louisiana [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=29.24s)]
*  as they looked to deport him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  But a judge blocked his deportation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=35.64s)]
*  Fox has learned Khalil was previously investigated as a potential national security threat. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  Investigators also found anti-Semitic and hateful posts on his social media. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=44.8s)]
*  President Trump putting other agitators on notice. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=49.32s)]
*  I think we ought to get them all out of the country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  They're troublemakers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=55.44s)]
*  They're agitators. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=56.44s)]
*  They don't love our country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=57.44s)]
*  We ought to get them the hell out. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=59.2s)]
*  I watched them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=60.28s)]
*  I watched tapes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=61.28s)]
*  Specifically, I watched tapes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=62.28s)]
*  And you can have them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=64.48s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=66.76s)]
*  You can have them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=67.76s)]
*  And you can have the rest of them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=68.76s)]
*  And shocker, the Democrats are siding with the pro-terror agitators. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=71.08s)]
*  If you believe in constitutional rights, you understand that they're targeting this person [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=75.68s)]
*  and everyone knows he has been very vocal against the genocide of the Palestinian people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=79.64s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=84.76s)]
*  And they're targeting him and refusing him constitutional rights. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=86.4s)]
*  Who's next? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=90.2s)]
*  So Jessica, is this one of those things where like the whole country wants this guy booted [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=91.2s)]
*  and the Democrats stick up for him? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=96.12s)]
*  I'm not sure it's quite that extreme. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  I have seen conservatives, I think Ann Coulter wrote, I basically want to deport everyone, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=100.72s)]
*  but I need to know what the crime is that he committed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=105.48s)]
*  And the secretary of state does have the power to revoke a green card if there's a legal [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  basis for doing that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  I think they're going to need to prove their case, but I certainly don't want this guy [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  to become the poster child for the Democratic Party. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=117.72s)]
*  I saw the Senate Judiciary Dems tweeted out a picture and saying like, free him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=120.6s)]
*  That seems extreme. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  And this guy, he is aligned, chosen to align himself with a group that is holding Americans [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  hostage. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=133.12s)]
*  And that feels like a national security threat to me. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  And that certainly feels like someone who doesn't really want to be part of the American [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=137.92s)]
*  fabric. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  And he is married to an American, she is eight months pregnant. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=143.3s)]
*  That is a that's serious. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=145.94s)]
*  He's part of a community here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=147.18s)]
*  Well, he he is he's married to an American that matters, Judge. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=149.38000000000002s)]
*  You'll hear from me. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=154.94s)]
*  Don't worry about me. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=155.94s)]
*  Well, go ahead. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=156.94s)]
*  OK, the judge says you'll hear from her. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=157.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=159.5s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=160.5s)]
*  He's been in this country two years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=161.5s)]
*  He's not part of the American family. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=162.66000000000003s)]
*  Let's fabric. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=164.74s)]
*  So let's start with that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=165.74s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil is subject to deportation on many grounds and not the least of which is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=167.06s)]
*  the section of law that Marco Rubio, as secretary of state, has the power to deport him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=174.06s)]
*  And that is it is INA Section 237, subdivision A4C. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=179.78s)]
*  And all that says is you don't have to be convicted of a crime. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=187.16s)]
*  You don't even have to be charged with a crime, Jessica. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=190.94s)]
*  The secretary of state has the power to remove this guy, whether he's got a green card, whether [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=193.92s)]
*  he's got a visa, whether he's, as he alleges, is a permanent legal resident because he married [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=198.84s)]
*  an American. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=204.2s)]
*  None of that matters under this section of law. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=205.2s)]
*  And let's be real clear about something else. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=208.56s)]
*  They could have done it on other statues as well because of his support for a foreign [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=211.04s)]
*  terrorist organization. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=216.5s)]
*  He could be he could be deported for that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=218.4s)]
*  And all this nonsense that's going on in the Southern District of New York where Mahmoud [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=220.48s)]
*  Khalil says that habeas corpus, his body should be brought to New York out of Louisiana. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=225.84s)]
*  He has no right to be brought to New York. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=233.4s)]
*  This is this is theater because under this INA statute, it is a non justiciable issue. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=235.96s)]
*  That means that the decision is made outside of the civil courts. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=244.76s)]
*  So let's not kid ourselves and make this guy out to be some hero while the Democrats [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=249.24s)]
*  couldn't even crack a smile for D.J. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=254.0s)]
*  Daniels or Jocelyn Nungary. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=256.8s)]
*  This guy's a bad ombre, Dana, but Colombia, they could have done a lot more than they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=261.08s)]
*  did when this thing broke for them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=264.68s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=267.04s)]
*  I mean, and they paid a price. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=268.04s)]
*  They won. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=269.04s)]
*  They lost the four hundred million dollars or four hundred million dollars. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=270.04s)]
*  But they also the president had to resign. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=272.2s)]
*  And also what they've lost in terms of credibility and the students who are upset, they don't [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=275.8s)]
*  want to go there anymore. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=281.12s)]
*  The alumni who don't want to be a part of it anymore. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=282.12s)]
*  The reputational damage of the school. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=283.76s)]
*  They are in really bad. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=286.4s)]
*  They have really bad problems. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm fascinated to watch this legal argument play out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=291.76s)]
*  I just don't even pretend to be one on TV. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=292.76s)]
*  But I would say this from a comm standpoint, the White House and the Justice Department [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=295.4s)]
*  are saying they have legitimate national security concerns. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=298.76s)]
*  And to the extent that they can, they should show their work a little bit more. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  Give Caroline Levitt, the White House press secretary, just a little bit more so that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  she can explain that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=310.2s)]
*  Now, we're going to get that tomorrow morning in the hearing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  But if you're going to put her out there, she's going to have to have some more information. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=313.4s)]
*  And she deserves to get that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=317.52s)]
*  And press secretaries don't leak. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=319.0s)]
*  So don't worry about that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=320.52s)]
*  The other thing is from a political perspective, it's kind of fascinating to see these Senate [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  Democrats who they couldn't even say Lakin Riley's name. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  And now you have to leave, who just put out a tweet that Kate just sent to me. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=328.92s)]
*  She said she's joining 13 colleagues in a letter. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=332.88s)]
*  And 13! [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=337.44s)]
*  I would be so embarrassed. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=338.76s)]
*  I would never even admit that there were only 13 people that agreed with me. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=339.76s)]
*  Greg, it would be interesting to see if this guy got any money to foment these protests [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=343.12s)]
*  and who we got the money from. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=347.44s)]
*  Follow the money. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=349.08s)]
*  I just came up with that phrase. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=350.08s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=351.08s)]
*  Could be the name for a show as well. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=352.08s)]
*  If they deport him, they've got to send him to Gaza. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=353.56s)]
*  Don't they? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  Don't they? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  But it goes back to why do the Democrats always choose the worst hills to die on? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=358.44s)]
*  They can't see the forest for the activists. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=365.24s)]
*  They can't see the big picture either because they've got some kind of obvious derangement [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  syndrome. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=372.24s)]
*  They hate the West. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBrGXh9SPD8&t=373.24s)]
