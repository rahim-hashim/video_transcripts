# ‘The Five’: The Bidens take on ‘The View’
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc)
*  The elderly man with a poor memory is on a rehab tour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Biden escaping the nursing home this morning and shuffling his way over for a little chit chat [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=3.68s)]
*  with the lovely ladies of the view. Watch this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=9.68s)]
*  Oh, does they like you? They miss you today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=12.08s)]
*  Yeah, they miss you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=14.56s)]
*  I miss being here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=17.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=18.64s)]
*  I'm actually interviewing for a job as a cameraman. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=21.04s)]
*  We just marked last week Trump's 100th day in office. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=23.12s)]
*  Now he's calling for investigations and claiming the pardons are void and vacants. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=30.08s)]
*  Oh, he's vacant. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=36.08s)]
*  Why is he so fixated on you and blaming you for everything? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=37.36s)]
*  I beat him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Did you? Old man Joe also grumbling about the coup and the veep who failed him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  I think she's first rate, but we have a lot of really good candidates as well. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=51.36s)]
*  Why do you think the vice president lost and were you surprised? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=56.16s)]
*  No. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=60.4s)]
*  I wasn't surprised. They went the route of the sexist route, the whole route. I mean, this is a woman. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=61.6s)]
*  Some have even argued that leaving the race and endorsing your vice president, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=68.88s)]
*  Vice President Harris, over 100 days before the election hampered her campaign. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=74.4s)]
*  There were still six full months. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=80.0s)]
*  Six full months, she was fully funded. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  Tom Shalhoub never looked so good. But enough with the malarkey. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=86.0s)]
*  Let's bring out the real former president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=89.68s)]
*  The people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  He put in a full day and then at night he would, I'd be in bed, you know, reading my book. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=97.12s)]
*  And he was still on the phone reading his briefings, working with staff. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was nonstop. I did not create a cocoon around him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=109.28s)]
*  I didn't have him, you know, sequestered in some place. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=113.68s)]
*  Is that hurtful to you when they were describing you as Lady Macbeth? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=117.04s)]
*  Yes, it was very hurtful. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  Joey, it's actually Lady Macbiden. All right, correct yourself, please. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  It's Dr. Lady Macbiden. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=126.56s)]
*  Yeah, Dr. Lady Macbiden. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=127.68s)]
*  Joe Biden looked so upset there. Was it because he thought that Jill was talking about another man? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=129.52s)]
*  I thought he looked asleep. He just kind of had the old man's stairs. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=136.08s)]
*  He was just looking, he saw something, he just focused in on it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=140.32s)]
*  He's like, don't fall out of the chair. Don't do it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=142.8s)]
*  That's easy to make fun of. I guess when you get out of the presidency, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  you're supposed to go give speeches for $100,000 at a time and enjoy it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=149.76s)]
*  I don't think he can do that. I don't think there's an audience for it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=154.16s)]
*  Maybe for Jill, though, which is kind of funny. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, that's interesting because there is talk that they're going to sell the his and hers [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=160.08s)]
*  autobiographies for $30 million. That's half what the Obamas got. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  But that hers actually might be a little bit more interesting because [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  she kept a diary every day. What is it with the Bidens in the diary? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=173.84s)]
*  Those two are definitely writing it. It's not ghostwritten at all. Not a chance. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=180.72s)]
*  Now, if you're a man, a real man, Kennedy, the view should not love you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=185.84s)]
*  The view doesn't like real men. So if the fact that Biden goes on the view and they adore him [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=193.28s)]
*  says a lot about Joe Biden. And I'm feeling like Dr. Jill is like Jordan Hudson, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=198.16s)]
*  like Belichick's girlfriend, constantly running interference, constantly interrupting everybody, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=203.68s)]
*  managing him. And it seems like Biden feels like O.J. felt after the trial. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=209.2s)]
*  It's like everybody knows you're bad. Everybody knows you did it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=214.88s)]
*  No one wants to be seen with you. This is the only show in this country [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=218.88s)]
*  that will sit down and actually like Joe Biden. That's what it says. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=223.2s)]
*  He says that he knew she was going to lose, Kamala Harris. Well, then why did he bow out? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=227.76s)]
*  If you knew she's going to lose, why didn't you stay and fight if you thought you could have [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=234.32s)]
*  beat Trump? So that was a lie. Or if you knew she was going to lose because the country's sexist, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  why did you pick her as vice president? Because you were supposed to hand off this thing to the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=243.6s)]
*  vice president. So why would you pick someone who you knew the country hated and was going to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=247.84s)]
*  reject? Also, does it make any sense? When Bush left office, he was also unpopular, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=253.04s)]
*  not this unpopular, but unpopular, but he left with class and dignity. He said, I knew what I [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=258.4s)]
*  needed to do with the war on terror. I knew it was right. I stuck to my guns and will let history [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=263.76s)]
*  judge. This guy is disgraceful. He should just never go back on television ever again. He was [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=268.88s)]
*  already diminished, but his legacy is just, it's even worse now. All right. So Dana, he has hired [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=278.56s)]
*  a crisis PR person, a political insider he used to work with who has now shifted gears as you do, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=285.92s)]
*  because you always have to have a revenue stream when you leave politics. So what is the point of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=292.72s)]
*  them going out there? Is it just to craft a narrative against the multitude of books that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=298.24s)]
*  are coming out talking about his cognitive decline? I think certainly they have, they have [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=303.68s)]
*  a lot of costs, right? In the post presidency. And they're not getting the invitations to give [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=310.96s)]
*  the speeches that Joey's talking about, obviously. And remember he gave one speech and it was not [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=316.72s)]
*  good. And I can see why the Democrats are somewhat vocal now about not needing to hear from them [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=322.72s)]
*  again, but they are convinced that they need to. And the guy that they hired, great guy, like nice [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=329.52s)]
*  guy. In fact, I think his mom watches the five. So hello to you, Mrs. Mayor. But I kind of feel [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=334.4s)]
*  it's like Groundhog Day with Joe Biden. Like every time he comes up, they see a shadow and then it's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=339.84s)]
*  another six weeks of bad press. And then Jill acts like the last soldier on the island after the war [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=343.84s)]
*  is over. She's like, no, actually everything's still fine. Everything's great. We're still [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=350.32s)]
*  fighting. Everything's good. There were 50 sources who were talking to the press saying how bad it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=353.68s)]
*  was. And they weren't Republican sources. There were sources inside the White House and in and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=359.36s)]
*  around the campaign. So I think that it's not off to a great start and it probably will end even [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=363.36s)]
*  worse. Yes. And it was, it was almost hard watching Dr. Jill intervene when she was like, did those, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=369.6s)]
*  you know, to Dana's point, did those people live in the White House? They did not. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3FXVOaFUc&t=376.16s)]
