# Gutfeld calls liberals a ’sieve,’ says they ‘hold nothing of value’
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M)
*  More protests against Elon Musk happening in D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=0.0s)]
*  as the left takes aim at his electric car company, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=3.14s)]
*  the NYPD arresting dozens over the weekend [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=5.94s)]
*  after they took over and shut down [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=8.44s)]
*  a Tesla showroom here in New York, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=10.4s)]
*  with the glass door of the facility [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=12.48s)]
*  appearing to be shattered. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=13.84s)]
*  And that's on top of other violence erupting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=15.68s)]
*  at other Tesla locations, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=18.34s)]
*  with reports of Molotov cocktails, graffiti, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=20.04s)]
*  and even gunfire breaking out on dealership lots. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=22.98s)]
*  Musk responding to the violence [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=26.26s)]
*  while speaking to Larry Kudlow. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=27.72s)]
*  When people criticize, say, what Doge is doing, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=30.46s)]
*  we say, well, which part specifically? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=32.4s)]
*  Because we put all of the actions of the Doge team [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=34.2s)]
*  on the Doge.gov website and on the Doge Handle on X. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=38.04s)]
*  So we post the receipts. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=42.54s)]
*  So it's like, this action has been taken, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=44.94s)]
*  this action has been taken. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=46.78s)]
*  So when we get criticism, we say like, of what? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Which line do you disagree with? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Like, which cost saving do you disagree with? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=55.36s)]
*  And people usually can't think of any. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  So he's a lot calmer than these folks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  Take a look at this media montage, we call it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=63.4s)]
*  Listen, I think that there has been a tension [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=67.0s)]
*  between Elon Musk and a lot of Donald Trump's allies [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=68.84s)]
*  for a long time now, and there's been growing confusion. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=72.34s)]
*  We have said as reporters for weeks and weeks [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=75.34s)]
*  that there was gonna, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=78.08s)]
*  this relationship was going to come to a head. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=79.42s)]
*  You have two alphas, two billionaires [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=80.58s)]
*  who see themselves as the center of attention. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=82.74s)]
*  Why don't you go back to your day job and work that out [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=85.08s)]
*  and leave those of us who do government to do government, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=90.44s)]
*  because you can't do both. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=92.28s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=94.78s)]
*  Well, you know, he was saying that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  after one of the rockets went down this weekend, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=98.92s)]
*  am I right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=101.72s)]
*  Okay, so I am useless, you know? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=102.78s)]
*  And because I am, I can't fix anything. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  I can't help you with anything. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=109.4s)]
*  I could just use my mouth. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  So I never forget that, although man has been able [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=112.4s)]
*  to take all this raw material of earth [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  and create works of great power, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=117.66s)]
*  it's only an insignificant few who do that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=119.96s)]
*  We're just along for the ride. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=122.76s)]
*  You know, we think, oh, look what the great works [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=124.7s)]
*  that man has done. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=126.6s)]
*  Man is about a thousand people over, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=127.66s)]
*  I've contributed nothing to progress, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=130.3s)]
*  but at least I can recognize who does. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=133.18s)]
*  You know, I don't cheer against progress. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=135.58s)]
*  I support people who do. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=138.34s)]
*  I mean, imagine laughing at Jonas Salk [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=139.98s)]
*  as he was trying to come up with the polio vaccine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=141.74s)]
*  These people save lives. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=144.26s)]
*  I can't imagine these people being role models. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, what is their message? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=150.18s)]
*  If at first you don't succeed, just hang out with us. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=151.52s)]
*  You know, because they don't have to do anything. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=154.72s)]
*  I'm beginning to believe that progressives are regressive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=158.66s)]
*  And because they've been railing against technology, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  whether it's electric cars, whatever, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=164.66s)]
*  I think they got to lose the progress on progressives [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=167.52s)]
*  and just call them civs. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=170.16s)]
*  They're just civs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=171.88s)]
*  Everything goes through them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=173.4s)]
*  They hold nothing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=174.96s)]
*  They're incapable of creating anything of value. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=176.4s)]
*  From now on, they're civs. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=178.68s)]
*  And they're organized, Jesse. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=180.56s)]
*  To me, these look somewhat organized [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=182.92s)]
*  and there's usually always something behind that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=185.04s)]
*  Yeah, the billionaires that hate Musk [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=187.1s)]
*  are funding the Tesla terrorism. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=188.48s)]
*  And I'm wondering, where's the media? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=190.26s)]
*  This is not covered almost anywhere. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=192.24s)]
*  They're fire bombing Tesla stations. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=194.44s)]
*  Why hasn't the FBI infiltrated TranTifa too? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=197.32s)]
*  Cause it's these trans Antifa people that are responsible. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=200.0s)]
*  They seem to have been able to get underneath [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=203.18s)]
*  every single radical movement except TranTifa. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=204.96s)]
*  I think Cash Patel needs to get on that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=208.32s)]
*  And I'm mad at Greg. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=209.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=211.0s)]
*  Greg, you can't come out here [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=211.84s)]
*  and say our jobs are insignificant. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=212.66s)]
*  So what, this guy's an intergalactic pioneer. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=214.68s)]
*  We saved this country from Kamala Harris. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=217.34s)]
*  This show, you, me, you kind of helped Harold [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  in your own way, but let's not put ourselves down. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=224.24s)]
*  My Democrat sources, Dana, are telling me [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=227.28s)]
*  that they think attacking Musk is the wrong strategy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=229.32s)]
*  To go after him and oppose a person instead of a policy [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=233.02s)]
*  is really dumb because they tried that with Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=237.92s)]
*  Remember they attacked Trump's personality [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=240.7s)]
*  and then he won in a landslide [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=243.1s)]
*  because they could kind of put his personality aside [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=244.78s)]
*  because his policies were popular. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=247.88s)]
*  Same with Musk. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=249.9s)]
*  He might not have a great approval rating, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=250.74s)]
*  but cutting government is like 80% popular in this country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=252.46s)]
*  And their line of attack is silly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=256.98s)]
*  The judge brought it up earlier. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=259.42s)]
*  You can't call Trump a dictator [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=260.9s)]
*  and then also call Elon Musk the co-president. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=262.62s)]
*  You can't say he hires all loyalists [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=266.58s)]
*  and then there's like massive disagreements [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=268.88s)]
*  in a cabinet meeting. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=270.76s)]
*  So they haven't really figured out [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=272.12s)]
*  what they're gonna do yet, but this is not it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=273.68s)]
*  And the other problem, judge, you brought up last week [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=276.8s)]
*  is that if you have protests like this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=278.8s)]
*  and there's violence, let's say there's arrests, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=280.8s)]
*  you can't guarantee they're going to be prosecuted. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=283.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=284.96s)]
*  Especially in those two cities. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=285.8s)]
*  Yeah, because of the progressive DAs. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=286.62s)]
*  But you know what's interesting about all this? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=289.02s)]
*  Aside from the fact that you've got the left going after [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=290.84s)]
*  the guy who created electric cars [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=293.82s)]
*  and for whom he was a hero, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=295.64s)]
*  but do you remember when President Trump [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=299.52s)]
*  had that press conference with Elon Musk? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  It was very clear as the left tried to create this narrative [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=305.88s)]
*  that Elon Musk was a co-president, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  that Elon Musk comes out and says, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=312.2s)]
*  I do what the president tells me to do. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=314.96s)]
*  I'm here at the behest of the president. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=317.0s)]
*  And then all this stuff about Elon Musk [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=319.14s)]
*  and the president then comes out and he says, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=322.06s)]
*  I'm gonna take a scalpel to doge cuts. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm not gonna do it with the hatchet anymore. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=331.5s)]
*  So you know that clearly there is a president [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=334.98s)]
*  who is overseeing all of this, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=338.26s)]
*  where there's not really this craziness [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=340.18s)]
*  that the left is creating this antagonist [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=342.44s)]
*  that everybody is learning how to hate. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=346.98s)]
*  And they're throwing fits and you know, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=349.8s)]
*  they wanted us to be deprogrammed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=351.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, they gotta watch themselves. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the two alphas, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=354.76s)]
*  they're definitely fine together and America benefits. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=356.92s)]
*  How does the Democratic Party navigate this? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=360.56s)]
*  You're not useless. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=363.12s)]
*  Don't ever say that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=364.32s)]
*  The Democrats, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  the Democrats, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=367.68s)]
*  everyone has a right to disagree [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=369.6s)]
*  with whomever they wanna disagree with. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=371.12s)]
*  I don't espouse or promote or condone violence in any way, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  but if people wanna stop buying his car, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  they wanna protest peacefully, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=377.97999999999996s)]
*  every right to do that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=379.38s)]
*  Three, the president, you're right. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=380.9s)]
*  I'm glad you raised that, Judge. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=382.02s)]
*  It was President Trump as it relates to doge. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=383.02s)]
*  And I think that's where a lot of this motivation [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  and a lot of people are being instigated by [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=387.34s)]
*  is by some of the things that Mr. Musk is doing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=389.73999999999995s)]
*  as it relates to doge. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=391.97999999999996s)]
*  And President Trump said two things. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=393.38s)]
*  One, use a scalpel, not a hatchet. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=395.24s)]
*  I think he's absolutely right [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=397.32s)]
*  because there's some things in government. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=398.78s)]
*  I think we have this, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=400.14s)]
*  I think this weird unfortunate notion [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=401.29999999999995s)]
*  that when we think about government spending [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=403.85999999999996s)]
*  and we think about it being excessive, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=405.65999999999997s)]
*  people think about the worst things [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=408.02s)]
*  they think about in government, wherever you may sit. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  You make Democrats sometimes say, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=410.85999999999996s)]
*  it's too much defense spending. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=412.41999999999996s)]
*  Some people on the Republican side say, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=413.85999999999996s)]
*  it's too many public assistance programs, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=415.78s)]
*  welfare and so forth. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=417.76s)]
*  But when you really dig down into it, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  a lot of government spending is government investment [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=421.78s)]
*  that employs people, empowers innovation in places, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=424.26s)]
*  creates opportunity for communities across the country. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  What I think people want [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=430.53999999999996s)]
*  is to find those things that are redundant. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=431.62s)]
*  I think one of the things, and you said it, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=433.14s)]
*  I think you said it one time, Dana, last week or so, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=435.52s)]
*  people love for them to dig down and figure out [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=438.76s)]
*  where are the redundancies with these contracts? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=440.88s)]
*  Are we paying five people [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=442.64s)]
*  to do what one person should be doing [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=444.16s)]
*  or we only thought was doing? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=446.0s)]
*  That's where I think he can be most helpful. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=447.28s)]
*  And when Mr. Musk says, well, hey, no one is, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=449.92s)]
*  no one can cite a program, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=452.28s)]
*  I guarantee you, go to South Carolina, go to Alabama, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=453.72s)]
*  go to Texas, go to Oklahoma, go to Kansas, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=456.44s)]
*  where these congressmen and congresspeople [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=458.78s)]
*  are facing backlash because [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=460.68s)]
*  social security offices are being closed, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=462.44s)]
*  veterans' hospitals are being impacted. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=464.94s)]
*  These are things I don't think you wanna cut, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=467.09999999999997s)]
*  but guess what? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=468.82s)]
*  Whatever you have done or whatever you're doing, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=469.7s)]
*  that's the impact that it's having. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=471.5s)]
*  Again, Democrats, I would be focused on these things. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=473.34s)]
*  Let's stop the singing [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=476.73999999999995s)]
*  and let's stop some of the other craziness [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=478.7s)]
*  and get out talking about ideas, facts, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=480.38s)]
*  and answers to those challenges. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=483.05999999999995s)]
*  All right, up next, Democrats are struggling [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=485.58s)]
*  for an answer on trans athletes [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=487.41999999999996s)]
*  after Gavin Newsom broke with his party. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYjx8EMc50M&t=489.02s)]
