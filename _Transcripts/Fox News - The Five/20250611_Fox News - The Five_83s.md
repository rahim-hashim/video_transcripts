# Jesse Watters sounds off on the Trump ‘dictator’ hoax #shorts #trump #ice #politics #california #us
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY)
*  They're really going to go with a dictator hoax? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=0.0s)]
*  That whole attack on democracy thing, that message lost. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=2.48s)]
*  It lost in a landslide. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=5.72s)]
*  Attacking democracy is not enforcing the law. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=8.0s)]
*  All they're doing here is enforcing the law. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=11.52s)]
*  And they can't even get their story straight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  All right, first there was no riot, then there was a riot. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=15.88s)]
*  Then it was peaceful, then it was mostly peaceful. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=18.52s)]
*  Then Trump provoked the violence. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=20.64s)]
*  Now, how does Trump provoke violence [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=23.84s)]
*  if he lives in Washington? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=25.8s)]
*  He wasn't out there doing anything. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=27.48s)]
*  So the National Guard provoked the riots? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=29.2s)]
*  Because I didn't see a single National Guardsman [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=32.24s)]
*  melt down a Waymo or loot a store. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=34.52s)]
*  Not one. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=37.72s)]
*  This is a 60-40 issue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=38.64s)]
*  And that's according to Insider Advantage, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=41.8s)]
*  who nailed the last election. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Gavin thinks it's good politics [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=45.16s)]
*  to let your own city burn down. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=47.0s)]
*  That's good politics. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=49.0s)]
*  Maybe the crazy base on the left thinks it's good [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  because they love to see the country burn, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  but it's not good. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=54.24s)]
*  These illegals, Jessica, think they're living in Mexico. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=55.28s)]
*  They're waving the Mexican flag. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=58.68s)]
*  They don't like America. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=60.52s)]
*  They love living in LA, because LA is great. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=61.84s)]
*  It's nicer than Mexico, and you get free housing, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=64.56s)]
*  free healthcare, free food. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=67.04s)]
*  They don't even lay a finger on you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=68.48s)]
*  That's the problem here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=70.28s)]
*  They think they own the country, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=72.04s)]
*  they don't respect the laws, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=74.08s)]
*  and they don't respect the law enforcement. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=75.44s)]
*  I think Trump should go harder. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnnAqKkYeY&t=77.52s)]
