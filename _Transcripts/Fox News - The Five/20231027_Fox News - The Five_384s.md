# 'The Five': New phase of war imminent as IDF expands operations in Gaza
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8)
*  But first to the breaking news out of Israel, the IDF striking Gaza in the biggest offensive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=0.0s)]
*  yet. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=5.64s)]
*  21 days this has been going on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Let's go straight to Trey Yankst who's on the ground in southern Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=8.68s)]
*  And Trey, you told us a short time ago, this is the most that you have seen, the biggest [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=11.84s)]
*  escalation in this war to date. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=17.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Over the past several hours we've been watching as the Israeli Air Force hammers the Gaza [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=22.36s)]
*  Strip with airstrikes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=27.0s)]
*  In the distance you'll hear some explosions. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=28.92s)]
*  When the sky lights up that is an indication they are striking targets in the northern [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=31.64s)]
*  part of Gaza. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=35.64s)]
*  Above me you might be able to hear the buzz of an Israeli drone trying to pick out the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=37.0s)]
*  next targets for the Israelis. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=40.72s)]
*  It's not just the air campaign though. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=42.68s)]
*  Also on the ground the Israelis are pushing forward their artillery units to hammer the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=44.6s)]
*  eastern side of Gaza as ground forces do enter in a limited but expanded, according to the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=50.08s)]
*  Israeli military, raid. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=56.52s)]
*  Now we should make the distinction here, this is not, according to the military, the full [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=58.48s)]
*  scale ground operation that is anticipated but it is a much larger raid than we have [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  seen the past several nights. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=67.44s)]
*  Along the border here we've heard tanks firing into the Gaza Strip, we've heard machine gun [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=69.52s)]
*  fire and sources inside Gaza telling us they can hear those explosions there even as far [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=74.08s)]
*  down as the southern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  Remember Gaza's 25 miles long. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=82.4s)]
*  To give you a sense though just throughout the day what this has looked like, rocket [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  fire still coming off of Gaza 21 days into this conflict targeting not just southern [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=87.94s)]
*  but also central Israel sending hundreds of thousands of people to bomb shelters. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=92.86s)]
*  Guys back to you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=97.86s)]
*  Trey can you just give us some idea what you have seen and heard so far and if this was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=100.06s)]
*  indeed the full scale ground invasion that has been anticipated how we would know that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=107.06s)]
*  indeed is happening? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=113.18s)]
*  That's a great question and we spoke today in person in Tel Aviv, Israel's second largest [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=117.26s)]
*  city with Yoav Galin, the country's defense minister and I asked him a number of questions [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=121.78s)]
*  about the expected ground operation especially about the timing and he told me that once [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=127.06s)]
*  it begins this is not a question of weeks but rather months. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=132.66s)]
*  You can hear that explosion there, some outgoing artillery fire into the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=136.78s)]
*  This is a very active front line, I can hear the fighter jets overhead. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=142.16s)]
*  To give you a sense of what we've been hearing and seeing, like I said you'll see a large [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=146.02s)]
*  explosion and then the sky lights up, a loud boom in the distance but it's not just here [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=150.1s)]
*  that is facing this front, it's all over Israel because despite the Israeli airstrikes that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=156.34s)]
*  have continued since the October 7th massacre of so many innocent people here that kicked [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  off this ground war in the Middle East, there has been continued rocket fire toward major [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=167.38s)]
*  population centers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=173.32s)]
*  Just today a few hours ago we were taking fire here, air raid sirens were sounding, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=175.22s)]
*  you only have about 10 seconds to respond at this location so we had to rush to a nearby [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=179.94s)]
*  shelter and in Tel Aviv they have a little bit more time but they are facing similar [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=184.14s)]
*  scenarios and we really should note that while we talk about the bombs and the bullets and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=188.66s)]
*  the airstrikes, the civilian population here is paying such a heavy price, the psychological [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=193.86s)]
*  trauma of living amid this war three weeks in following a brutal massacre against the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=199.02s)]
*  civilian population is so difficult for the Israeli people and for the Jewish state to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  consume and inside Gaza more than 2 million Palestinians there, we are talking with them [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  tonight, a few of them do have the ability to text despite the fact that communication [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=216.62s)]
*  is down along the strip, anyone that has a foreign SIM card is able to get signal off [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=220.86s)]
*  of an Israeli cell tower and I have been trying to get more color of what is taking place [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=225.9s)]
*  inside Gaza but as we speak and you can hear the jets overhead, a ground war is unfolding [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  before our eyes and Israel's defense minister telling Fox News today this will last for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=235.58s)]
*  months. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  Guys? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  Trey, it is Janine Pirro here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  Now we have heard most of the day that this is a limited raid and that the heavy artillery [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=244.9s)]
*  but there is a report from Axios that says, Axios, it says Israel's war cabinet decided [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=251.46s)]
*  to expand ground operations in Gaza after talks on a possible hostage release with Hamas [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=258.22s)]
*  reached a stalemate, two Israeli officials told Axios and so now it appears and I am [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=264.92s)]
*  curious whether or not you have any information on this, that this may be the bigger raid [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=273.92s)]
*  based upon the failure of hostage negotiations. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=280.02000000000004s)]
*  So I have been working throughout the night talking with Western intelligence sources [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  and also regional sources who are familiar with the hostage situation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=288.5s)]
*  Today the Israelis actually raised the number of hostages being held inside Gaza to 229 [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=294.06s)]
*  people and as they get more information and proof of life for those Israelis that were [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  dragged into Gaza on October 7th, they will update the number. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=305.42s)]
*  In terms of the timing of tonight's expanded raid, it is challenging to say exactly why [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=310.18s)]
*  because this all has to do with the situation on the ground and I want to just read you [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  a few notes that I took today. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=320.94s)]
*  Much of the conversation was off the record with Israel's defense minister but we were [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=322.98s)]
*  able to get some information on the record cleared to report to you now and I want to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  take you through the mission of the Israeli army. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=331.46s)]
*  They give us four points of what they are trying to do. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=333.5s)]
*  They say the first one, the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capability [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=336.34s)]
*  along the strip. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=340.7s)]
*  The second one, returning those hostages that are being held. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=341.9s)]
*  We do understand there are high level negotiations going on behind the scenes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=344.78s)]
*  Remember already four have been released to American citizens and to Israeli citizens. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=348.3s)]
*  The third on the list here, securing Israel's southern arena where we're at right now and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=352.62s)]
*  then finally deterring Israel's adversaries in the region. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=356.7s)]
*  And you have to remember Iranian proxies exist across the Middle East, not just in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=359.3s)]
*  the Gaza Strip with Hamas and Islamic Jihad but also in Lebanon with the Lebanese militant [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=363.7s)]
*  group Hezbollah that's fired anti-tank missiles into northern Israel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpk9-c6c4t8&t=368.34000000000003s)]
