# 'The Five' on Elon's goodbye and who will be Dems' next 'Boogeyman'
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o)
*  Oh, Jesse, they can't quit Elon. They're going to miss him if they don't have him as a punching bag. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=0.0s)]
*  They should beg for him to stay because he's saving us a lot of money. Democrats don't care [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=5.28s)]
*  about that. When they did save us money, when Bill Clinton knocked off about 400,000 workers, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=10.08s)]
*  we all said, that a boy bill way to go. If Joe Biden had cut expenses, we would have said that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=15.52s)]
*  a boy Joey, because we're not going to fight just to fight like they do. We fight for what's right. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=22.0s)]
*  Now they're accusing him of being a drug addict. There was drug addicts in the last White House, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=28.8s)]
*  and there was cocaine all over the place. They didn't say anything about that when an actual [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=35.92s)]
*  drug act was running the country behind the scenes. I haven't seen any evidence of drugs, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=39.92s)]
*  but I am suspicious of the black guy. More on that later. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=45.84s)]
*  You're always suspicious about black guys. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=48.96s)]
*  Black guys. Yes, Greg. The Democrats, when you ask them what their plan is to reduce spending [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  and save us from debt crisis, they don't have a plan. Jessica the other day said, well, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=57.76s)]
*  we have to raise taxes. Okay. Well, that's funny because you can't raise taxes out of a $36 trillion [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=63.36s)]
*  hole. Barack Obama raised taxes and the debt went up. Joe Biden could have raised taxes, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=70.08s)]
*  but he didn't. Why not? So can't we just join together? And I say this to Jessica, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=77.6s)]
*  I say this to all the Democrats. Why can't we be good partners? We're all Americans. Let's work [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=83.28s)]
*  together. Let's not just kick the can down the road like you guys do and then explode when anybody [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=90.4s)]
*  tries to fix the problem you created. We are going to die as a country. I don't want to die together. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=95.84s)]
*  I want to live together in harmony with the Democratic Party and we can just save this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=102.0s)]
*  country from financial ruin. We can do this. I know we can. Jesse, maybe you could buy a Coke [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=107.36s)]
*  for Jessica. For those of us who are old enough to remember the commercial. It was a Pepsi. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=114.16s)]
*  I feel like you're about to burst into I'd like to buy the world a drink. It was a Pepsi. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=121.44s)]
*  Can you work together? Oh, that's specific. I can't, but you're trying to Coke, Jenna. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=127.92s)]
*  Forget it. Can you work together with Jesse? 100% but Jesse's got to give up his tax cut. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=132.08s)]
*  And he won't. No, you're not going to work with Jesse. No, he's rich and he needs that cut. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  Not a tax cut. You're getting an enormous tax cut. We're just keeping the tax rates the same. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=142.24s)]
*  Literally untrue. That's exactly what they're doing. No, it's not. It's just not true. It's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  not true. But if they don't pass this legislation, the tax cuts will go away. So there'll be a tax [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  rate. Exactly. Oh, okay. That's not how it works. That's the thing. Whoever sits in that seat, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=157.2s)]
*  if you like half agree with him, then he says that he's right. Give up your tax cut and we'll talk [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=164.16s)]
*  about some cost savings. We'll go with, I mean, Pete Hegseth promised us an audit of the Pentagon. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  It's never passed. It's never passed and they're getting a bigger budget. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about cuts to national defense. What do you think? I love the cut. Anyway. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  Is there waste within the Pentagon? What? Is there waste within the Pentagon? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=183.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure there's waste everywhere. But at the moment where you are supposed to be talking [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=186.8s)]
*  about waste, you don't need this massive transfer of wealth to the wealthy. And the 2017 Trump [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  tax cuts actually did have more for the lower classes than this package does. People earning [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  over $50,000, their incomes are going to go down. People earning over, what is it, four million for [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=202.0s)]
*  sure. And I think even over two and a half million are going to get a lot more money because of the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=208.24s)]
*  tax cuts. Jessica, it's just keeping the rates the same. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=214.32s)]
*  If that was a Democratic doge master that showed up with a shiner and there was a report that he [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  did so much ketamine that he couldn't pee straight, you would be leading your show with it. 100%. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  Can I bring in Greg here? Cause he's filthy rich. So I want to know what he thinks. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=230.88s)]
*  Yeah. What do you think of your tax cut? Filthy rich. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  Filthy and rich. Well, no, again, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=237.92s)]
*  uh, Jessica proves Jesse's point that they say that they are for the idea, but not the process. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=240.88s)]
*  It is always that off ramp to actually doing something that they will find, whether it is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=249.52s)]
*  crime, immigration, or the economy. Yo, I definitely want to get rid of waste, fraud, and abuse, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=255.36s)]
*  except wait, but, oh, I want safer streets, but what about no cash bail? We want an immigration [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=261.6s)]
*  process just like you, except we don't like the way you're doing it. And then, you know, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=269.76s)]
*  we realize they don't have a replacement. The idea of talking about these tax cuts is not even close [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=275.12s)]
*  to being a solution. The solution is cutting spending or spending ourselves off a cliff. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=281.92s)]
*  And you're saying we need to raise taxes. Why? Because you know, you can't cut spending. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  You want to raise taxes because you know, you will never ever cut spending. We just want to go back [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=292.32s)]
*  to five years ago. That's all we want. Can't we just have a budget from five years ago? That's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=297.44s)]
*  not too bad pre-COVID. Why can't we do that? You guys. All right. I want to go back to the front [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=302.96s)]
*  part of this segment where these Democrats were pushing the bad things that happened because of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=308.96s)]
*  Doge, that there were crimes committed. Okay. Let's compare their predictions to the other side's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=313.92s)]
*  predictions. We sat here and predicted the border crisis. They didn't. They mocked us. We predicted [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=320.72s)]
*  the trans issue. We knew this was going to be a big deal. They didn't. They called us transphobic. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=326.56s)]
*  We knew that there was going to be a Ferguson effect after George Floyd. They said, no, crime was [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=331.6s)]
*  getting better. They were wrong. Joe Biden's unwellness, Kamala's incompetence. We were the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=336.96s)]
*  ones that when we made predictions because of our filter were correct. Compare that to the other [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=344.0s)]
*  side. Nothing that they predict, which is always existential, apocryphal, delusional, never happens. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=349.84s)]
*  Right? What did they say? Threat to democracy. The planet's going to end. The laptop is fake. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=357.11999999999995s)]
*  Russians are behind this. None of that panned out. And now what they're saying about Doge, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=363.52s)]
*  they're saying, oh my God, people are going to starve. So they were actually taking the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  debt. No, it's oh my God. Let me finish for once. This country is overweight. You have [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=375.84s)]
*  lost the right for people to believe your hypothetical fantasies because they're never [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=383.84s)]
*  right. And you're willing to take the debt crisis and crush it under another fantasy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=389.84s)]
*  We don't believe you. And guess what? We don't have reason to believe you. And like you brought [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=395.28s)]
*  up, you brought up the the the Elon Musk drug thing. Why should we believe that when it comes [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=401.76s)]
*  out now? Do you think using your what if this happened or what if this what if he came out in [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=407.76s)]
*  support of Biden? We never would have heard about the ketamine, but he's pro Trump. And now you're [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  talking about the ketamine. He's having an impact as a public servant on America. Now you bring up [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=418.0s)]
*  the ketamine. You know, it's funny. This guy is doing nothing but service. He's getting nothing [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=423.84s)]
*  out of this. That used to be a Democrat. That used to be a public servant. And now a guy who [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=429.2s)]
*  creates Neuralink creates an Internet process for the poor electric cars, robots, rockets that save [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=435.2s)]
*  astronauts. He's a public servant who's also the richest man. And you guys don't like him. He's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=443.92s)]
*  exactly what a Democrat used to be a public servant. But now you only serve yourselves. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=450.88s)]
*  You're like, what can I get out of this? And if we use identity politics, we can get everybody [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=457.68s)]
*  to declare what they want from somebody else. It becomes an attack over a finite pie when he [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=462.72s)]
*  just wants to expand it there. I've said enough. I think I could go home early. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=467.52s)]
*  Katie, would you like to wrap it up? I would love to. So going off of Greg's point, Democrats entire [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=474.16s)]
*  survival and existence depends on a bloated government, whether it's taxpayer dollars going [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=480.48s)]
*  to NGOs for their pet projects, taxpayer money going to these big universities where they can [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=485.44s)]
*  indoctrinate all these kids to then go out into the world and spew liberal ideology and to talk [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=490.48s)]
*  about how we need even more government spending. The list goes on and on. The handouts that they [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=496.56s)]
*  want through the government. The federal government has no business engaging in. Democrats are [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=501.28s)]
*  perfectly happy with having rampant corruption, government waste that's going to tank the country [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=505.76s)]
*  into oblivion because of all the debt that we have so long as it preserves their political power [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=510.96s)]
*  and they're able to continue the Washington grift that continues on and on. Trump brought [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  he on in, which is another example of how he does things very differently. Someone from the private [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=520.48s)]
*  sector to say people have been saying for 30, 40 years that this needs to be done. You hear it today. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=524.8s)]
*  I think that we should cut spending, but I just don't think it should be done this way. Well, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  which way should we have another commission to write a report among a report, another report to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=533.92s)]
*  say that we need to cut this kind of spending, not to mention going in and finding it where we [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=539.44s)]
*  didn't even know it existed. And now it's Congress's job to do what they were elected to do, to go in [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=542.8800000000001s)]
*  and to stop the abuse of the American taxpayer, to codify these cuts, which 60, 70% of Americans [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=549.36s)]
*  actually agree with and move on because the country cannot survive in Elon's words while we're [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=556.0s)]
*  ruled by our bureaucracy and not governed by democracy or in our Republic. That's just the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  bottom line. So that's why they're so upset because they're coming after the way that they [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=568.24s)]
*  survive and Democrats can't survive without a big government. Well, both sides have argued for [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2RibL9s0o&t=572.0s)]
