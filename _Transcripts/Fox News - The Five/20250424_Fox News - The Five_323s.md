# 'The View' trashes Trump's baby bonus as racist
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E)
*  President Trump is considering a $5,000 baby bonus check [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=0.0s)]
*  to help the cost of raising a little one [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=4.0s)]
*  and to combat declining birth rates. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  But leave it to The View to call it, wait for it, racist. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=8.64s)]
*  In 2024, there was a 1% increase in U.S. births. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=12.34s)]
*  But that increase was with Hispanic mothers [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=16.78s)]
*  and Asian mothers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=21.28s)]
*  Ah-ha-ha-ha. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=22.48s)]
*  So they don't seem to be concerned about that increase. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=24.28s)]
*  They seem to be more concerned about a decrease [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=29.72s)]
*  in other populations. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=32.82s)]
*  Say it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  No, I think I've said enough. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  You have to read between the lines. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  I just gave the stats. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=39.16s)]
*  I mean, Greg, talk about a lazy argument. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=41.16s)]
*  It's racist. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=42.92s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=43.86s)]
*  The View needs to do a segment on things [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=44.86s)]
*  they don't believe is racist. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=47.86s)]
*  Look, it would last maybe 10 seconds. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=49.96s)]
*  And then Sonny would say, that segment is racist. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=53.64s)]
*  Because in The View's world, everything is racist [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=58.26s)]
*  because they don't have to do any research. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=60.5s)]
*  They don't have to think. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=62.5s)]
*  They just sit down and they go, what is in my filter? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=63.3s)]
*  How can I make this racist? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=66.44s)]
*  Here's a fun little experiment. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=68.2s)]
*  So paying people to have kids is racist. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=69.58s)]
*  What if you flipped it? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=72.14s)]
*  What if it was, we will pay you to have an abortion? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=73.52s)]
*  Get an abortion and we will pay you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  Will they call that racist? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=79.52s)]
*  You know they will. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=80.86s)]
*  They should. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=82.22s)]
*  But see? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=83.82s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=86.02s)]
*  Thank you, Kaylee. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=87.42s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=88.38000000000001s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=89.22s)]
*  Dana, Whoopi was saying that $5,000, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=90.22s)]
*  she was making fun of it, essentially saying [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=92.72s)]
*  it was small potatoes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  But to a lot of people, $5,000 is something they could use. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=95.26s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Look, I think that the White House is throwing up [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  a bunch of trial balloons just to see, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=101.9s)]
*  like, what do you think about this? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=103.4s)]
*  And there's ideas everywhere that this idea [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  has been tried in the world that hasn't worked out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=107.04s)]
*  It's not the answer. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=108.98s)]
*  I believe that we need to figure out a way [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=110.34s)]
*  to encourage people to have more children. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=112.0s)]
*  One of the concerns that a lot of families have is the cost. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=113.48s)]
*  And $5,000 isn't going to cut it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=116.72s)]
*  One of the big problems is daycare. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=118.6s)]
*  And it's something that we've talked about, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  the cost of daycare. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=122.2s)]
*  And one of the things that happened is universal pre-K, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=123.16s)]
*  part of an Obamacare thing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=125.44s)]
*  You might say, that sounds like a nice thing to do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=126.64s)]
*  What are the consequences of it? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=128.6s)]
*  Well, other daycare stuff closed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=129.98s)]
*  Now, these daycares are too expensive for people to go to. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=131.84s)]
*  This just happened in New Jersey for a friend of mine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=134.68s)]
*  They have two kids in the daycare. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=138.18s)]
*  The universal pre-K comes in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=140.12s)]
*  It's available for everyone, but they have a private one. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=142.76s)]
*  The insurance is up. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  The regulations are up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=146.82s)]
*  The interest rates are up. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=148.16s)]
*  The costs are up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=149.52s)]
*  Everything's up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  She can't make ends meet anymore. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=151.06s)]
*  She has to close. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=152.36s)]
*  So my friend calls the universal pre-K place. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=153.16s)]
*  Can I get my two kids? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=156.12s)]
*  Oh, sorry, we're full. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=157.08s)]
*  So now what is she supposed to do? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=158.6s)]
*  So they would like to have more children. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=160.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  And then you have to start thinking, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  does that make any sense? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=164.96s)]
*  So I think that, again, I would just go back to this White House [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=165.96s)]
*  has a good idea and a good plan to do permanent tax relief, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  get that underway, get the regulations down, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=172.68s)]
*  and figure out a way to have more competition, less [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  regulations, in order to get the economy going in a way [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  that people feel more confident to have children. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=180.6s)]
*  Brian, it's a huge problem. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=182.6s)]
*  Immigration, according to NBC, accounted for all US population [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  growth, all in 2020. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=187.68s)]
*  Unbelievable, and especially the ones that got aways [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=189.56s)]
*  don't count either. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=191.88s)]
*  I know this is, and Victor Orban with Hungry says, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=193.4s)]
*  I'm going to give loans up to $500,000 to young married [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=196.4s)]
*  couples who have kids. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  And if you have another kid, it's another incentive. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=201.4s)]
*  I think that sooner or later, the kid's going to find out, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=203.84s)]
*  I only had you for the money. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=206.08s)]
*  And they're going to grow up and going to need a therapist [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  who's going to get it back. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=209.72s)]
*  Craig, how mad are you? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=210.68s)]
*  You acted too quick. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=211.56s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  By the way, you said got aways. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  Are those the babies that get born? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=216.28s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=218.16s)]
*  I wasn't thinking return any wise. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=219.52s)]
*  I was thinking more. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=221.12s)]
*  Jessica, you had Ivanka Trump who [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=222.32s)]
*  talked about paid family leave. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=224.88s)]
*  You have the Trump administration double the child tax credit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=226.28s)]
*  Now this, I think this is something [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=228.56s)]
*  left to get on board with. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=229.8s)]
*  So the child tax credit, which came [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=232.36s)]
*  in under the Democratic Party. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  Double the Trump. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=239.52s)]
*  Anyway, it cut childhood poverty by 50%. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=240.68s)]
*  And we're actually looking to increase it even more, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=242.8s)]
*  up to $4,000. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=244.56s)]
*  And they should pass that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  But Dana's completely right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=246.68s)]
*  We've seen a 263% spike in the cost of daycare and pre-K [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFcDhL4R8E&t=247.96s)]
