# Tyrus calls out 'laughable' socialist Bernie Sanders on 'B.S.' #shorts #politics #foxnews #news
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o)
*  I think it's amazing that a socialist has a speaking fee, by the way. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=0.0s)]
*  I wonder how much of that money went to the good people of Sanders, probably to help build [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=3.44s)]
*  his mansion. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=7.88s)]
*  This is laughable. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  When you are speaking about a wrong, you shouldn't have to look down at a piece of paper. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=11.48s)]
*  If you are speaking about injustice, that's all you need to see, is that they are just [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=16.88s)]
*  saying things with no actual facts behind it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=27.24s)]
*  It's not a battle for Gen Z. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  It's common sense versus BS. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=33.12s)]
*  Bernie Sanders goes out there and tells a bunch of people who can afford to be there [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=37.36s)]
*  how bad their lives are. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=40.48s)]
*  But every one of them can afford $20 Lemonades, $30 cheeseburgers, and continue to cheer and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=42.8s)]
*  have ... That's a rough life. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  Those guys were hurting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=52.9s)]
*  And then you know what the worst part of that night was? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=54.14s)]
*  The long line of valet. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=56.18s)]
*  Unbelievable that they had to wait up to 20 to 45 minutes for their valet. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=57.98s)]
*  Times are tough for them right now in America. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjSCs1tN7o&t=63.3s)]
