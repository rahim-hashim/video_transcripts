**Fox News - The Five:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8)
*  Fox News alert a brand new photo showing the two American hostages who were released by the Hamas terrorists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=0.0s)]
*  Judith Renan and her 18 year old daughter Natalie who are from outside Chicago are now with Israeli forces and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=7.32s)]
*  undergoing medical care Mike Tobin is in southern Israel with more Mike [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Well, Natalie and Judith Renan judge from Evanston, Illinois are released from Hamas captivity. They're out of the Gaza Strip [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=21.36s)]
*  They are either at an Israeli base in southern Israel now or headed in that direction where they are scheduled to be reunited with family [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=29.08s)]
*  Some of the family members have already been on special report expressing their hopes to get their loved ones released [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=36.12s)]
*  The Hamas terrorists had brought them into one of the family's house [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  They stayed there. They get the Hamas gathered them with another family and they brought the both of them in there and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=49.32s)]
*  And [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=57.2s)]
*  The eyewitness told us that about 30 minutes later [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=58.44s)]
*  They handcuffed Judith and Natalie and both of the men that were there after murdering one [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=62.24s)]
*  Of her daughters that was lying dead in the other room. We're very anxious to be able to reunite them with their loved ones [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=68.92s)]
*  We welcome their release [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=75.56s)]
*  We share in the relief that their families friends and loved ones are feeling [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=77.2s)]
*  But there are still ten additional Americans who remain unaccounted for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=83.02s)]
*  In this conflict every single one of them should be released [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  Natalie and Judith were met at the crossing into Gaza or out of Gaza by Gal Hirsch [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  He is a retired Israeli general who was bought out of retirement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and given the task this very difficult task [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=99.14s)]
*  of securing the release of now [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=107.14s)]
*  198 hostages believed to be held by [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=109.78s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=113.14s)]
*  It should be noted that both the US and Hamas gave credit to the Qataris for striking the deal that secured their release [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=115.5s)]
*  Judge all right Mike stay safe. Thanks so much and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=122.86s)]
*  The release of two American hostages might complicate Israel's imminent ground invasion [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=127.18s)]
*  Republican candidate Nikki Haley warning it could be Hamas trying to buy time and delay [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=132.9s)]
*  A two prayers have been answered and we've got 200 more to go. That's the first thing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=139.54s)]
*  I'll say the second thing I'll say to the Biden administration is don't fall for it [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  What they're doing is they're gonna throw two hostages out there for one to see if they can weaken us to keep Israel from going [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=147.94s)]
*  into [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=154.66s)]
*  Gaza and two because they want to see if they can get something out of it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  Okay, Jesse, I'll start with you why these two the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=162.06s)]
*  There are over 200 as I understand it hostages why two Americans why not Israelis [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=167.1s)]
*  I mean they had a whole group to choose from I probably shouldn't say it [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=174.12s)]
*  But the American hostages in terms of the international landscape very valuable [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=178.46s)]
*  Especially when we're sponsoring the Israeli assault through these weapons transfers [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=183.78s)]
*  They're trying to drive a little bit of a wedge here. I understand the tactic [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=189.38s)]
*  Iran is involved the Qataris are kind of tangentially involved and Hamas is involved because this is the only leverage they have [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=194.44s)]
*  They've been doing this begging other Arabs to get involved in this assault. They're not [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=201.84s)]
*  Despite a few missiles from Yemen and this is their other way of saying hey guys [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=207.44s)]
*  You know what if you just halt this ground invasion will release the hostages. I'm not buying it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=212.68s)]
*  I'm not buying it. They could do a drip drip drip and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=218.48s)]
*  I don't think is real right now is is concerned with returning hostages as they are with decimating Hamas [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=222.32s)]
*  So they're gonna go in pretty soon and they're gonna go in with f-16s. You're gonna with bulldozers tanks [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  drones and the infantry is gonna go house to house door to door and it's gonna be ugly and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  Then they're going into the tunnels and they're gonna go in with tunnel rats with knives and maybe even flood them and the goal [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=241.44s)]
*  It looks like is to push half the population [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=247.44s)]
*  South into southern Gaza and create a northern I [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=250.96s)]
*  Wish maybe like a DMZ where there's no Hamas there. I guess they kind of have control over the situation [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  maybe you give it like a buffer designation and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=263.96s)]
*  I don't know if they're gonna have time to do that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=268.16s)]
*  They say that they're gonna do this for a year [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  They don't have a year because as this ground assault develops all of these Arabs who are angry already [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=272.96s)]
*  Are gonna be watching Al Jazeera and Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Lebanon and they're gonna see the devastation the destruction [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=279.6s)]
*  And it's gonna look really bad. So they're gonna mount mobs against embassies. They're gonna [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=287.16s)]
*  Scream into the air and it's gonna get tense. And so it's does the United States and does Israel [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=293.04s)]
*  Do they have the focus and the determination to let this ground assault play out no matter what the? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=300.0s)]
*  PR collateral damages [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  Adjustment advised that President Biden has spoken by phone with the family of the two Americans who've been released [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=309.36s)]
*  So that is a good thing, but but let me go to you Katie [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=316.64s)]
*  What kind of intelligence do you think we can gather from these two women who've been released? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=320.16s)]
*  Well, they certainly know maybe where they were held, but they also could have been blindfolded [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=326.48s)]
*  They they were blindfolded on the way into get the Gaza Strip clearly [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=331.92s)]
*  They don't know exactly where they were they may be of course they can talk about how they were treated which I can't imagine [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=335.5s)]
*  The things that they went through [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=340.85999999999996s)]
*  But they're gonna need some time to to really think about what has happened to them and they deserve some space [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=342.78s)]
*  The intelligence will take care of itself when it comes to what the Israelis know what the US knows in terms of their hostage negotiation [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=348.58s)]
*  We're grateful for their release [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=356.41999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, but it's a very low bar for Hamas and they should be given no goodwill and that goes for Qatar as well when it comes [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=358.5s)]
*  to this release there as the Secretary of State mentioned ten Americans who are still unaccounted for 30 Americans were killed as [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  a result of this incursion and Hamas is using hostages in the Gaza Strip as [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=372.58s)]
*  human shields to as a way to avoid accountability and to avoid [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=378.26s)]
*  Accountability for what they've done and what they did and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=384.9s)]
*  The Americans need to push the Israelis to do what they have to do to get this job done [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=388.74s)]
*  There is not a lot of time and space for this to happen [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=392.98s)]
*  And especially if we're gonna be sending an aid without any conditions of releasing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=396.82s)]
*  Hostages as well when there are photos of Hamas using aid from UNESCO during their assault in Israel [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  So I hope they can be helpful in terms of giving [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  Americans and Israel intelligence to free other hostages [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=412.70000000000005s)]
*  But given there's hundreds of miles of tunnels very difficult to use anything maybe that they came up with to find the others [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=415.92s)]
*  You know Jessica there are there are people who are giving Hamas credit saying, you know [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=423.14000000000004s)]
*  That's showing the humanitarian side [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=430.18s)]
*  But you don't try to obliterate a people and burn people alive and kill children to go to sleep in their own beds [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=432.86s)]
*  And then suddenly become humanitarian. Do you know I don't think so and I think it is important that people when they discuss this [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=439.3s)]
*  massacre [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=448.06s)]
*  Continue to reiterate the details of it that they pulled babies from their beds that they gouged their eyes out that they took [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=449.22s)]
*  Grandparents who had survived the Holocaust who needed urgent medical care didn't care raped women went to a peaceful music festival [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=455.5s)]
*  And did the most gruesome things you could ever imagine pure barbarism [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=464.14s)]
*  So what they did is they did something smart and strategic at this moment. Jesse's completely right [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=469.38s)]
*  They had to go with Americans first because we are the ones that are funding all of this [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=474.1s)]
*  We also know from past precedent that Israelis will trade a lot for hostages [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=478.14s)]
*  They have before traded up to a thousand people for one Israeli to come home now. I [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=483.74s)]
*  Think it's important. There are only 15 million of us on the planet right now of Jews 6 million of us were exterminated [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=490.18s)]
*  Every life counts, but you better believe the terrorists know that that's how Netanyahu thinks about it [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=496.58s)]
*  That's not how Joe Biden thinks about it necessarily [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=503.5s)]
*  It's a different kind of game that he's playing [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=505.7s)]
*  Thinking about what's gonna happen from the north. What happens? He said last night. We have to hold Iran accountable [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=508.62s)]
*  What does that look like? We don't know yet, but we know that we're watching them and seems to get involved [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=513.72s)]
*  I want to repeat something though from yesterday that general Pat Ryan the spokesman at the Pentagon said that's really important [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=518.22s)]
*  so you have to trust us that we know more than you do and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=524.78s)]
*  That's very clear that two hostages are out today [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=528.1s)]
*  Hopefully it will increase on a daily basis that we get more and more out and then we can continue to squeeze them and that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=530.8199999999999s)]
*  They are so afraid of what's coming that they let all 200 of these people out [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=536.66s)]
*  But people need to have more confidence in the American government and in the Israeli government that they know more than we do and they're [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  Working day and night to make sure that these two is just the start of the floodgates [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=549.02s)]
*  And they are the experts the American and the Israelis Greg and the truth is I mean that you know [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=553.02s)]
*  You keep delaying and what we saw I think it was yesterday [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=558.98s)]
*  We saw a prime in a prime minister Netanyahu talking to the forces [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=562.6600000000001s)]
*  It's what you generally see with any any kind of leader talking to the forces before they go into war and then all of a [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=566.34s)]
*  Sudden there was a lull today because of the negotiations [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=573.1800000000001s)]
*  When do they go in now? I don't know. I'm no expert on military [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=576.7800000000001s)]
*  But I do know the media pretty well and at the Blinken press or a reporter used the hostage release to say [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=581.46s)]
*  Isn't this a moment for a pause ie ceasefire which again? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  We can all pretty much agree as part of the Hamas plan. Look they hold the cards [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=593.26s)]
*  They have 200 hostages [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=598.0200000000001s)]
*  So they might be doing this to buy time just to get in the right place to inflict more damage [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=600.0600000000001s)]
*  And this is part of a PR crusade to stop a ground or put off a ground invasion [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  We're not really that bad after all we didn't really kill as many people as you think and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=609.4200000000001s)]
*  They're hoping that our media will treat it as such the media as we've seen this week are really good at being used [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=614.42s)]
*  And this is the problem the challenge of the micro coverage of this war Hamas exploits [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=621.0999999999999s)]
*  is they know that we react to every single thing they do and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=626.4599999999999s)]
*  You have to be aware that they have an ulterior motive because they know that which is why it's important [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=630.38s)]
*  It's important for us and as Americans and these viewers to step back and ignore those who say maybe the threat is exaggerated [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=636.06s)]
*  They just released host hostages, you know, this is their strategy. This is their tragedy. It's good to be hopeful [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=643.1s)]
*  We're glad they're released but do not be naive this moment by moment coverage [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=649.74s)]
*  Requires an ongoing commentary that is at the mercy of confusion [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=654.7s)]
*  Nobody knows anything and you're right. It's what we don't know that matters, right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=659.78s)]
*  So I say pull back assess with patience the speculation about first second or third fronts and impending ground [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=664.3000000000001s)]
*  Invasions and delaying tactics and who's gonna do what? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=670.74s)]
*  Stop Israel has decided their course the release of these hostages is good [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=673.9000000000001s)]
*  But then anticipate something bad because that's war. This is this you may think it's a humanitarian gesture. I don't think so [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHp4sOZVph8&t=679.12s)]
