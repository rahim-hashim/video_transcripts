# Watters says Dems have been ‘losing’ every day since DOGE
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU)
*  So check it out here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=0.0s)]
*  You're looking live at the White House, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=1.5s)]
*  where in just moments from now, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=3.04s)]
*  President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Modi [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=4.38s)]
*  are set to hold a news conference. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=7.04s)]
*  And while we wait for that, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=8.88s)]
*  let's talk about the Democrats who pride Musk. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=10.98s)]
*  Former Congressman Dean Phillips trying to warn his party [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=13.76s)]
*  that the collective freakout over the world's richest man [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=16.26s)]
*  and self-proclaimed Doge father [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  could destroy their credibility in the long run. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=21.72s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, Democrats are only focused [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=26.14s)]
*  on one thing right now, Mr. Musk. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=27.96s)]
*  The fact of the matter, he's quite popular. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=29.98s)]
*  We're missing the boat as Democrats. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=31.78s)]
*  And all I'm saying is that sometimes it's better [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=33.22s)]
*  to join them and actually play a role [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=36.08s)]
*  in how the strategy works, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  rather than so pathetically, frankly, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=40.38s)]
*  try to combat something that clearly is a steamroller [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=43.1s)]
*  and Democrats are being steamrolled. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=45.96s)]
*  I think Democrats should join the club [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=47.36s)]
*  and then have more credibility to actually raise the alarm [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  about constitutional issues. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=53.5s)]
*  Right now, it's the boy who cried wolf. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=54.7s)]
*  But Dean Phillips might as well be shouting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=56.8s)]
*  into the void of that limestone mountain of paperwork. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=58.78s)]
*  Democrats name dropping Musk at two different events. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  First in a house hearing on USAID, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=64.62s)]
*  that's an agency that Doge gutted, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=67.02s)]
*  and another rally outside [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=69.42s)]
*  the Department of Veterans Affairs. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=70.86s)]
*  Watch here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=72.22s)]
*  You can't spell felon without Elon. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=73.92s)]
*  Trump and Musk like to say, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=76.12s)]
*  we're reading out fraud, waste and abuse. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=77.7s)]
*  We're looking at efficiency. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=80.86s)]
*  That's a dog whistle. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk ripped up the constitution [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=84.6s)]
*  and our system of checks and balances. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=87.1s)]
*  The Trump administration and unelected billionaire Elon Musk [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=88.84s)]
*  have led a reckless and illegal attack on USAID. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=92.24s)]
*  Nine million veterans are watching you [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=96.08s)]
*  give them the middle finger. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=99.08s)]
*  And we're not going to stand for it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=102.02s)]
*  President Trump revealing Doge's next target [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=104.52s)]
*  while providing the group some cover. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  I think that the Internal Revenue Service [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=109.96s)]
*  will be looked at like everybody else. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  Just about everybody's going to be looked at. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=114.84s)]
*  So it's, they're doing a hell of a job. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  It's an amazing job they're doing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=120.28s)]
*  I call it the force of super geniuses, but it's building. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  And you know, they go up and they talk to some of the people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=125.12s)]
*  about certain deals and the people get all tongue tied. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=127.68s)]
*  They can't talk. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=130.12s)]
*  Judge, it's hard to understand why the Democrats [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=132.28s)]
*  are so mad at Elon Musk. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=134.08s)]
*  He voted for Obama. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  He created the best electric car, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=137.86s)]
*  which they purport to love. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=139.9s)]
*  He can't run for president. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=141.16s)]
*  He's doing things for free. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=142.86s)]
*  And they just think that he is enemy number one. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think it just goes to show you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=147.96s)]
*  that it's all about politics for them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=149.86s)]
*  And the sad part about that statement [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  is that it ignores the American people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=154.24s)]
*  I mean, we finally have someone who is willing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=156.84s)]
*  to take a look at all of the fraud, the waste and abuse [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=160.18s)]
*  in our government and in the bureaucracy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=165.22000000000003s)]
*  And as opposed to applauding that and saying, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=168.26000000000002s)]
*  great, this is going to benefit the American people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  and pay through taxes through the nose. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=173.18s)]
*  Instead, they say they're only focused [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=175.92s)]
*  on how horrible Elon Musk is or how horrible Donald Trump is. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=177.96s)]
*  And I think it's very frustrating [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=181.92s)]
*  because to me, it's disappointing, Harold, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  that the Democrats are not appreciative [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=187.26s)]
*  of this kind of thing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=189.3s)]
*  Because in the end, but you still have Fetterman, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=190.3s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, James Carville, Dean Phillips. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=192.78s)]
*  I mean, these guys, even Hakeem Jeffries is saying, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=195.78s)]
*  we've got to find common ground with them on something. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=198.14s)]
*  But they ignored the history of the Clinton presidency [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=201.0s)]
*  when I fired 400,000 people, bureaucrats. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=205.44s)]
*  And they called it the National Partnership [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=208.98s)]
*  Reinventing Government [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=211.32s)]
*  to make the federal government less expensive. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=212.88s)]
*  And it was Obama who pledged to do the same in 2011. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=214.92s)]
*  So all this does is it comes down to hate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=218.38s)]
*  It's like, when you get divorced, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=221.62s)]
*  you hate the other person so much, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  you don't care if it hurts the kids. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=226.5s)]
*  And then we're actually going to talk about [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  Department of Education a little bit too, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=232.02s)]
*  because those are supposedly about kids. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  I found out today that Bernie Sanders was the chairman [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=235.62s)]
*  of the Education Committee for four years. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=237.96s)]
*  Under Biden had one hearing on education the entire time. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  And then they go and complain. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  Hey, Harold, what do you think about these protests [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=245.46s)]
*  that are a throwback? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  Are they having any effect? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=251.44000000000003s)]
*  I don't, first of all, good to be with you again. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=255.34s)]
*  I think that Dean Phillips is largely right. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=256.85999999999996s)]
*  I think the judge is as well. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=260.26s)]
*  I tried to say yesterday, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=262.94s)]
*  and perhaps I didn't say it as clearly as I wanted to, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=264.73999999999995s)]
*  there's a time for outrage, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=268.2s)]
*  and then there's a time to assess impact. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=270.94s)]
*  The outrage for Democrats should have ended [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=273.73999999999995s)]
*  when the election ended. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  There were so many awful things said about President Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=277.46s)]
*  He said some awful things about Democrats, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=281.11999999999995s)]
*  but I think Democrats said more awful things about him. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=282.76s)]
*  And the instinct to want to try to work with him, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=285.97999999999996s)]
*  I think, is the right instinct. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=288.32s)]
*  So the outrage is there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=290.02s)]
*  You now got to look at the impact. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  The country, no one has ever won office saying, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=293.32s)]
*  elect me, I will grow government. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  I will grow the debt, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  and I will make it unrecognizably large. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=299.7s)]
*  Anyone that tries to do that has lost. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  Democrat presidents, you mentioned it, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=304.26s)]
*  and I like your Valentine's Day red, judge. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=306.64s)]
*  You mentioned how these Democrats [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=310.29999999999995s)]
*  that Obama wanted to cut, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=312.84s)]
*  Clinton wanted to cut, they're reinventing government, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=314.28s)]
*  and no one ever did. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=316.55999999999995s)]
*  The thing I would urge Democrats to do [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  as opposed to standing outside and singing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  and being so critical, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=322.52s)]
*  if you're gonna be critical, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=324.23999999999995s)]
*  you have to answer what Elon Musk, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  who is a popular guy in Donald Trump [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=327.44s)]
*  who just won the election and has a 53% approval rating, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=329.44s)]
*  counter their cuts with other cuts. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=333.28s)]
*  Senator Cassidy, Senators Cassidy and Britt today [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=335.44s)]
*  in the last 24 hours have said, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=338.0s)]
*  look, Senator Cassidy said, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=339.4s)]
*  cutting medical funding is not gonna help LSU. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=341.08s)]
*  We're from a red state, and we don't, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=343.92s)]
*  our tax dollars, we give back more tax dollars. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  Senator Britt said, you can't cut medical funding as well. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=348.16s)]
*  These are the kinds of things you should be focused on [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=351.24s)]
*  as opposed to the yelling [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=353.56s)]
*  and the kind of scattered outrage [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=355.12s)]
*  that seems to afflict the party. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=357.36s)]
*  I'm a believer that the reason [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=359.68s)]
*  that Elon Musk is able to do this, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=361.76s)]
*  I say to Democrats in Congress and Republicans, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  the reason he's able to use up your responsibilities [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=365.68s)]
*  is because you have an exercise oversight responsibility [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  in so long, and you haven't been a budgeting body [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=370.88s)]
*  in so long, you go through shutdowns and defaults. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=373.52s)]
*  That's the only language that comes from Congress. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  If you wanna take back this responsibility, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  hold the hearings, identify cuts that you would impose [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  as opposed to the ones the president's talking about. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  And with that, Your Honor, that's my opening argument. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=388.76s)]
*  All right, we will continue on then. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=390.52s)]
*  The federal government, Jesse. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=393.12s)]
*  I rest my face. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=393.96s)]
*  Ha, federal government less popular than ever. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=395.0s)]
*  So the question kind of is, if not now, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=398.64s)]
*  when would you try to cut it? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=400.64s)]
*  It's gotta be now, Dana. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=402.68s)]
*  Can I tell you a story about Robin Dunmarcos? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=403.76s)]
*  I would love to. Please. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=406.8s)]
*  Robin Dunmarcos worked for these two nonprofits, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=407.68s)]
*  International Rescue Committee and the Church World Service. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=410.44s)]
*  She leapfrogs over to the Biden administration [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=414.48s)]
*  to work for HHS, the refugee office, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=417.04s)]
*  the one that lost all the little kids. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=419.68s)]
*  And then she steers a billion dollars, a billion dollars [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=421.6s)]
*  to the two nonprofits that she used to work for. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=426.36s)]
*  That's how this whole game works. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=429.32s)]
*  We're finding out HHS under Joe Biden [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  spent $22 billion on migrants. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=434.32s)]
*  $22 billion. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=437.76s)]
*  And it's not just these little tent cities. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=439.56s)]
*  They were buying them cars. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=441.76s)]
*  They were helping them own homes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=444.16s)]
*  They were paying off their credit cards. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  How'd they get a credit card? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=448.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=449.68s)]
*  They were buying college tuition. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=450.68s)]
*  They were giving them startup money [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  to start businesses, Harold. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=454.76s)]
*  Why are you talking about me? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=456.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=457.72s)]
*  Harold's being good today. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=458.64s)]
*  So far. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=460.4s)]
*  These are the kind of things we're spending money on. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=461.96s)]
*  We are staging hamster fight clubs, Dana. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=464.44s)]
*  We're putting dead turtles on treadmills. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=468.0s)]
*  Now, I know what happens when you put anything dead [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=470.52s)]
*  in a treadmill, it just flops right off. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=473.32s)]
*  I've watched videos on YouTube of this before. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=475.64s)]
*  They've injected puppies with cocaine. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=478.52s)]
*  What? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=481.76s)]
*  Now, the cocaine was pure. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  The puppies wanted to be injected, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  but it doesn't make it right, Dana. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  They were sticking marbles into cats' anuses [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=488.72s)]
*  and then electro-shocking them. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  These are the kinds of wicked experiments [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=494.12s)]
*  that the government is using your taxpayer on. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  There's more. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  What was the point of the marble? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=502.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=503.76000000000005s)]
*  Don't ask me. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=504.8s)]
*  I don't have this type of fetish. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=505.64000000000004s)]
*  They spent $3 million for the Department of Education [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=508.36s)]
*  to write a report to say that no one reads reports. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=512.36s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=515.64s)]
*  How about this? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=516.64s)]
*  $50 million to the Climate Justice Alliance [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=517.52s)]
*  who believes that climate justice [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=521.12s)]
*  travels through a free Palestine. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=523.16s)]
*  Do you know what that means? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=525.16s)]
*  I don't know what that means, Dana. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=526.16s)]
*  They spent 25 grand for shrinks [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=527.96s)]
*  for trans refugees in Greece. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=531.08s)]
*  Now, if you're in the trenches, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=534.12s)]
*  like we are in cable news, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=536.96s)]
*  we've been doing this a long time, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=538.16s)]
*  this is like free money, okay? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=540.08s)]
*  I can come out and I can read this every day of the week. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=542.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the Democrats say. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=545.48s)]
*  They have to defend this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=548.24s)]
*  And I haven't seen one single Democrat [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=549.16s)]
*  on any of these shows [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=551.08s)]
*  defending any of these kooky projects. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=552.36s)]
*  And every day we read this stuff and expose it [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  and they're not saying anything or defending it, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=557.76s)]
*  they're losing. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  And they've lost every single day since Doge started up. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  That's a good point [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  because the Democrats are demanding more transparency. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=567.6s)]
*  I'm not against it, but the more there's transparency, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=570.04s)]
*  the more kinds of things like that you find. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=572.4s)]
*  Well, all I know is when I get home, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=574.28s)]
*  I'm cleaning my marbles. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=575.92s)]
*  So Dean Phillips stepped out of the prison of two ideas [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=579.36s)]
*  where Harold lives. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=582.8s)]
*  It's the next step in the gradual enlightenment [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  that the Democrats must pursue, but most of them aren't. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  Right now, for these Democrats, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=590.76s)]
*  their only hope is that things go bad for Trump. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=592.5999999999999s)]
*  And you can see that already in the press [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=596.36s)]
*  as they're looking at the price of eggs. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=597.92s)]
*  But for bad things to go for Trump, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=599.88s)]
*  then things have to go bad for America [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=602.8s)]
*  because this entire plank is America first. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  So it's a terrible hope to have. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=609.4s)]
*  It doesn't really clear a path for a new vision [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=612.68s)]
*  when you just hope that things will go wrong [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=615.88s)]
*  and they're still clinging to this fantasy [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  that if Trump fails, then they can return to what exactly? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=619.92s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=625.04s)]
*  Woke is dead, identity politics is dead, DEI is dead, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=626.3599999999999s)]
*  open borders is dead, CNN, MSNBC, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=631.0s)]
*  all of legacy media is dead, dead, double dead. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=634.2s)]
*  Trump may well hit a snag at some point, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh6N8N4DJU&t=637.96s)]
