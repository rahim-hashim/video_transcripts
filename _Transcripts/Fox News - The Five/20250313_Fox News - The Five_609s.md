# 'The Five': Walz takes 'responsibility' while Trump tries to give Democrats 'advice'
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw)
*  Three days of master class and self-destruction for the Democratic Party, failing to connect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=0.0s)]
*  with the working man while flooding social media with TikToks that make you want to bleach [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=4.38s)]
*  your eyeballs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=8.28s)]
*  And it looks like it's about to get worse. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=9.88s)]
*  According to a new report, Democratic leadership has been hiring influencers to consult them [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  on how to keep it real and be meaner. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=17.2s)]
*  But John Fetterman and others are trying to inject some common sense before this train [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=20.1s)]
*  derails completely. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=23.88s)]
*  I would just, I was asked Democrats, like start talking like a regular person. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=26.0s)]
*  Most people are not sure what an oligarch is, you know? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=30.2s)]
*  Just be a real person. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=33.6s)]
*  How about that as a solution? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=34.6s)]
*  Instead of us being like, oh, well, I need to be, I need to be more authentic. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=36.6s)]
*  So I'm going to put a baseball cap on. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=40.8s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to drop some F, I'm going to sprinkle some F bombs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=42.72s)]
*  There's too much like pretentious finger wagon. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=46.0s)]
*  You need to get the working class back immediately. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=48.28s)]
*  And you're not going to get that back when you just got a bunch of these like super rich [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=50.0s)]
*  nepo babies telling poor people how they should think and who should they should vote [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=53.84s)]
*  for. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=57.24s)]
*  Speaking of 2028, Democrats are making early moves at a run. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  Tandem and Tim Walz looks hungry for a redo by taking responsibility for Kamala's failure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  I own this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=68.36s)]
*  We wouldn't be in this mess if we'd have won the election. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=69.36s)]
*  And we didn't. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=71.48s)]
*  We have to make sure that Americans know it's not just that Donald Trump is bad, but we're [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=72.48s)]
*  offering them something better. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=76.76s)]
*  And I think that's what we need to work on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=78.44s)]
*  I'm going to go out there and make sure that those folks down in Iowa know that their [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  rep doesn't want to come talk to him, but he voted for this stuff. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=83.4s)]
*  He voted to defund these things. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  So what's going on, Jessica? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what's going on? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Do tell. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  I think it's good that Tim Walz is out there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=98.4s)]
*  He's really out there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=99.4s)]
*  It's better than not confronting it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=100.4s)]
*  And he's taking responsibility, which people were asking for. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=102.56s)]
*  They wanted Biden to take responsibility. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=105.04s)]
*  Tim Walz. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=107.04s)]
*  Where's Kamala? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=108.04s)]
*  She's been out a couple of times, but is obviously not as visible. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  To the John Fetterman point, Bernie Sanders, who is an amazing authentic communicator for [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=115.36s)]
*  the party, uses the term oligarchy all the time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=120.92s)]
*  He does it in the Brooklyn accent, but he's still talking about the oligarchs. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=123.56s)]
*  And that works for people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  And I would argue, even though there have been some painful moments like the protest [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=128.36s)]
*  outside of the Department of Education, et cetera, that the Democratic messaging actually [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=133.16s)]
*  has been going pretty well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=137.36s)]
*  So talking about they're trying to cut your health care while giving tax breaks to the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=139.0s)]
*  rich. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=143.28s)]
*  If you look at the latest Quinnipiac poll, there's over 50 percent disapproval of Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=144.28s)]
*  himself, how he's handling the economy, how he's handling the federal workforce, how he's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=148.68s)]
*  handling Ukraine and Russia, how he's handling trade with Mexico, how he's handling trade [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=152.32s)]
*  with Canada. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=156.96s)]
*  So basically, he's underwater on everything. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=158.36s)]
*  And a lot of that is due to the fact that Democrats are out there at town halls like [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=160.94s)]
*  Jason Crow, for instance, held a town hall. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  He's a representative in Colorado. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=166.6s)]
*  1,300 people showed up to that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=168.72s)]
*  And there was tons of social feed that came out of that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  And we know about the Republicans having town halls and then having to run away or asking [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=173.32s)]
*  questions like, what do you think of Doge and expecting people to say something positive? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  And then they're screaming. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=180.88s)]
*  Where did they come from? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=181.88s)]
*  What? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=182.88s)]
*  Where did they come from? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=183.88s)]
*  This is OK. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=184.88s)]
*  So first of all, we know that the right wants to just tell you that everyone is fake. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=185.88s)]
*  First of all, even if they're a Democrat, they still can vote. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=189.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  And that matters. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  And second of all, you can't have this many plants. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  If you don't think that cutting tens of thousands of workers, if you have a plan to take away [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=196.6s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid isn't going to animate people, 2026 is going [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  to be pretty bleak. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=204.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=205.68s)]
*  So talking about a lot of polls, a lot of Quinnipiac polls. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=206.68s)]
*  It's a little early for the polls. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=210.24s)]
*  But I mean, the other poll that came out today, who was it? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=212.6s)]
*  Was it Quinnipiac that said congressional Democrats at its lowest ever at 21 percent [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=215.6s)]
*  approval, I think? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=219.84s)]
*  And Republicans were at 40 percent approval. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=221.04s)]
*  When I worked there in the mid 90s, that would have been actually a pretty good number for us. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=223.96s)]
*  So I think it's a little early for that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=229.4s)]
*  I do think that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, they were miles away from the people they say [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=231.44s)]
*  that they want to reach, the working class. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=237.76s)]
*  They focus on electric vehicle tax credits. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=239.48s)]
*  So for cars that already start fifteen to fifteen thousand or twenty thousand dollars more [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=243.2s)]
*  than your average car. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=247.52s)]
*  And then you could get a subsidy for that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=249.32s)]
*  They were also giving out all of those subsidies on green energy, climate stuff to people like [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Stacey Abrams, though they were enriching their friends. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  And now, as we were just showing with the protest earlier today, it's super organized [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=259.56s)]
*  and you trace that right back to the billionaire. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=264.36s)]
*  So it's like, well, what oligarchs like Bernie Sanders, they pick and choose the oligarchs [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=266.76s)]
*  that they like. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's not a good book. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=273.4s)]
*  Not a good look, Jessica. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=275.2s)]
*  You know what else is not a good look, Greg? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=276.2s)]
*  I see Federman and we like Federman. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=277.68s)]
*  OK, he's great. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=279.44s)]
*  Or kind of great. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=280.72s)]
*  He shows a lot of leg. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=282.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird when you're sitting. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=284.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of leg. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=285.8s)]
*  It's just a lot of man. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=287.0s)]
*  Well, then put a lot of pants on. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=289.04s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like it should be roofing, which is not a bad thing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  I go back to my first point in the block. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=295.36s)]
*  There's something to the persuasion of positive energy when someone is excited about something [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  that's coming in the future. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=301.72s)]
*  They're trying to tell you that the reward is going to make the effort worth it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=304.0s)]
*  It's like when your wife tries to get you to do yoga and she's constantly telling you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=307.92s)]
*  about the benefits of it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  It's to get you on board. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=313.88s)]
*  So you believe the effort is worth it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=315.8s)]
*  Trump does this with every single thing he does. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=318.36s)]
*  He plays it up. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=321.04s)]
*  There's all this energy to convince you that this is going to be the greatest thing we've [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=322.04s)]
*  ever done. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=326.36s)]
*  You are going to believe it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=327.36s)]
*  Compare that to like Biden or even the Democrats out just complete lethargy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=328.88s)]
*  When Biden used to talk about the future, you got so depressed, even when he was trying [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=334.36s)]
*  to lift your spirits, it was like, what is this corpse saying? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=340.52s)]
*  Get me out of here. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=343.96s)]
*  You know, he's given the best advice to the Dems besides us. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=344.96s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=348.64s)]
*  He's showing them what matters. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=349.64s)]
*  You know, the Dems got steered into a morass of punitive identity politics. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=351.24s)]
*  Everything became race, gender, trans. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump comes on, redirects their priorities, whether you like it or not. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=359.12s)]
*  If you want to stay on trans, go for it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=363.88s)]
*  But he says, OK, economy, border, war, crime, taxpayer abuse. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=366.24s)]
*  Smart Democrats understand that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=371.96s)]
*  They go like, OK, that's cold water in the face. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  Even like so he he has a strategy of redirecting attention. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  And sometimes it can be really confusing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=381.56s)]
*  Like, you know, tariffs aren't his priority. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=383.88s)]
*  He makes it a priority for the other country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  And the bigger message is, how can we create allies [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=390.92s)]
*  for a better economic relationship? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=395.8s)]
*  That's the bigger story. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=398.0s)]
*  But you think, oh, my God, it's about tariffs. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=399.16s)]
*  No, that's their problem. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=400.44s)]
*  So he's constantly doing this and you're moving forward. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=401.96s)]
*  You have an aim and the aim, as Jordan Peterson says, creates the frame. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=405.24s)]
*  But the tariffs are our problem because it will be a tax on us. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=410.0s)]
*  No, it's not. You don't understand. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=413.08s)]
*  That's why I'm here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=414.2s)]
*  We're not going to talk about that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=415.2s)]
*  Really? Every economist has it wrong? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=417.2s)]
*  Every economist. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=419.44s)]
*  OK, I'm sure Harold told you they were also a tax on the consumer. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=420.88s)]
*  They're not a tax on the consumer. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=424.08s)]
*  If you buy the... Oh, you just don't buy any product. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=425.44s)]
*  You know what? There you go. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=427.76s)]
*  You know what? You walked right into it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  If you buy the product. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=430.84s)]
*  Just say buy American, Jessica. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  By your definition, the wages that you pay the worker [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  who makes the product is also a tax. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=437.12s)]
*  This is a joke. The idea that you're just... [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=439.84s)]
*  We're not laughing, Jessica. You missed yesterday. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  We do want to get you judged, Sinead. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=443.64s)]
*  We do want to get you judged. Here's the bottom line. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=445.56s)]
*  It's about American protectionism. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  It's about protecting American workers, American factories, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=449.20000000000005s)]
*  making sure that Americans can buy things like masks that don't come from China, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=452.76000000000005s)]
*  medicine that doesn't come from China, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=456.92s)]
*  supply chain that we create over here, which is about Nippon investing in steel, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  and then putting our tariffs... [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  This is about reciprocal tariffs, not retaliatory. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=464.68s)]
*  But let me go to this particular topic. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=468.12s)]
*  Look, I got to tell you, John Fetterman, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=470.76000000000005s)]
*  someone told me that he still is using an iPad. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=473.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  I got to tell you, I am so impressed with this guy. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=477.0s)]
*  He makes more sense than just about all the Democrats who are at full capacity. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=480.76s)]
*  He's right when he says oligarch doesn't mean anything to anybody [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=487.56s)]
*  other than you're talking to each other about things. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=492.44s)]
*  The Democrats don't know how to talk about regular people, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=495.88s)]
*  and I have a recommendation to them. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=498.67999999999995s)]
*  The... [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=500.68s)]
*  What they need to do is they need to be worried about Americans and not about other people. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=502.76s)]
*  The first segment we did was about, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=509.0s)]
*  oh, Mahmoud, where are his constitutional rights? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=510.76s)]
*  This guy who believes in tearing down America, hates Jews, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=513.8s)]
*  and everything else that we talked about. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=516.52s)]
*  That's where the Democrats are going to go. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=518.2s)]
*  Okay? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=520.2s)]
*  How do you get the American public to believe that you give a damn about the American working public [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=521.4s)]
*  when you're over there for the men and women's sports and people with pronouns, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=527.24s)]
*  and Mahmoud who wants to tear down Western civilization, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=532.84s)]
*  who believes in Hamas and is organizing with Hamas? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=536.92s)]
*  You lost us and you earned it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=540.28s)]
*  And I don't buy for one second that Tim Walsh, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=542.52s)]
*  you know, I own it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=546.12s)]
*  Is that what he said? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=547.64s)]
*  I own this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=548.52s)]
*  No, Tim, you didn't take responsibility for it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=549.64s)]
*  You know, it's not just that Trump's bad. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=552.84s)]
*  We're offering something better. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=555.64s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=557.0s)]
*  You're not offering anything better. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=557.8s)]
*  And until you get a policy and not just a message [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=559.48s)]
*  where you have to hire comedians to show you how to be funny, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=562.6s)]
*  or you have to figure out that, gee, maybe you ought to get a podcast [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=566.52s)]
*  because a lot of men like to listen to sports podcasts or comedies, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=569.72s)]
*  and women listen to podcasts too. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=573.48s)]
*  You're nothing more than performative politicians who will never connect with Americans. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=575.4s)]
*  Jesse, isn't it interesting that it takes brain damage to make a Democrat normal? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=581.64s)]
*  Who would you say is more normal, Jessica or Federman? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=586.36s)]
*  Let's not even answer that question. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=590.28s)]
*  Let's really talk about it in the break. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=592.68s)]
*  Let's talk about it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=593.96s)]
*  We'll just kind of do a roundtable. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_QUzg42Gw&t=595.08s)]
