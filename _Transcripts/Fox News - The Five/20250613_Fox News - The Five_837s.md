# ‘The Five’: Iran awoke this ‘not-so-sleeping giant’ on October 7
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo)
*  Hello everybody, I'm Martha McCallum along with Katie Pavlich, Jessica Tarlov, Charlie [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=0.0s)]
*  Hurt and Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=6.32s)]
*  It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  You need to get ready to pull it off the sticks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=14.4s)]
*  Get off the sticks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=22.96s)]
*  Alright, let's go. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=23.96s)]
*  Time to go. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=24.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=25.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=27.96s)]
*  Guys, come on, everyone move. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=28.96s)]
*  Everyone move now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=32.36s)]
*  Jaw dropping images and moments this afternoon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=34.08s)]
*  Iran unleashing a barrage of missiles against Israel, coming really in three waves. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=37.52s)]
*  Israel bracing for more tonight and more days of conflict as well. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=43.56s)]
*  With that we bring in Trey Yanks live from Tel Aviv for the very latest on the street [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=47.24s)]
*  there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=52.08s)]
*  He has just been to one of the areas that was damaged in these attacks. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=53.08s)]
*  High tribe. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=56.68s)]
*  Yeah, Martha, good afternoon. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=57.68s)]
*  Overnight the Israelis launched widespread strikes against Iranian targets, hitting the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=60.6s)]
*  country's nuclear facilities and also targeting their top nuclear scientists and members of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=65.36s)]
*  the IRGC. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=71.32s)]
*  The Iranians have responded to those ongoing strikes with a ballistic missile attack against [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=72.32s)]
*  Israel in two separate waves, around a hundred missiles striking the central part of this [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=78.76s)]
*  country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=84.12s)]
*  You can see they are still taking injured people out of this area of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=85.16s)]
*  It's a densely populated, both commercial and residential area. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=89.2s)]
*  We've seen children being taken from here, one elderly woman and even pets. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=92.88s)]
*  As the Israelis are preparing for the possibility of more Iranian retaliation, we do understand [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  they are continuing strikes against Iran. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=103.32s)]
*  Tonight, the IDF telling Fox News that the Israelis struck a number of Iranian air bases [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=105.64s)]
*  defense system outside of the capital of Tehran. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=112.88s)]
*  We just received a press release from the top medical facility in Israel that is coordinating [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  the evacuations of the injured from this ballistic missile attack that you saw live on Fox. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=122.72s)]
*  They say 34 people were injured from strikes in this area. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=127.8s)]
*  One woman is in critical condition, others taken to local hospitals. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=131.56s)]
*  But again, tonight Israel is bracing for the possibility of more ballistic missile attacks [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=135.2s)]
*  as this country is now in a direct conflict with the Iranian regime. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  Martha? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you very much. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's take it around the table and get reaction to what we were watching unfold this afternoon. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=147.96s)]
*  Katie, let me start with you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  It was clear that Israel felt for some time, I think, that the moment had to be now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  You had really Israel had depleted Iran's defensive capabilities along the border and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  had taken out so much of their leadership. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  Iran, understanding that, I think was getting closer and closer to a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=169.68s)]
*  Well, the Iranians have been waging this war for 50 years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=173.44s)]
*  This is not something new for the Iranian regime. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=176.56s)]
*  The Israelis have done the legwork over the last really two years to make sure that this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=180.0s)]
*  was a success. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=184.82s)]
*  They took out Hezbollah, which is Iran's most heavily armed, most sophisticated terrorist [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=186.0s)]
*  organization in Lebanon. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=190.6s)]
*  They've done a number on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=192.32s)]
*  They took out their air defenses last October, and they've also been able to help the people [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  in Iran who are against the regime not only try and topple the leadership there that has [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  been so oppressive to them, but also been able to turn many of them into assets for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=206.54s)]
*  the Mossad and for their intelligence agencies to be able to go in ahead of time and get [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=212.32s)]
*  rid of a number of assets in terms of the ballistic missile launching pads, cyber attacks, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=216.56s)]
*  knowing where these military leaders were last night, the fact that the Israelis got [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=222.52s)]
*  rid of the entire top line essentially of the military commanders in Iran in a matter [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=227.4s)]
*  of six or seven hours. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=233.64s)]
*  It's very clear that the Iranian people hate the regime as much as the Israelis do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=235.5s)]
*  And so they've laid the groundwork here for this to be a success. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=241.24s)]
*  The bottom line is that the Iranians have been given time after time after time, many [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=244.52s)]
*  different presidential administrations in the United States to make good on coming to a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  deal in good faith. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=254.84s)]
*  During the Iran deal under Obama, they lied their way through that deal, which is why [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=256.68s)]
*  President Trump pulled them out of it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  President Trump said 61, 62 days ago, I'm giving you a deadline. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=262.88s)]
*  If you want to come to the table and have a real discussion about this, we don't want [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=266.92s)]
*  to end this violently. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  If you don't, things are going to happen. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=271.4s)]
*  He's not a bluffer. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=274.24s)]
*  And the Israelis got the green light and they have to defend their country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=276.38s)]
*  And one more thing I would just say is this is about preventing a nuclear war. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=280.82s)]
*  There's a lot of talk about, oh, people are starting a war. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=285.46s)]
*  This is about preventing nuclear proliferation in a region where all of the Arab states around [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=287.58s)]
*  Israel may not say it publicly, but they are happy that this is happening today because [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=294.1s)]
*  they are all on the side of taking out the regime. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=298.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=301.9s)]
*  Russia, I thought it was very ironic that Putin volunteered to run the negotiations [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=303.85999999999996s)]
*  for a ceasefire. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=308.58s)]
*  I mean, between these two, I think he's got his own problems. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=309.58s)]
*  And President Trump does not like war. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=313.17999999999995s)]
*  He doesn't want war. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=315.52s)]
*  And he made that very clear to the leadership in Iran. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=317.38s)]
*  He said, make a deal. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=320.34s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=321.34s)]
*  You just have to be provably not pursuing a nuclear weapons program and you can pursue [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=322.34s)]
*  a great economy in your country. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=327.14s)]
*  Jessica, explain why Elizabeth Warren, Tim Kaine come out lashing out against Israel [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=329.38s)]
*  for taking this action. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=335.86s)]
*  I thought it was very interesting that Tim Kaine, Senator Kaine said, why are they launching [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=336.86s)]
*  a military attack before a diplomatic discussion? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=340.74s)]
*  What? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=343.94s)]
*  I am in such awe of the IDF and Mossad and that's where I want to begin. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=347.62s)]
*  And this was so precise that you can look at the buildings that they went into and you [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=354.3s)]
*  see a little hole and then it went straight into the nuclear scientist's bedroom, took [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=362.3s)]
*  him. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=367.06s)]
*  Then you see a little hole and it went into the room where they had managed to get all [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=368.06s)]
*  of the IRGC commanders. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  At a thousand miles away. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=373.42s)]
*  A thousand miles away. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=375.06s)]
*  And the footage of the soldiers, the Israeli soldiers on the ground risking their lives [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  who've been stationed over there to be able to pull this off. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=383.62s)]
*  I just we are going to see a new season of Tehran, homeland, whatever it is between this [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=386.94s)]
*  and Project Grim Beeper. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=393.66s)]
*  I don't know if that's a formal name and shout out as well to the Ukrainians for the Spider [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  Web operation as well for what they pulled off. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=400.58000000000004s)]
*  You've seen the might and the will of people trying to defend themselves and their sovereign [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=402.94s)]
*  nations coming to life in spectacular fashion. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=411.38s)]
*  And so I think that's where everyone should begin with this. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=414.38s)]
*  You can't look at what happened last night from the Israeli side. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=416.82s)]
*  And I know that we will have a larger discussion about what this turns into. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=420.46s)]
*  But there are no civilian casualties here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=423.82s)]
*  Right. Everyone who was taken out was a terrorist and everyone who was taken out is responsible [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=426.26s)]
*  not only for Israeli deaths but American deaths as well. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=430.86s)]
*  So I don't want to hear anything like what are we doing or there's going to be a diplomatic [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=434.7s)]
*  negotiation. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=440.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=441.98s)]
*  But their hand had been minimized over the last several months. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=442.98s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting to think back to October 7th and how powerful they all thought [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=447.58s)]
*  that they seemed. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if they would take it back because they killed a bunch of Jews. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=453.3s)]
*  And that is a top priority for them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  But look what the Middle East looks like today compared to October 6th. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=458.3s)]
*  I think there are some folks who well, they're dead. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=462.98s)]
*  So they definitely would want to go into a time machine. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=465.42s)]
*  But who would want to go back in time and say, well, maybe we should just lay off a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=467.62s)]
*  little bit and figure out a different approach to that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=470.42s)]
*  That is how I'm feeling today. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=472.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they awoke a not so sleeping giant on October 7th, Charlie. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=474.66s)]
*  And I think that it was such a painful for them intelligence failure October 7th that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=480.90000000000003s)]
*  they have worked so hard to do these meticulous operations that Jessica outlines. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=486.18s)]
*  And it is stunning. And I find it interesting that there are Democrats who are trying to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  search for ways to support this country that chants death to America or this leadership, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=496.02s)]
*  I should say, and has so many people in it that want them gone. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=500.65999999999997s)]
*  Unless you're Tim Walz and then you find some way to give credit to the Chinese, which is [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=504.62s)]
*  absolutely baffling. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=509.46s)]
*  But you know, it is it is a we're kind of used to seeing these surgical strikes by the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=511.41999999999996s)]
*  IDF and Mossad. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=517.34s)]
*  The depth and breadth of this is kind of shocking. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=519.14s)]
*  The surgical nature of it, because they did manage to avoid, as best we can tell, pretty [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=522.14s)]
*  much any civilian casualties whatsoever. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=529.06s)]
*  I also think that it's important to kind of step back and look at the big picture. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=532.18s)]
*  And you think about the fact that that Israel is on the offense here and you have Iran on [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=536.26s)]
*  the defense. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=542.3s)]
*  If you look back over the past 20 years, you've had two administrations, Barack Obama and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=543.3s)]
*  then Joe Biden, who continued the Obama policies where they really did everything they could [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=548.1s)]
*  to sort of encourage and promote Iran's leadership in the Middle East. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=553.5400000000001s)]
*  And then you and of course, Joe Biden, when he became president, was the most highly regarded [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=559.86s)]
*  diplomat around the world. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=567.02s)]
*  And he brought nothing but war and mayhem. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=569.78s)]
*  And then you take a guy like Donald Trump, who had no diplomatic experience whatsoever, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=572.94s)]
*  and managed to put up extraordinary achievements in his first term, including giving us the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=577.6999999999999s)]
*  Abraham Accords and finding a piece that would have seemed unimaginable for decades before [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=583.38s)]
*  that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=590.5s)]
*  And very much put, and I think that as much as anything, was the cause of the October [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=591.5s)]
*  7th attack because Iran and their proxies in the Middle East realized that we were looking [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=597.62s)]
*  at maybe Saudi Arabia and Israel coming together in a way that no one thought was possible. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=605.42s)]
*  And so they had to lash out. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=611.14s)]
*  And I see all of this as kind of a continuation of that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=612.62s)]
*  And I think that President Trump tried to kind of keep it at arm's length. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=615.46s)]
*  They talked about last night, Marco Rubio said that this was a unilateral action by [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=619.42s)]
*  Israel. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=624.06s)]
*  Obviously, they knew what was going on. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=625.54s)]
*  But the idea that you have this going on that we see on the camera, and then you see President [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=629.54s)]
*  Trump still standing there outside of Iran saying, but the door to peace is open. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=635.38s)]
*  Come to us and we will negotiate. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=639.5400000000001s)]
*  And I just think that it's common sense. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=643.9s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=647.7800000000001s)]
*  He's not a war guy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=648.7800000000001s)]
*  And I think this is the greatest chance at peace that we've ever imagined in 20 years. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=651.46s)]
*  The potential for a reset in the Middle East is pretty large right now. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=659.14s)]
*  Greg, what do you think when you look at all this? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=663.46s)]
*  Well, you can't say Trump didn't warn Iran. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=665.14s)]
*  I mean, he said 60 days and today was or yesterday was 61. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=667.0600000000001s)]
*  So they were on their own. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=672.34s)]
*  Trump is like the friend of an MMA fighter at a bar who's being harassed by a drunk [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=673.34s)]
*  guy and Trump's trying to help out the drunk guy saying, dude, may not be a good idea to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=678.02s)]
*  mess with this guy. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=682.82s)]
*  I know he looks small, but looks could be deceiving. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=684.02s)]
*  That's what he was telling Iran. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=687.86s)]
*  He was basically saying, you know, we're giving you a chance here. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=688.86s)]
*  They ignored him and like the drunk, they got their asses kicked. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=692.42s)]
*  I'm with Jessica on the IDF, but I have to, you know, it is. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=695.42s)]
*  You know, whether you're for this, I don't know, this engagement or not, you just go, wow. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=701.54s)]
*  You know, whether it was the beepers, you can go all the way back to the radon and Tebby. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=709.9399999999999s)]
*  It's like you're watching a professional billiards player pull off an impossible trick [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=713.82s)]
*  shot and without touching another ball, but the one they sunk. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=718.66s)]
*  And it's the polar opposite of Israel's enemies who use blunt force, indiscriminate of innocence, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=722.9s)]
*  whether it's October 7th or even these wayward missile strikes from Iran. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=729.22s)]
*  You know, it's like Israel uses a scalpel, their enemies use a mallet and they do the, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=733.42s)]
*  and they have to. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=739.8199999999999s)]
*  Now, you know, what is it? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=742.46s)]
*  It still bugs me though. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=745.66s)]
*  What is it about Israel and the IDF that is so offensive to say the Jewish left in America [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=746.66s)]
*  or let's say the white liberals in general, Jessica notwithstanding, a nice exception. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=753.38s)]
*  David Mamet talks about it in his book, The Unenlightenment. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=759.54s)]
*  It challenges their belief of passivity. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=763.26s)]
*  They believe that, you know, in the face of people who don't like you to discourage attack, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=767.38s)]
*  you just kind of get along. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=772.78s)]
*  You submit. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=774.18s)]
*  And Jews have been doing that for a long time. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=776.06s)]
*  You would think October 7th would have changed all that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=778.76s)]
*  And it felt like it did. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=782.5s)]
*  But then time heals all outrages and we saw it on our campuses. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=784.2s)]
*  There's no bottom to this passivity. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=788.74s)]
*  It just keeps going. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=791.06s)]
*  And it's there in the face of radical Islam. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=793.14s)]
*  It was also there in the face of identity politics. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=795.3s)]
*  If you were deemed responsible for oppression, you know, our white leaders would bow down [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=798.16s)]
*  before it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=804.14s)]
*  We were bad, you know, but the IDF in Israel, when you look at it, whether you were for [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=805.14s)]
*  it or against it, they challenged this world view that you have to be passive. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=811.02s)]
*  You shouldn't be Woody Allen. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=816.28s)]
*  You should be Max Bayer. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=817.8s)]
*  You know, in Israel, it's a battle. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=819.52s)]
*  In America, you can have the TED Talks. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=822.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=825.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=826.14s)]
*  We're going to be back with more of the breaking news out of Israel in just a moment as Iran [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=827.14s)]
*  unleashes a barrage of missiles into Israel. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQBNwZvlRo&t=832.94s)]
