*  No, it's because she was a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=62.3s)]

*  Come on. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=69.5s)]
*  We know. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=70.2s)]
*  Literally an ego trip. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=71.2s)]

*  You'll come around. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=83.1s)]
*  I actually respect what's going [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=84.7s)]
*  on with her. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=87.1s)]
*  Come on. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  She's the only celebrity that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=88.6s)]
*  actually put her mouth where [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  she put it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=92.6s)]
*  Followed through. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  Whatever that stupid saying is. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=94.0s)]
*  She's followed through. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=95.69999999999999s)]
*  Come on. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  We've all been saying when you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=98.0s)]
*  gonna leave? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  When are you gonna leave? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=99.3s)]
*  When are you gonna leave the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=99.8s)]
*  country? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, she finally did it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=100.8s)]
*  So you know what? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=101.8s)]
*  Add a girl. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=103.0s)]
*  Add a girl. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=103.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  I wonder why she chose Ireland, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  Judge. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=106.3s)]
*  I don't know why she chose on [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=107.0s)]
*  maybe some potatoes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=109.89999999999999s)]
*  I mean, she says she moved to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=110.8s)]
*  Ireland to get away from Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=112.5s)]
*  I mean, she's still posting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=114.3s)]
*  about Donald Trump. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  I mean, she's suffering from [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=116.8s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=117.9s)]
*  She needs to be deprogrammed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=121.30000000000001s)]
*  Harold, are we gonna have to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=121.9s)]
*  leave for Ireland? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  I agree with Jesse. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=124.7s)]
*  I give her credit. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=126.5s)]
*  She said what she was gonna do [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  and she did it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=129.1s)]
*  I gave her credit for that too. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  So you have to agree with me [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=130.4s)]
*  too. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=131.4s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you too. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=131.9s)]
*  It's such mundane commentary. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=134.3s)]
*  Oh, we agree. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=137.70000000000002s)]
*  You're so enlightened. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=139.0s)]
*  Oh, I agree with her. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  Oh, shut up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=142.5s)]
*  She's lying to you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  She's not leaving because of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=146.0s)]
*  her. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=147.0s)]
*  By the way, if you keep your [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=147.4s)]
*  home in America, you're not [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=148.5s)]
*  moving. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=150.0s)]
*  That's a second home. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=150.7s)]
*  It's a second home. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=151.8s)]
*  You know what you get when you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=152.8s)]
*  go there? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=153.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=154.2s)]
*  Big tax breaks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=154.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=155.8s)]
*  Up next, Gavin Newsom reportedly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=157.0s)]
*  funded a statue of himself. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyLJOWffnDI&t=158.8s)]
