# ‘The Five’ unpacks Trump’s 'bold' message to University of Alabama graduates
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI)
*  President Trump giving a rock star commencement speech at the University of Alabama, imparting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=0.0s)]
*  his pearls of wisdom to the class of 2025 and hailing them as the lucky first graduates [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=6.0s)]
*  of the Golden Age. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  You've done a lot of winning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=14.8s)]
*  Winning is a good thing to do. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=16.26s)]
*  But today I'm also asking you to look forward to really something very, very bright and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=18.96s)]
*  more promising. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=24.92s)]
*  You're the first graduating class of the Golden Age of America. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  It is clear to see the next chapter of the American story will not be written by the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=30.44s)]
*  Harvard Crimson. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=36.68s)]
*  It will be written by you, the Crimson Tide. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=38.28s)]
*  In America we reject that idea that anyone who is born a victim or heroes are the ones [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=41.6s)]
*  who take charge of their own destiny, make their own luck, and determine their own fate [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=46.86s)]
*  despite the odds. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=54.08s)]
*  You're one of a kind, so don't try to be someone else. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=55.36s)]
*  Just be yourself. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=59.6s)]
*  President Trump was also spicing things up with some of his classic rally zingers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=61.8s)]
*  Elon is so terrific, but I know now all of them, you know, they all hated me in my first [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=68.16s)]
*  term and now they're kissing my ass, you know? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=73.72s)]
*  It's true. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  You ever see the weightlifting where they have a record that wasn't broken in 18 years [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  and they have? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  Should I imitate it? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, my wife gets very upset when I do this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  And she gets it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=88.64s)]
*  Mom, I'm going to do it, Mom. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=91.64s)]
*  Can't do it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=96.0s)]
*  He had a wife, I must tell you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  It was a second wife. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  It was a trophy wife. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  What can I say? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  If anyone can deliver a message and mesmerize a crowd, it's Donald Trump and he knows how [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=109.88s)]
*  to work a crowd when he talks about, should I say it? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=116.08s)]
*  My wife doesn't like when I say it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=118.88s)]
*  What do you think, Martha? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=120.6s)]
*  Well, you know, I was watching some of the other networks talk about this today and they [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  were saying, you know, where was the commencement speech? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=126.32s)]
*  You know, they only played that stuff. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=128.92s)]
*  There was no commencement speech. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=130.76s)]
*  And then I listened to the top of what we just played. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=131.76s)]
*  There was absolutely a commencement speech message in there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=134.22s)]
*  Everybody's saying, you know, if you go the safe route, don't go the safe route. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=139.16s)]
*  If you want to go to the top, you're never going to do it unless you break the system. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it was very, I think that, you know, some people might like it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=147.16s)]
*  Some people might not like it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=150.56s)]
*  But the message was clearly merit is what wins. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=151.88s)]
*  Be bold. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, don't sit back. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Be part of this next generation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=158.2s)]
*  We reject the idea that anyone is born a victim. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=160.12s)]
*  Our heroes are the ones who take charge of their own destiny, make their own luck, determine [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=162.8s)]
*  their own fate despite the odds. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=167.72s)]
*  And then he encouraged them to build things. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=169.84s)]
*  Don't just build a portfolio. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=172.16s)]
*  Go out there and build buildings, build manufacturing sites. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=173.8s)]
*  And so I think the message was was very clear. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=176.8s)]
*  I also think that you look at the message about the Ivy League and the next leaders [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=180.44s)]
*  are not going to come from Harvard, from the Harvard Crimson. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=184.56s)]
*  They're going to come from the Crimson Tide. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=187.28s)]
*  We see this. We see people across the country disappointed with the Ivy League [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  universities, people who went there disappointed by them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=193.44s)]
*  So they're looking for these other schools and they're seeing that you can get a great [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=197.2s)]
*  education and that you can do something bold going to these other schools. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=200.88s)]
*  I think it's a very weak moment for Harvard and the others. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=204.32s)]
*  And there's a lot of alumni who are not going to send them money anymore. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  And Trump's trying to break them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=211.28s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=212.88s)]
*  But, you know, I thought this was there was a lot of commencement inspiration in there [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=214.68s)]
*  for if you looked for it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=219.88s)]
*  You know, the president's speech, Jesse, was very optimistic. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=220.96s)]
*  It was very promising. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=224.68s)]
*  He talked about these young graduates being the what the greatest generation of America. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=226.04s)]
*  But I want you to listen to this sound of Joe Biden's last commencement speech. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=231.4s)]
*  Well, that's my commitment to you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=237.6s)]
*  To show you democracy, democracy, democracy is still the way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=240.16s)]
*  The black matter being killed in the street, we bear witness for me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=246.0s)]
*  That means to call out the poison of white supremacy, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=250.04s)]
*  through it out, systemic racism. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=254.11999999999998s)]
*  Is that so different? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=257.8s)]
*  Yeah, so usually when you're at your graduation ceremony, you have your parents, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=258.68s)]
*  you have your grandparents, you have your family there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  Do you want to hear the speaker talk about racism and how you can't do things and how [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=265.32s)]
*  you're fighting white supremacy? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=269.96s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=271.48s)]
*  When I graduated by the skin of my teeth, because I was checking to see if there was [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  actually a diploma in there, we had Joe Lieberman as my speaker. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=277.88s)]
*  Not as charismatic, but the message was good. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=281.56s)]
*  And it was a similar message to Donald Trump. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=283.96s)]
*  And you're right, Martha. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=285.88s)]
*  For me, I took away it was about competition. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=286.76s)]
*  And he mentioned the fact that Barack Obama, Hussein Obama, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=289.32s)]
*  told him at the Correspondence Center, Donald Trump's never going to be president. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=292.68s)]
*  And there's a lot of teams that during the week if an opposing team says something derogatory [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=296.12s)]
*  about you, they'll put the quote up in the locker room and everybody will look at it [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=302.12s)]
*  before they go out into the practice field. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=306.04s)]
*  And it's motivation fuel. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=307.64s)]
*  And he took that fuel and he ran with it and became president not once but twice. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  About a year and a half ago, Gutfeld said, Jesse Waters is boring. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=314.44s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=317.96s)]
*  I did. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=318.44s)]
*  I plastered it above my door in my office. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=318.84s)]
*  And every time I walk to hair and makeup, I see it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=320.91999999999996s)]
*  And he motivates me. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  The Harvard Crimson, Crimson Tide thing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  Kevin O'Leary says he doesn't hire people from the Ivy Leagues unless they played sports. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  Because they're just toxic and you can't trust them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  And so Jesse Waters is now doing early decision, Crimson Tide. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  We're not doing Ivies anymore. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=342.28s)]
*  And that's not just because he's not doing well so far in pre-K. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  It's just because I want to go to a school with nice weather, good football team, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  good values. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think there should be attractive women there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=351.96s)]
*  From what I've heard, there's very attractive women. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=354.36s)]
*  We're actually having two Crimson Tide grads on the show tonight at 8. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=356.52s)]
*  And they're both womenized. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=360.36s)]
*  I don't know if they're women or not. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  I haven't checked. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=363.64s)]
*  Do you want to respond to what he said? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=363.96s)]
*  I'm going to. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=365.4s)]
*  I am disgusted by everybody here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  When he was doing this thing, clearly he was mocking a disabled reporter. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=368.84s)]
*  And we're going to hear about that Monday on Morning Joe. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=375.64s)]
*  You're right, dude. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=378.28s)]
*  That happened at the University of Alabama. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=379.4s)]
*  Good for the University of Alabama. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=381.56s)]
*  It's a great advertisement for them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=383.0s)]
*  This is why a lot of students are going south. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=384.59999999999997s)]
*  They're seeing all the southern universities are getting more people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  And what a contrast. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=389.96s)]
*  What did we see this week? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=392.12s)]
*  Kamala babbling about pachyderms. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=394.04s)]
*  Tim Waltz spouting queer studies lingo like code talk and performative structure. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=396.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, here's a guy who happily speaks the truth. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=402.20000000000005s)]
*  And he's willing to bear the risk and whatever consequences his words bring. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=405.56s)]
*  It would have been nice if a Democrat could do that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=411.72s)]
*  They could have been honest and blunt. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  They had plenty of time about Joe Biden, about trans, about the border, about crime. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=415.88s)]
*  But instead, they hid themselves behind the science of identity politics and the rhetoric, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=421.08s)]
*  that dumb rhetoric that Waltz uses. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=426.12s)]
*  Trump didn't just set the bar for presidents and leaders. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  He burned it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  He set it on fire. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=432.12s)]
*  Then he built a new bar. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=433.56s)]
*  It's no longer about politics. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=434.91999999999996s)]
*  It's about persuasion. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=436.44s)]
*  It's no longer about us versus them. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  It's about us first. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=439.96s)]
*  It's about transparency versus cover-ups, bluntness versus jargon. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  The guy won't kiss babies and he won't kiss asses. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=446.68s)]
*  But more than anything, he makes us laugh. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=450.36s)]
*  And unlike Biden, it's with him, not at him. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=453.32s)]
*  Would you like to wrap it up, Harold? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=457.72s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=459.16s)]
*  I thought any student in the country who has an opportunity to have the president of the United [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=459.48s)]
*  States speak at his or her commencement, college, high school, law school, medical, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=465.24s)]
*  whatever it might be, it's a blessing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=470.04s)]
*  And I hope that those at the University of Alabama realize how fortunate they are. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=472.36s)]
*  I thought the speech was typical President Trump. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=476.35999999999996s)]
*  I would have probably done it a little differently. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=479.96s)]
*  I differ with those around the table about what he talked about with Harvard and Alabama. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=482.52s)]
*  I understand some of the cute politics at the moment, but great graduation speeches [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=486.44s)]
*  and commencement addresses never pit Americans versus Americans. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  You can talk about the high ideals and you can talk about the hard things we have to do [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=494.12s)]
*  as a country. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=497.32s)]
*  I would love the president to have said, look, you graduated at a time at the beginning of my [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=498.12s)]
*  new golden age and there may be some challenge and difficulty, but there's been challenging [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=502.44s)]
*  difficulty in our country in the past and we've overcome it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  I'd have talked about the new sources of energy that this group is going to have to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  deal with, produce for us, new cures and new therapeutics and new innovation that they will [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=512.36s)]
*  be at the forefront of. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=516.52s)]
*  So I would have challenged him a little differently. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  I just don't think you pit people against one another. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=520.04s)]
*  Let me just finish. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  But if I were graduating, I know the West Point grads are going to have an opportunity [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=523.16s)]
*  to hear the president. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=527.16s)]
*  That's something you would always want and always treasure, knowing that he was your [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=528.6s)]
*  commencement speaker. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=531.8s)]
*  So when Biden pit Americans against Americans, you didn't like that either. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  Judge, I'm consistent. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=538.52s)]
*  I call balls and strikes. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=539.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  I didn't and I don't now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=542.68s)]
*  Ahead, Elon Musk and the Doge Boys will blow your mind with the billions of wasteful crap [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  they've exposed. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=549.16s)]
*  Jesse has the scoop. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDQAng_YHI&t=550.1999999999999s)]
