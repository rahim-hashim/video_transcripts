# Dems are like a ‘weak loud-mouth at the bar’: Gutfeld
**Fox News - The Five:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY)
*  The other path Democrats can take? Full blown communism. Far left allies of Zoran the Destroyer, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=0.0s)]
*  one of primary Hakeem Jeffries and other New York City Democrats. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=6.4s)]
*  But James Carville's lurking in the shadows, trying to save his party from the commie takeover. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=10.16s)]
*  This fact that he won't denounce the global... Globalizing Fattata thing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=17.04s)]
*  Yeah, man. Come on, man. That's a concern. Just get it out your mouth. He's been given every [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=20.88s)]
*  opportunity to walk it back. So I am quite befuddled by it. It is troubling. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=25.76s)]
*  I need sunglasses to watch Carville. Maybe you should walk toward that light. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=35.68s)]
*  How's Gavin doing down there in South Carolina? Well, number one, you said the Democrats are a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=41.2s)]
*  dumpster fire. They are not because at least the dumpster fire produces heat. They do not. The [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=46.56s)]
*  problem with the Democrats right now is the hoax apparatus is broken. In the days you could rely [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=51.68s)]
*  on a big hoax, you know, collusion or the fine people hoax or drinking bleach, and the media [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=56.72s)]
*  would do their work for you. Right? But now, you know, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC, they're [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=62.64s)]
*  lower than Jasmine Crockett's SAT scores. Their credibility is on par with Smollett. So the Dems [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=68.4s)]
*  almost have to do their own work now. They actually have to use what's called their brains [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=74.88s)]
*  because their friends aren't fighting their battles anymore. The Democrats were like a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=79.44s)]
*  weak loudmouth at the bar who realized all of his buddies have left after he picked a fight with a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=84.24s)]
*  bunch of bikers. They don't know what to do. They can't think of anything. Harold's party [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=90.08s)]
*  is in a hole so deep they could shake hands with President Xi. You can go down there. And it's a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=96.72s)]
*  failed political institution, so it's no wonder that, you know, they think violence is an [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=102.56s)]
*  option. And Gavin, this trans thing is hilarious. One minute he's pro-woman, the next he's selling [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=108.96s)]
*  him down the river. He's actually trans. And what is this trans community that he keeps talking about? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  Show me your trans community. Oh, you're going to show me some kids? That's a lie, and it's illegal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=122.08s)]
*  now. You're going to show me activists, your loudest voices? Those are cosplaying male fetishists. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  So for but just a tiny fraction, what he says is a trans community is not real. He's just a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  coward who can't say that in public. And we will have Jasmine Crockett's SAT scores on primetime [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=142.32s)]
*  tonight. Tune in. You don't believe me? No, I'm still laughing about that China joke. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  You got to dig a hole to China. Everyone does it. Did you do that on the farm growing up, Dana? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Dig a hole to China? Yeah, we tried. But like that's really dry dirt. It's hard to dig. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=160.64s)]
*  Theoretically, you could. Dig a hole to China? Yeah, under the Pacific. Yes. I mean, Elon Musk [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  was working on it right now. He did. It's a boring company. That's right. It's such a boring company, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=171.92s)]
*  though. You never hear anything cool they do. Dana, South Carolina is going to see a lot of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=175.92s)]
*  Democrats now. Yeah. How's Gavin doing that? So he reminded me of something. Do you remember who was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  first out of the gate in 2020 and 2019? Who was first out of the gate for Democrats? Anybody? Even [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=187.36s)]
*  Harold? I don't remember. In 2019, the first person out of the gate was Kamala. It was Kamala. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=194.8s)]
*  Kamala, I get it. Do I win a prize? Okay. And Kamala was like, oh, she was out there. And remember [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=200.4s)]
*  even President Trump was like, she got a good crowd. And then what happened? By the end of 2019, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=205.36s)]
*  before the voting even happened in 2020, she was out. And it kind of reminds me of this because [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=211.28000000000003s)]
*  it's a little early and he doesn't have big crowds. I know that the Democrats want to have [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=216.72s)]
*  somebody out there to do it, but he's using all the same points and messages that they just lost [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=221.52s)]
*  on in 2024. There is not somebody who is like, I don't like his politics, but like Zoran Mamdani [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=226.72s)]
*  was like, oh, I see Elaine and I can get in there because nobody else is doing it. I said that about [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=233.52s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries. I was like, well, if you're not going to be the one that is leading the party, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=241.36s)]
*  somebody is going to do it. I just don't necessarily think that it is Gavin Newsom. At one [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=245.12s)]
*  point he had some fake tears. There was a little bit of a fake accent, a little southern accent. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I got to see that. And it was just a little too thirsty for me. Well, too thirsty. Harold, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=255.12s)]
*  the kingmaker, Clyburn, he gave us Joe Biden. Thank you for that, James. And is he going to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=259.92s)]
*  give us Gavin Newsom now? I don't know. Step back for one moment. All political parties out [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=267.76s)]
*  of power struggle and the Democrats are out of power and we are in the part of we're in that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=274.72s)]
*  struggling piece right now. When leaders are chosen by political parties during these moments, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=279.6s)]
*  we should never expect it because it never is to be some sort of choreographed ballet. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=285.68s)]
*  It's always a little back and forth. I think about 2013 and 2021. 2013 was Obama's second term, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  first year of it. And if you'd have told Republicans that Donald Trump would be your nominee in 2016, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  people probably would have said there's no way. It was Jeb Bush that was the front runner for a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=304.48s)]
*  long time, at least a proverbial front runner in the eyes and minds of a lot of people in the press [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=308.24s)]
*  and the donors in the party. In 2021, many people thought that Governor DeSantis, Governor Youngkin, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=312.16s)]
*  Governor Haley, others would be the candidate that would emerge in 2024. Donald Trump emerged again. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=318.8s)]
*  He came up with the ideas and agenda. Democrats, if the election were held today, we would lose [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=325.76s)]
*  badly. But we have a couple years here to figure out a message and agenda. I don't fault the guy [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=330.64s)]
*  for going to South Carolina. I'm curious. I'm gonna read up on a little bit more when I leave. What [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  did he say? I think Dana's right. You gotta have, and you were I think touching on it too, Jess, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=339.84s)]
*  you gotta have a purpose and it can't the purpose just can't be Trump sucks. Democrats know that, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=344.08s)]
*  right? In their minds, you've got to come up with ways in which you're going to bring back those [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  disaffected Democrats, union members who voted for him, independents who were appealed, who were [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=353.36s)]
*  found him appealing. And I believe as much as we may have joked a little bit about James Carville, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=358.16s)]
*  he still has the message in my lifetime that makes the most sense when you're running [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=362.88000000000005s)]
*  a successful presidential race. It's the economy, stupid. Get to people's living standards. In our [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  own, one of our home newspapers here in this building, the Wall Street Journal, Jason Riley [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  wrote about how the president's on a great role. But if you don't, if he doesn't, and these policies [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  of his do not improve the living standards of everyday working Americans, he too will have a [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=380.48s)]
*  problem in the short term. That's where Democrats need to be. Rosanna, you have this communist guy [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=385.68s)]
*  causing problems nationally too, threatening Hakeem, and now everybody has to answer for this guy. How [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=390.08s)]
*  big of a problem is he going to be? It's a big problem. First of all, I don't know if you saw the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=395.52s)]
*  latest statistics, Zoran Mandani brought out the largest amount of voters in New York primary [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=400.08s)]
*  history, over 565,000 voters. And then the other issue is that the Democratic Party, look, they have [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=407.2s)]
*  an identity crisis. And Greg, you're being hard on Gavin Newsom. Give him a break. He's at least a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=415.84s)]
*  centrist. We're dealing with Zoran Mandami, who is the working party's, right, socialist arm of the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=421.76s)]
*  Democratic Party. And they're taken over. They're very well organized. They're not going anywhere. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  They have a digital platform. They have a grassroots army. There's strong ties with labor. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=435.12s)]
*  Watch them because I know when I called Andrew Cuomo's campaign and said, what is going on? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=441.92s)]
*  Where is your message? And they told me, and I asked them, I go, what's going on with the Democratic [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  Party? I don't hear anything. All I hear is working families party. Someone in his office said to me, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=453.20000000000005s)]
*  there is no more Democratic Party. It's the socialist party. I can't tell the difference [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  between Zoran and Gavin. Is there an issue that they differentiate on? I'm going to ask Gavin when [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=464.0s)]
*  I interview about the government-run grocery stores. It's definitely not on trance. It's not on taxes. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=469.44s)]
*  It's not on immigration. They're exactly the same. He might not hate the Jews as much. Yes. Right. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=474.88s)]
*  There you go. That's a big one I might add. Next, consequences could be coming for deep state darlings [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=480.32s)]
*  Cuomi and Brennan. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSOfSZMMVY&t=488.0s)]
