**Fox News - The Five:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44)
*  The story isn't that we didn't see it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=0.0s)]
*  It's that you saw it and you denied it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  You knew it was there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=5.76s)]
*  You refused to cover it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=7.2s)]
*  So shut up. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=8.72s)]
*  The Dems are like a used car lot [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=10.48s)]
*  that has a reputation for selling lemons. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=12.64s)]
*  You know, they sold us two big lemons recently, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  you know, Kamala and Biden. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=17.76s)]
*  So what do you do when your reputation is ruined? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=19.52s)]
*  You know, you shut down and reopen under a new name, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=22.0s)]
*  value jet, you know, became Air Trans. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=25.52s)]
*  Lance Armstrong became Livestrong. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=28.24s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=31.76s)]
*  Philip Morris became Altria. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=32.56s)]
*  GMAC became Ally Financial. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=34.4s)]
*  Weight Watchers is now WW. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=38.08s)]
*  So either the Dems gotta come clean [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=40.32s)]
*  or they gotta shut down and find a new name. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=42.64s)]
*  Because the only way, I said this to Howard yesterday, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=46.16s)]
*  the only way for the Dems and the media can regain trust [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  is to turn on the establishment like Trump did [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=54.08s)]
*  and create their own lane. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=56.48s)]
*  One person to only text one candidate [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  because that's the only lane for the survival [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=61.44s)]
*  of the Democrat Party and in a way, Hollywood too. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  You could say Taylor Swift is a huge talent [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=66.8s)]
*  but she has no credibility. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=69.12s)]
*  Bruce Springsteen, no credibility. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  Robert De Niro, no credibility. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=72.88s)]
*  They all lost their credibility. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tt7Sgz-44&t=74.24s)]
