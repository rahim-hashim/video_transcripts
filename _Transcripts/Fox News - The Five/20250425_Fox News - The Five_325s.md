# Bream rips liberals comparing Trump to Hitler, citing those who really suffered
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI)
*  Liberal comedian Bill Maher is hitting back against Larry David's outrageous [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=0.0s)]
*  op-ed in the New York Times this week. It linked Maher's dinner with the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=3.92s)]
*  president to dining with Adolf Hitler. Check this out. To use the Hitler thing, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=7.72s)]
*  first of all I just think it's kind of insulting to six million dead Jews, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=14.0s)]
*  you know, like that should kind of be in its own place in history. Hitler has [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=20.28s)]
*  really kind of got to stay in his own place. He is the goat of evil and we're [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=27.04s)]
*  just gonna have to, I think, leave it like that. Such a radical statement that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=32.28s)]
*  say that, you know, people aren't equivalent to Hitler. Shannon, I feel like [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=37.64s)]
*  the real outrage here is that it's an intellectual dishonesty when they link [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=41.32s)]
*  Trump to Hitler because if Trump is using the executive powers to enact his [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=44.28s)]
*  will in our government, that's more like Obama, right? I mean, than Hitler. I mean, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=48.8s)]
*  I'm just saying they like him a lot. Yeah, they like the pen and when it's used, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=53.48s)]
*  depending on the president, using it. But you mentioned executive power. This is a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=57.64s)]
*  president right now who was getting blowback for using executive orders to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  try to shut down anti-Semitism on college campuses. So I find it rich that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=64.84s)]
*  there would be this constant equation of him with Nazism or with Hitler. I think [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=70.24s)]
*  it's lazy. I think it's offensive to people who actually suffered at the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=74.24s)]
*  hands of Hitler and it kind of just signals that you don't have an argument [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=77.6s)]
*  that's where you go. But this is a man who is trying to take action against [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=81.32s)]
*  anti-Semitism. He has a daughter and grandchildren who are Jewish as well. He [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  had the Abraham Accords. This is a man that is well loved in Israel and they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=88.8s)]
*  feel like he's actually fought on their behalf. Rosanna, you know, they just go [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  straight to Hitler with this comparison and I didn't read the Larry David op-ed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  because I'm not gonna pay the New York Times for their paywall. But I mean, is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  this more of a joke? Like, do we have to defend comedy even when it's offensive? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=104.72s)]
*  Or is this just a part of that trope that they use that Trump is literally [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=109.2s)]
*  Hitler? I have to say I just kept thinking Larry David and Bill Maher are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=112.4s)]
*  supposed to be friends. Yeah. Larry David didn't feel like it was necessary to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=116.4s)]
*  pick up the phone to his friend and say, hey, why'd you do that? Instead, he writes [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=120.36s)]
*  this op-ed that the deputy opinion editor felt needed a message from him to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  kind of explain what Larry David wrote. You know, it just goes back to when you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=131.16s)]
*  go and start calling somebody a Hitler lover, okay? You don't want to have a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=136.72s)]
*  conversation with them. You want to silence them. You want to end that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=141.44s)]
*  argument right there. And it just kind of reminds me of what's been going on the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=145.92s)]
*  last few months. You watch, if you watch former MSNBC host Joy Reid, she [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=150.44s)]
*  encouraged her viewers... Nobody did. That's why it's former. Anyway, I'm sorry, go ahead. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=158.32s)]
*  She encouraged her viewers not to have dinner with their family for Thanksgiving [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=163.6s)]
*  if they voted for Trump, okay? She wasn't the only one who did that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=169.28s)]
*  Sonny Hosted, from The View, she also told people, you know, distance yourself from [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=174.0s)]
*  your family. What's going on with our world that we're encouraging this and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=180.4s)]
*  instead of inviting people to get back around the table and discuss things? I [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=185.88s)]
*  remember, you know, in my family growing up, we had this kind of discourse, but now [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=191.44s)]
*  we want to shame people. We want to silence them. That's interesting. It's like they've [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=196.8s)]
*  dehumanized conservatives, almost like the Nazis dehumanized Jews. But we [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=199.84s)]
*  won't make those comparisons around here. Greg, I got a good one for you. Greg, I [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=204.32s)]
*  think Bill Maher absolutely got the last laugh because in that Piers Morgan [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=208.96s)]
*  interview, he said very nonchalantly, if I can talk to Trump, I can talk to Larry [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=212.64s)]
*  David too. He made an actual comparison and said, you're just as bad as anyone. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=216.72s)]
*  You're throwing stuff at them. I mean, Maher's making a very important point that has to be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=221.24s)]
*  made, given the fact that so many people have been doing this for the past eight [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=227.16s)]
*  years. This is not a news story. Larry David is neither original in this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=230.12s)]
*  comparison or brave in this comparison. This is kind of a cowardly, lazy move on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=235.32000000000002s)]
*  his part. Hitler is a mass murderer. He's not just someone who reminds you of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=240.28s)]
*  somebody you don't like, you know? What you're actually doing is you're [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=246.24s)]
*  lessening the the magnitude of the horrors of the Holocaust. And Maher makes [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=250.04s)]
*  that pretty clear. The problem here is that I couldn't find any instance where [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  Larry David took a stand where it counted. Like, did he defend Jerry [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=262.32s)]
*  Seinfeld when he was targeted by pro-Hamas activists? I couldn't find that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=267.24s)]
*  Did he pen an op-ed about the acts of intimidation and aggression by Jew [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  haters on all these college campuses? I didn't see any of that. Did he confront [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=276.64s)]
*  pro-Hamas creeps who tore down the posters of Jewish hostages in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  New York? I mean, he could have done that and it probably happened in California. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  Did he say anything at all about the remaining hostages? I haven't heard [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=288.0s)]
*  anything. I did a search. I didn't find anything. But he does this. This is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=292.68s)]
*  the place that he chooses to be brave. That's why I find it kind of stupid and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=300.0s)]
*  silly and sad. You know, and by the way, Trump has done way more for Jews than [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=306.12s)]
*  Larry David has, so that makes Larry David worse than Hitler. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99KD87nmSI&t=311.96s)]
