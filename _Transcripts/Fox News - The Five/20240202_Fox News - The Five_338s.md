# Ex-CIA station chief: These proxy groups wouldn't exist without Iran
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU)
*  station chief Dan Hoffman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=0.0s)]
*  He's also a Fox News contributor. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=1.46s)]
*  And I'm curious what you think about that leak from last night [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=2.82s)]
*  that came out from the administration suggesting [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=5.66s)]
*  that Iran really had nothing, no idea that this was going on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=8.3s)]
*  And it was almost as if they were trying to give Iran cover [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=11.78s)]
*  that they didn't know that they allowed, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=15.26s)]
*  as I said on Martha's show, they let the kids have a kegger [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=17.26s)]
*  and then pretended to know nothing about it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's a distinction without a difference [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=24.7s)]
*  because none of those proxy terrorist groups would exist [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=27.16s)]
*  without Iran's support. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=31.44s)]
*  Iran provides them with military equipment, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=32.8s)]
*  with all the missiles that they need, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=35.28s)]
*  with intelligence support, with financial support. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=36.96s)]
*  And so Iran might not have told them when to strike, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=40.82s)]
*  but Iran was certainly providing them [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=44.72s)]
*  with all of that support [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  because those groups intended to strike us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=49.44s)]
*  And let's just be clear, we are at war with Iran. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  It's a proxy war right now, but there is a war going on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  And it's happening because the Houthis, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=59.52s)]
*  Lebanese Hezbollah is targeting Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  And remember that this all started 40 years ago [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  when Hezbollah, the predecessor terrorist group to Hezbollah, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=66.28s)]
*  launched an attack on the Marine barracks [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=70.08s)]
*  and then our embassy in Beirut. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=72.4s)]
*  That's the way Iran operates. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=73.86s)]
*  That's the way they conduct war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=75.28s)]
*  All right, anybody got a question for Dan Hoffman? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=77.6s)]
*  Dan, I'll follow up on what we talked about earlier. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=80.36s)]
*  We talked about all these guys scattered around [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  and all these bases in Syria and Iraq [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=83.86s)]
*  that are the target of these attacks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=85.78s)]
*  What are they accomplishing, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=87.22s)]
*  having a presence in Syria and Iraq? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=88.22s)]
*  Well, look, we've got a couple of interests, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  important national security interests in the Middle East. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=94.14s)]
*  One is freedom of navigation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=96.18s)]
*  There's a lot of trade that happens through the Red Sea. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  And then in Syria and Iraq, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  very small numbers of US troops, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  2,500 in Iraq, just a few hundred in Syria. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=104.58000000000001s)]
*  They're there to do counter-terrorism operations. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=107.36s)]
*  They're not there to bring democracy to the Middle East. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  They're not there to build girls' schools, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  but they are there to protect us here at home [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=114.24s)]
*  because there are terrorists, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=115.72s)]
*  al-Qaeda and ISIS terrorists there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=117.44s)]
*  And if we don't target them way out there, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=119.52s)]
*  left of boom, then they're going to target us in the region [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=122.08s)]
*  and potentially here at home. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=125.82s)]
*  Look, I served in those places. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=127.56s)]
*  I served in Iraq for a year. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=128.92s)]
*  I served in South Asia as a station chief for two years. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=130.14s)]
*  We were always perfectly fine serving in harm's way [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=133.36s)]
*  as long as we had the right equipment [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=136.28s)]
*  to keep us as safe as possible, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=139.96s)]
*  as well as the right policy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  And that's what has been lacking [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  over the past certainly few months [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  where 160 plus strikes against our people [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=148.24s)]
*  and we've lost escalation dominance to Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=151.44s)]
*  Dan, Janine Pirro here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  The whole idea of our policy of allowing how many, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=159.44s)]
*  I think it's like 80 or 100 who were injured, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=164.8s)]
*  some with traumatic brain injuries in Iraq and Syria [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=167.84s)]
*  before this last attack where three were killed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  and 40 injured. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=173.78s)]
*  How much influence has the commercial interference [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  of shipping had on the American policy? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=180.10000000000002s)]
*  I mean, cause it's almost like you see the commercial, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=183.74s)]
*  Maersk apparently is not going through the Red Sea. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  Now they're going around the Cape of Africa. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=190.10000000000002s)]
*  I mean, do you see policy changing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=192.38s)]
*  when it comes to commercial vessels [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=195.58s)]
*  and countries getting a little more aggressive then [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=197.86s)]
*  as opposed to when Americans are injured? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=200.28s)]
*  Cause I'm not convinced this administration [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=202.44s)]
*  is so concerned about Americans [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=204.48s)]
*  when we allowed 160 attacks on our servicemen [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  in Syria and Iraq. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=210.44s)]
*  Well, I'm sure the administration [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=213.42s)]
*  and I'm sure that those who are serving [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=215.0s)]
*  in the administration are very concerned [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  about US servicemen and women [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=219.68s)]
*  and others who are serving in harm's way. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  I think they're also concerned, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=224.18s)]
*  overriding concern for them is not to escalate [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  and result in a war with Iran. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=230.3s)]
*  And I think that they've overplayed that by a lot. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=232.02s)]
*  For sure there's interest in freedom of navigation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=235.22s)]
*  You're absolutely 100% right about that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=237.34s)]
*  The world economy will suffer greatly [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  because of these Houthi terrorists. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  And one more thing that I would add [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  is if you don't strike back early, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  then the price of deterrence just goes up. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=248.22000000000003s)]
*  And so the price of deterring the Houthis [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=250.62s)]
*  has gone way up over the past couple of months, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=252.66000000000003s)]
*  as well as dealing with those Iranian proxy terrorists [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=255.3s)]
*  in Syria and in Iraq who are targeting us there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=259.3s)]
*  We have to pay a much greater price today. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=263.0s)]
*  Dan, the $10 billion waiver [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  that the Biden administration gave to Iran [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=266.8s)]
*  is still in effect tonight. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=268.68s)]
*  Yeah, and we know where the money goes, Dana. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  It's straight to Iran's ballistic missile program. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=274.72s)]
*  It's their nuclear program and it's the proxy terrorists. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=277.8s)]
*  So it's gotta be an all of government approach here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=280.56s)]
*  The DOJ seizing of $500,000 worth of Iranian oil [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=284.48s)]
*  is a good first, albeit small step, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=289.38000000000005s)]
*  but there's gotta be a lot more. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=292.66s)]
*  They've gotta cut off Iran's access to funds [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  because we know what they're doing with it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=297.42s)]
*  Unfortunately, Russia and China, as well as North Korea and Iran, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=299.3s)]
*  make up this century's axis of tyranny. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=304.06s)]
*  That's been one of the results of the war in Gaza [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=306.3s)]
*  and Russia's brutal, barbaric war in Ukraine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=309.1s)]
*  And that's just another wickedly complex challenge [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=312.18s)]
*  for this administration. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  Dan, thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=316.24s)]
*  It's also another reason why I brought up... [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqeCHkrteOU&t=317.34s)]
