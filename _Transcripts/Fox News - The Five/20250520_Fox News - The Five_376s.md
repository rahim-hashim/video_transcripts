# 'The Five' break down Dems being called out after ICE clash
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM)
*  Oh, give me a break. Did you see her? She was out of control. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=0.0s)]
*  Did you address her? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=3.0s)]
*  You know, those days are over. The days of woe. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=4.0s)]
*  The days of woe. No, I didn't. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=6.0s)]
*  The days of woe are over. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=8.0s)]
*  That woman, I have no idea who she is. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=10.0s)]
*  That woman was out of control. She was shoving federal agents. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=13.0s)]
*  She was out of control. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=16.0s)]
*  The days of that crap are over in this country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=18.0s)]
*  We're going to have law and order. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=20.0s)]
*  President Trump going off on New Jersey Democratic Congresswoman [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=22.0s)]
*  LaMonica McIver after she was charged with assaulting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=25.0s)]
*  two officers over that now infamous ICE clash at the Newark facility. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=28.0s)]
*  Now, Congresswoman McIver is adamant that she did nothing wrong [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=33.0s)]
*  and says ICE is at fault for her allegedly assaulting them. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=37.0s)]
*  The entire situation was escalated by ICE. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=42.0s)]
*  They caused the confrontation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=46.0s)]
*  Homeland came and caused this chaos that we see. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=48.0s)]
*  It was a very tense situation, but it could have been, you know, easily, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=52.0s)]
*  it could have easily not happened. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=56.0s)]
*  They had every opportunity to not allow this to happen. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=58.0s)]
*  It was very unnecessary. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=61.0s)]
*  And it just, once again, we were there to do our jobs. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=63.0s)]
*  And, you know, if I'm going to be charged with a crime for doing my job, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=66.0s)]
*  it just speaks to, you know, where we're headed in this country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=70.0s)]
*  It's political intimidation, and I'm looking forward to my day in court. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=73.0s)]
*  All eyes are now on minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=77.0s)]
*  who said that the arrest of any Democratic lawmakers would be his red line. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=80.0s)]
*  Swalwell now promising that there will be more confrontations with ICE. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=84.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=89.0s)]
*  It's complete political theater, and I promise you, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=90.0s)]
*  there's going to be more unnoticed visits for my colleagues, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=92.0s)]
*  where they show up and they better be let in. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=98.0s)]
*  You said that this was a red line. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=101.0s)]
*  What happened now that it's been crossed? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=103.0s)]
*  I address that in a statement. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=105.0s)]
*  This is a baseless, politically motivated distraction. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=106.0s)]
*  This is typical of the Justice Department, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=109.0s)]
*  trying to intimidate anybody who might oppose them, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=112.0s)]
*  whether they be an elected official, a judge, or anybody else. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=115.0s)]
*  So, Kennedy, this facility in New Jersey has been used since 2000 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=118.0s)]
*  for different detainees, federal detainees who were also in here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=124.0s)]
*  It was then closed for a few years, and then it was reopened. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=128.0s)]
*  I don't remember any of these people showing up to protest the detainment of people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=131.0s)]
*  or to talk about whether or not it was a safe facility [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=135.0s)]
*  under the Biden administration or under previous administrations. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=138.0s)]
*  So, what is it they're so incensed about now? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=141.0s)]
*  They have gotten addicted to protests. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=143.0s)]
*  They have gotten addicted to drama. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=146.0s)]
*  We all know that discussions like this that are so incredibly heated [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=148.0s)]
*  require adults who are going to employ some moderation, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=153.0s)]
*  but LaMonica McIver knows that her name is not going to be mentioned anywhere [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=157.0s)]
*  if she sits down and has a conversation with Christy Noem or Tom Homan in her office. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=161.0s)]
*  And, you know, if you look at this in the body cam footage, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=167.0s)]
*  and there was a lot of video evidence here, it's very inconvenient for her [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=171.0s)]
*  because she is clearly not de-escalating the situation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=176.0s)]
*  And for these federal officers who have been trained to de-escalate, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=180.0s)]
*  they've also been trained to read body language, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=185.0s)]
*  and they know the intent of someone when they raise their forearm and elbows. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=187.0s)]
*  All you have to do is listen to Ludacris' Southern Hospitality to know [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=192.0s)]
*  that when someone does this, they're about to drop bows on them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=195.0s)]
*  And that's a scary place to be if you're a federal officer [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=197.0s)]
*  because you don't want to have to respond with force, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=200.0s)]
*  but they have to move the conversation to this most dramatic point [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=204.0s)]
*  in order to get the one thing they crave so much, which actually fuels them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=208.0s)]
*  It's as though they've got solar panels on themselves. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=213.0s)]
*  They need attention. They need chaos. They need drama. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=216.0s)]
*  And none of that is helpful. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=221.0s)]
*  None of that moves the conversation forward politically, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=222.0s)]
*  and if they're really doing what they're supposed to be doing, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=224.0s)]
*  then write laws in Congress, create a coalition, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=227.0s)]
*  and pass them if ICE needs to be reformed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=231.0s)]
*  You know, they showed up, Jessica, for several days. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=234.0s)]
*  Mayor Barraco showed up for several days. He's running for governor. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=237.0s)]
*  It does appear that they wanted exactly the attention that they ended up getting. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=240.0s)]
*  He was arrested. That charge was... He was not charged. She was charged. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=245.0s)]
*  What outcome are they actually trying to produce here? It's unclear. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=250.0s)]
*  Well, they're trying to, at least in the case of the congresspeople, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=255.0s)]
*  and there were three of them that went down there, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=258.0s)]
*  they're trying to exercise their right to conduct oversight, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=260.0s)]
*  and they're arguing that they were being prevented. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=263.0s)]
*  But they got in. They got in. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=265.0s)]
*  Eventually, but there's no question... [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=266.0s)]
*  They said it was fine in there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=268.0s)]
*  The scuffle outside appears to be quite messy on both sides of it, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=270.0s)]
*  and I'm not saying that Congresswoman McIver is not really pushing her way in, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=273.0s)]
*  and there are eyewitnesses there who say that it was ICE agents [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=277.0s)]
*  who initiated the physical contact. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=280.0s)]
*  They had seen the mayor of Newark being taken away, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=282.0s)]
*  and Alina Haba, the interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=285.0s)]
*  has now dropped the charges against him in the hopes of being able to move forward. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=290.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way that the government is indicating [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=295.0s)]
*  that they know that they have been overplaying their hand on this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=297.0s)]
*  and that public opinion is shifting against ICE and what the DHS is doing here. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=300.0s)]
*  So we will see what happens with Congresswoman McIver, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=305.0s)]
*  but I know that she was trying to get in there to see what's actually going on at this point, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=308.0s)]
*  and you say, well, they weren't doing this under the Biden administration. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=312.0s)]
*  There weren't people with green cards being picked up off the street [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=314.0s)]
*  and held in detention facilities under the Biden administration. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=318.0s)]
*  We weren't sending people to see-cut... [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=321.0s)]
*  These people have deportation orders, orders to detain most of them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=323.0s)]
*  A lot of them are gang members. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=325.0s)]
*  Most of them, but that's the thing. We are finding out... [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=326.0s)]
*  But that's the thing. On an almost daily basis, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=328.0s)]
*  we are finding out that there are people who are being detained unlawfully, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=330.0s)]
*  that they should not be in there, that they are innocent if they came here illegally, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=333.0s)]
*  that they actually went through the asylum system, that they were due their day in court, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=336.0s)]
*  and now they're in a detention facility here or they've been sent to El Salvador. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=339.0s)]
*  And you can understand why people are skeptical of this [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=343.0s)]
*  and why people are honestly pushing back on certainly this aspect [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=346.0s)]
*  of Donald Trump's immigration policy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=349.0s)]
*  And you hear Kristi Noem today in front of the Senate, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=351.0s)]
*  who can't define what habeas corpus is, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=354.0s)]
*  is being pushed and pushed and pushed about what they're doing, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=357.0s)]
*  and the American public is not standing for it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVr7Ci1F7xM&t=361.0s)]
