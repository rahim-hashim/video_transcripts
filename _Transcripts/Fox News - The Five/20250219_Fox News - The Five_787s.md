# Judge Jeanine praises Trump-Musk interview as ‘refreshing’
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE)
*  At any moment, President Trump will be addressing a tech investment summit in Miami Beach, Florida, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=0.0s)]
*  and we will bring that to you live once it happens. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=5.72s)]
*  But in the meantime, it was the Trump and Musk show on Hannity last night. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=7.96s)]
*  The unlikely duo discussing a wide range of topics, with the president singing high praises [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  for Doge while tipping his hat to its head of tech support. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  There's a hundred geniuses. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=21.72s)]
*  He's got some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=23.96s)]
*  him, actually. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=28.96s)]
*  Just t-shirts. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=30.0s)]
*  You wouldn't know they have 180. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=31.0s)]
*  So he's your tech support. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=33.0s)]
*  No, no, he is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=35.84s)]
*  But he's much more than that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=36.84s)]
*  I literally am tech support, though. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=37.84s)]
*  But he gets it done. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=38.84s)]
*  He's a leader. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=39.84s)]
*  He really is. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=40.84s)]
*  He gets it done. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=41.84s)]
*  Musk sharing why his fight to cut government bloat is so critical to the MAGA mission. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=43.72s)]
*  The bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing the president from implementing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  what the people want, then what we live in is a bureaucracy and not a democracy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=55.96s)]
*  In order to save taxpayer money, it comes down to two things, competence and caring. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=60.4s)]
*  Later, the pair teamed up for a dual take down of the Democrats' hysterical response [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=66.2s)]
*  to the Doge cuts. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=71.12s)]
*  It's funny how often when these attacks occur, the thing that they're accusing the administration [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=73.64s)]
*  of is what they are guilty of. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=79.54s)]
*  They're saying that things are being done unconstitutional, but what they are doing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=81.52s)]
*  is unconstitutional. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=85.88s)]
*  They are guilty of the crime of which they accuse us. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=88.5s)]
*  That's always the first thing they do. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  He's in violation of the Constitution. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=92.56s)]
*  They don't even know what they're talking about. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=94.36s)]
*  Well, they know. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=95.88s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=96.88s)]
*  It's just a con job. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=97.88s)]
*  It's a big con job. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=98.88s)]
*  And they're so bad for the country, so dangerous and so bad, and the media is so bad. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=99.88s)]
*  When I watch MSNBC, which I don't watch much, but you have to watch The Enemy on occasion, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=103.64s)]
*  the level of arrogance and cheating and they're just horrible people. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=110.06s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld, it's your day. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  A day in the life of you on the cover of Variety magazine. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=123.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=124.42s)]
*  It beats being on the cover of Playgirl, but. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=125.42s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe next year. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I'm working on that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=128.74s)]
*  When Musk was saying that the Democrats do what they accuse Doge of doing, I was reminded [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=130.74s)]
*  of when Biden knew he couldn't actually pass constitutional muster by forgiving student [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=136.74s)]
*  loans, but they did it anyway. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=142.58s)]
*  And then the court kept striking them down. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=144.18s)]
*  In this case, the strikes, the judges so far have upheld President Trump's role. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=147.06s)]
*  It's been, I think, it's been the last four years of nothing but projection. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=153.9s)]
*  Almost everything that they accuse Trump of doing, they're either planning on doing or [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=158.18s)]
*  have already done. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=163.26000000000002s)]
*  We could go through those. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=165.06s)]
*  Also, the projection is found in their accusation that Doge isn't being transparent, not transparent [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=167.1s)]
*  enough. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=173.66s)]
*  Are you out of your mind? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=174.66s)]
*  This is a criticism that they never lodged against the government. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=175.66s)]
*  Like how are they spending your money? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=179.61999999999998s)]
*  Like that should be transparent. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=181.54s)]
*  I'm actually, I have to say, I'm exhausted by the transparency. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  I feel like I'm falling behind in everything that I hear. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=186.94s)]
*  Every day I wake up, there's a new Doge thing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  It's like I have enough problems. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=192.89999999999998s)]
*  It's like getting a load of morning emails from Dana and you go, I've got to read this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=195.7s)]
*  She's telling me I have to read that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=200.02s)]
*  Also, if the dead are so certain that Trump's policies won't work, why not just sit back [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=202.1s)]
*  and let them fail? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=208.78s)]
*  Their panic is telling you that they fear or they know that he's going to succeed and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=210.3s)]
*  that's going to prove him wrong. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=216.26s)]
*  I also just want to come on that relationship between the two. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=217.5s)]
*  They are like, they're like, not Batman and Robin. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=221.5s)]
*  Jesse and Johnny. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=227.34s)]
*  No, no, no, because this is like an equal footing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=228.54s)]
*  Maybe it's the green hornet and Kato, but they finish each other's thoughts. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=231.62s)]
*  And also, this goes back to like the idea about age, that Trump may be closing in on [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=236.14s)]
*  80, but when it comes to technology, he's right up there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  He understands AI. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=245.5s)]
*  He can hang with these tech bros and it's pretty seamless. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=247.3s)]
*  This is not like the Joe Biden 80 or 79 we saw. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=253.58s)]
*  Last, the Democrats have a problem with this story because if a doctor tells you that they [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=257.74s)]
*  need to remove a polyp from your colon, but they need to put a camera up there and you're [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=264.02s)]
*  like, no, no, you're not putting a camera up there. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=269.74s)]
*  It's like, well, are you hiding something in your butt? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=272.74s)]
*  You know, it's like that's it's going to save your life. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=275.74s)]
*  And that's all Doge is is basically a bureaucratic colonoscopy, which is necessary. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=278.3s)]
*  And I think this is also why we needed an outsider. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=284.5s)]
*  We've had oversight committees and we've had inspectors, generals and still billions went [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=286.94s)]
*  missing. So it's good to have an outsider come in. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=292.1s)]
*  That's why they bring in outside consultants to audit Jesse so that we've put a camera up [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=295.42s)]
*  the bureau of the government. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=300.42s)]
*  But hey, Judge. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=302.18s)]
*  Elon Musk said that the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=305.29999999999995s)]
*  And I think that they are seeing in some of their polling, even the Democrats are starting [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=310.5s)]
*  to say, oh, wait, this is actually popular. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=314.26s)]
*  Yeah, it is it is belied by the polling. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  You're absolutely right. I mean, it's not just a president who won the popular vote [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  in the swing states and all that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=324.53999999999996s)]
*  This is something that is continuously being favored in the polls by the American people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=326.62s)]
*  But you know what I thought was so amazing about the interview? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=331.5s)]
*  And and yes, Greg, I have gotten those those emails from Dana and I do read them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=333.73999999999995s)]
*  I read them in the morning. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=339.38s)]
*  But you know, you know how you hear about celebrities and they say the marriage is in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=340.97999999999996s)]
*  trouble. So you look at the two of them and Greg, you're right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  They finished each other's sentences and thoughts. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=349.26s)]
*  I mean, they were having fun. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=351.82s)]
*  They interacted with each other. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=353.82s)]
*  They respected each other. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=355.9s)]
*  It was a it was how they spoke. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it was absolutely they're happy doing what they're doing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=360.18s)]
*  And I was so impressed with that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=364.06s)]
*  And I was also impressed with the fact that, you know, the president and they told us the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=366.02s)]
*  first term, it's his ego. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=369.9s)]
*  He's always it's always about him. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=371.7s)]
*  No, it isn't. He brought this guy into the Oval. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=373.62s)]
*  He let him bring his son into the Oval X and he's doing an interview with him. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=376.41999999999996s)]
*  And he is recognizing and telling the American people he's so smart. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=381.26s)]
*  I can't find anybody smarter. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=384.58s)]
*  And even as young people are working with him are smart. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=386.34s)]
*  So you've got two businessmen who are you know, you've got the smartest businessman of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=388.98s)]
*  our time with Elon Musk and they're trying to help the American people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=394.5s)]
*  And the president has no problem sharing credit. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=398.26s)]
*  And I like the idea that Elon had of possibly if they reached two trillion, I think it, you [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=401.3s)]
*  know, rebate checks to the American people and the amount of five thousand dollars. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=405.98s)]
*  I mean, they're just thinking out loud and it's refreshing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=409.78000000000003s)]
*  OK, Harold, what did you think of this interview? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=412.82s)]
*  I thought it was I thought it was good. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  Good to be with everybody. I thought it was good. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=417.18s)]
*  I will say fifty five billion dollars is not a lot of money in the scheme of things when you look at government. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=418.74s)]
*  It's less than point two percent of our federal fifty five million more than Joe Biden returned. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=424.86s)]
*  You finished? Fifty five billion dollars. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=431.5s)]
*  So I'm for that. I am for rooting out the waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=433.78s)]
*  But in the real world, I just wouldn't take a victory lap this early. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=438.02s)]
*  I think if you're going to I'm looking I was looking for Mr. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=442.3s)]
*  Mr. Musk to not only identify areas that where there waste, fraud and abuse, but give me areas where we can be more efficient. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=445.62s)]
*  Democrats, if you want to counter this show it, show those areas and show what you're going to use the money for once you're able to produce these savings and secure these savings and increase this efficiency, which we all want to do. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  I think President Trump, the interview was a great interview. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=466.41999999999996s)]
*  Sean did a great job. This is not this is not showering anything bad on Sean at all or even them. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=468.5s)]
*  But I wouldn't take a victory lap for 60 billion dollars. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=473.86s)]
*  I think the country is looking for this president to find ways to cut taxes on their tips, to make sure there are no taxes on people's overtime. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=477.46s)]
*  I think you would even find more Democrats supporting this if they said this is what we're going to use the money for. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=485.14s)]
*  We're going to use the money for things to help talk about a rebate check. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=490.82s)]
*  They don't need to reach two trillion. But the whole idea is to reduce the size of government so that all of us can benefit. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=493.1s)]
*  But you and I both worked together. Fifty five billion dollars. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=498.1s)]
*  I know. Let's let's not kid ourselves. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, again, I wouldn't take a victory lap. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=502.38s)]
*  How much money would you need to save in order to take a victory lap, Jesse? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=503.98s)]
*  I take victory laps when I brush my teeth, Dana. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=510.02000000000004s)]
*  It's all about lapping the field every day. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  Harold, first of all, fifty five billion dollars is a lot of money. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=515.42s)]
*  OK, and they haven't even upgraded the software yet. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=520.34s)]
*  The software is from the 60s. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=523.66s)]
*  That's right. Once they upgrade the software, you'll streamline it and you'll save money. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=525.3000000000001s)]
*  Let me tell you a story about Chris. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=529.42s)]
*  Chris was a guy I met at a shooting event in New Jersey last year. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=531.02s)]
*  Is Chris in the interview? This is another guy. This is Chris. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=534.78s)]
*  Is it a male or female? Let me finish. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=537.0999999999999s)]
*  Fifty five billion. I love you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  And so he was a 20 year veteran of the U.S. military. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=543.3399999999999s)]
*  He was one of these guys in one of these elite units, killed a lot of bad guys, put his life on the line. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=547.18s)]
*  And now he punched out after 20 years and working for the police. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  And working for the Pentagon. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=558.18s)]
*  And he's only been there a few months, so he's probationary. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=560.8199999999999s)]
*  And he just found out he's probably going to get laid off. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=565.2199999999999s)]
*  He's going to get dozed. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=567.5799999999999s)]
*  And he texted me and he said, Jesse, you know, this isn't good. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=569.14s)]
*  I'm upset. This is really sad. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=571.8199999999999s)]
*  And this guy's not a DEI consultant. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=575.02s)]
*  This guy's not a climate consultant. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=577.2199999999999s)]
*  This guy is a veteran. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=580.3s)]
*  So when you're talking about dozing people, veterans should get priority. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=582.54s)]
*  Because if you're going to go out there and kill enemies and put your life on the line for this country, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=588.18s)]
*  you shouldn't be in the same category as people that are doing DEI. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=592.9799999999999s)]
*  Now, Harold and his ilk like to talk about the slash and burn corporate ethos. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=598.2199999999999s)]
*  We just need to be a little bit less callous with the way, Harold. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=605.2199999999999s)]
*  We talk about dozing people. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=609.18s)]
*  OK, I just want to I want that to sink in. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=611.3s)]
*  You're arguing with yourself. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=613.3s)]
*  I am not guilty of that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=615.26s)]
*  I finally found one person I knew that got dozed and it hit me in the heart. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=618.9799999999999s)]
*  But you talk about big ticket items, right? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=623.18s)]
*  Right. Let's talk about those. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=625.18s)]
*  The Pentagon, you have a weapons program in some influential congressman's district. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=627.0999999999999s)]
*  It's a boondoggle. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=633.14s)]
*  It's show no promise in a theater of war. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=634.3s)]
*  You cut that and that's big savings. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=637.02s)]
*  So besides saving my friend, Chris, we want bigger dividend doze check rebates. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=640.18s)]
*  I don't want to pay down the debt. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=646.42s)]
*  Put it back into the economy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=648.26s)]
*  This is an electoral win. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=650.0999999999999s)]
*  The more doze cuts, the bigger the dividend checks. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=652.3s)]
*  We remember how popular the stimulus checks were. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=656.9399999999999s)]
*  We don't want that. We're printing money. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=659.78s)]
*  But you just said these are rebates. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=661.86s)]
*  No, we don't want rebates. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=664.74s)]
*  Doze isn't Robin Hood. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  I want rebates. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=668.2199999999999s)]
*  No voters want. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=669.9399999999999s)]
*  No, but you don't. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=671.14s)]
*  Government is not a piggy bank. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=672.66s)]
*  The whole point of doze is to cut waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=676.9799999999999s)]
*  It's not, hey, let's take, we want to shrink government. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=680.38s)]
*  You're not shrinking government. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=682.6999999999999s)]
*  You're giving money back to the taxpayer. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=683.74s)]
*  If you paid money for $2 million. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=686.42s)]
*  If you paid $2 million for a sex change surgery [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=689.38s)]
*  and you say that no longer is going to be in the budget, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=692.9399999999999s)]
*  I want that money back. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=695.66s)]
*  That's different than what you're actually saying. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=697.3s)]
*  That's exactly what I just said. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=699.18s)]
*  Let's say it's a class action suit. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=700.98s)]
*  You want to get the money back from the government [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=702.34s)]
*  because they took your money and spent on it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=704.94s)]
*  Fine, but that's after you cut this government down [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=706.3800000000001s)]
*  by at least one to two trillion a year [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=709.58s)]
*  to get to that point where you don't have seven times [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=711.46s)]
*  what you're taking in in 10 years. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=713.86s)]
*  Okay, you're making it more complicated. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=714.7s)]
*  No. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=716.34s)]
*  We're cutting spending [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=717.1800000000001s)]
*  and we're giving it back to the taxpayers. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=718.86s)]
*  Then the government doesn't shrink. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=721.0200000000001s)]
*  Then what you should do is cut spending [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=722.34s)]
*  and then lower the tax rates. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=724.46s)]
*  That's exactly what the government does. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=726.1800000000001s)]
*  Jesse's saying, I'm disappointed. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=728.22s)]
*  I agree with Jesse that he has this point. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=729.9399999999999s)]
*  But understand, I want to pay down the debt. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=732.5799999999999s)]
*  At some point we're going to find this picture. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  You're saying, I respect what you're saying. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=737.02s)]
*  I don't agree with you, but I respect you. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=739.02s)]
*  I want to pay down the debt. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=740.78s)]
*  Okay, we can pay down the debt [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=742.42s)]
*  when we grow the economy from higher revenues [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=744.3s)]
*  that the rebate checks are going to generate. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=747.5799999999999s)]
*  That's what tax cuts do. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=749.98s)]
*  That's exactly what tax cuts do. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=751.42s)]
*  I thought you just argued about too much money [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=752.26s)]
*  chasing too few goods, which caused more inflation. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=755.9s)]
*  You're printing money to cause inflation. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=758.02s)]
*  Not here, you're printing nothing. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=760.5s)]
*  Wait till you hear this off camera. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=763.3000000000001s)]
*  Hey, maybe one of us will record it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=766.82s)]
*  Just kidding, we do not do that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=769.4200000000001s)]
*  Coming up, Stephen A. Smith isn't pulling any punches [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=771.9s)]
*  with the Dems telling them that they quote, suck. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ndnmlISAE&t=774.1s)]
