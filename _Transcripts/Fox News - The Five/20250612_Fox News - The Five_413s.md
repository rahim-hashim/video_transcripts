# ‘The Five’: Anti-ICE riots have Dems in disbelief
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0)
*  Jesse I want to start with you. So I think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=0.0s)]
*  The world of deep-face cheap fix I want all of that stuff to be accurate [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=4.74s)]
*  But I do struggle with the way that the right is talking about the LA riots and Donald Trump calls January 6th a day of love [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=9.1s)]
*  But you guys did run January 6th video for two years, but it was accurate, okay [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=21.14s)]
*  Run the LA riots for two years hold hearings [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=27.66s)]
*  When it really these riots Jessica because they were a billion dollars in damage [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=31.04s)]
*  That's what the small business administrator just said on Fox [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=35.82s)]
*  If this wasn't a riot why the mayor had to call curfew for the entire area of downtown [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  If this wasn't a riot why the mayor begged all the business community to come help clean it up [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=45.540000000000006s)]
*  If this wasn't a riot, why do we see videos of the Apple Store and T-Mobile getting looted in 7-eleven? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=51.5s)]
*  Why have we seen interviews of small business owners crying because their entire jewelry store was looted [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  If this is what looks like when LA Lakers win the championship [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  They don't celebrate for six days, Jessica [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=71.06s)]
*  This is a six day riot and by the way, January 6 lasted six hours [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=74.7s)]
*  This is going on for six days [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=80.12s)]
*  and why if [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=83.36s)]
*  Trump is provoking it with a National Guard has it spread to Seattle and New York City [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=86.0s)]
*  Because there's no National Guard in Seattle in New York City. So how is he involved with that? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=90.64s)]
*  Riddle me that Jessica. I'm supposed to ask questions in this block, but I do have an answer for that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=95.48s)]
*  But I don't need a bed. Okay, so the footage is real [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=100.28s)]
*  But the White House for instance is posted a video yesterday of cars burning, but they were from Saturday [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=104.16s)]
*  Isn't that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=110.12s)]
*  Manipulate well it is if they're telling people that something is going on that had been the fire had been put out days before [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  Doesn't that make a difference? Well, I think timeliness in that context encompasses the entire duration of the riot [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=117.84s)]
*  So if we were analyzing this like in the course of the crime a crime many crimes, you would include that entire span [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  So the six days duration I hear what you're saying [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=129.38s)]
*  It's not immediate but I don't think it's irrelevant and I still think it's timely [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=131.34s)]
*  I feel like you know all of all of the pundits and all of the lawmakers who say that this isn't violent [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=135.44s)]
*  They haven't seen violence. It is a luxury in my opinion to hold the position that words are violent [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=140.76s)]
*  Like Pelosi has said or that all Trump supporters are domestic terrorists like Maxine Waters has said [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=147.16s)]
*  but not [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=154.2s)]
*  See that with our eyes exactly what that and that is horrifying all of the flames all of the everything and I feel like they [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=156.28s)]
*  Pick and choose what laws are enforced [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=163.3s)]
*  So if I misgender someone in California right that makes me literally a criminal but a recidivist rapist in San Jose [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=165.22000000000003s)]
*  Oh, he's protected because it's sanctuary and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  The secretary Noam said today at the presser [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=175.10000000000002s)]
*  She said Californians have been conditioned that their actions don't have consequences and now they do so whether you're a senator or an illegal [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=177.66000000000003s)]
*  Immigrant or an anarchist getting paid to throw bricks now, you're gonna see consequences [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  Like we just had the woman here in New York City [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=188.9s)]
*  She threw a Molotov cocktail at a law enforcement vehicle [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=190.54s)]
*  There were officers inside she got six years and there's been a smattering of finally accountability for people [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=193.06s)]
*  Torching law enforcement vehicles are getting two and a half three and a half even five and a half years [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  And I just I feel like these are the same Dems to that we classified all of the crimes after kovat [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=202.44s)]
*  They reduced to violent crimes to nonviolent like stalking and now they're like, oh right the label [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=209.0s)]
*  No, no, that's nonviolent because it says here in black and white [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=214.62s)]
*  But they're missing the force for the trees and everyone can see through their lives just by watching the screen [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=217.5s)]
*  I so want to talk about January 6 pardons, but I do need to go to you Greg [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=222.42s)]
*  So I because I live in reality [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=226.5s)]
*  I know that these images are going to come up in elections in 2026 and 2028 and do you think they're gonna hurt Democrats? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=228.06s)]
*  I don't I don't look at this politically. I look at it as a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=235.86s)]
*  societal issue [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  And I don't understand why the Dems continue to always side [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=240.78s)]
*  With the people who want to destroy this this country and they say oh, it's only a four-square block area [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=246.54s)]
*  Well great do that with fire, you know others, you know, there's a four-square block blaze going uncontrolled [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=253.62s)]
*  But you know, it's just four square blocks. It's kind of what they did in LA. Yeah, I love how the Dems say [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=259.62s)]
*  There's no riot, but if there is one it's Trump's fault. That's pretty interesting, too [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=265.1s)]
*  The media lives in an alternate alternate universe and the Dems do too the what-if universe [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=270.5s)]
*  What if Trump didn't send the troops he didn't have to do that. What if it would have been fine? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=277.18s)]
*  No, we have evidence what happens. It's called the George Floyd riots. We know what happens when you don't restore order [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=281.68s)]
*  Lawlessness leads to more lawlessness, you know, we saw it [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=289.86s)]
*  Also, we saw it with the Palisades fire you guys like had a terrible response [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=293.54s)]
*  It got worse and like you said, it's a luxury to say this because Trump prevented more chaos [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=297.14s)]
*  It also amazes me that the media still thinks they matter after telling us not to believe what our ears and eyes told us [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=303.94s)]
*  About Biden they're trying to tell us about deep fakes. These guys fell for the Covington kid [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  They fell for Jussie Smollett. They fell for what the fine people hoax? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=318.5s)]
*  They fell for drinking bleach in the koi pond [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=323.5s)]
*  They're susceptible to the deception the American people were fine [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=326.9s)]
*  The only deception the most important deception that we uncovered is the media and we won't be fooled again to quote Pete Townsend [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=331.7s)]
*  We fooled again [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=338.98s)]
*  Jessica your face Jessica you can't in your face me. It's my own segment in your face Jessica segment [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=340.98s)]
*  Yeah, real quick. You know who didn't fall for it the American people did fall for it [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=347.3s)]
*  Donald Trump is president and he won the presidency by all accounts by a large margin and he won the presidency [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=351.02s)]
*  Because of everything that happened in the years leading up to him running for president to include [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=356.46s)]
*  Democrats running January 6 videos at nauseam [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=360.9s)]
*  I mean, I think you would agree the message got out about January 6 the American people had a fair shake [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=363.7s)]
*  At deciding how much it mattered [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=368.34s)]
*  But what also got out were the riots in 2020 were the way that this is happening things [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=370.21999999999997s)]
*  Where where Democrats spit in your face and tell you that it's raining [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=376.3s)]
*  Oh Gavin Newsom, but these aren't riots Jimmy Kimmel. These aren't riots. There's nothing going on [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=379.74s)]
*  Okay [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=384.3s)]
*  Well the American people get a chance to judge and if this is the best the Democrats have to offer is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=384.82s)]
*  Riots in response to immigration policy man, JD Vance better buckle up because he's got eight years left [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=389.7s)]
*  After these yeah as president. Well, at least Trump is leaving the marine. So that's exciting. Are you sure? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo0JqWDVN0&t=396.46s)]
