*  She's like an 80 year old leftist in a used bookstore. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, she may look fresh, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=3.6s)]
*  but she's as stale as an abandoned futon on the street. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=6.9s)]

*  I heard that at Berkeley in 1983. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=11.8s)]
*  So their problem is, and the reason why [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=14.76s)]
*  they don't have any ideas is they operate on half opinions. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=16.94s)]
*  Like, what if we get rid of cash bail? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=20.26s)]
*  Oh, let's do it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=23.34s)]
*  What happens? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=24.16s)]
*  You have repeat criminals wreaking havoc. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=25.0s)]
*  What if we have sanctuary cities? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=27.44s)]
*  Hey, let's do it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=29.3s)]
*  What happens? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=30.32s)]
*  You have rapists and killers, you know, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=31.16s)]
*  finding sanctuary, safe haven. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=32.96s)]
*  What if we give trans rights, rights that we don't have? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, you just ruined women's sports. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  You ruined safe spaces. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=39.92s)]
*  You made kids' lives hell, but you don't think about, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=41.32s)]
*  they never think about what their ideas incentivize. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeTUzSinhYs&t=44.260000000000005s)]
