*  Not happen like how and where you lost men [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=0.0s)]
*  It's whether you're actually going to listen to the answer that is given with given to you the party in its current state [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Cannot listen to the answer because if you define the natural traits of men [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=9.32s)]
*  The masculine traits is toxic. Whatever you hear from men is going to strengthen your distaste [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=15.24s)]
*  You know, there's there's some basic traits all men have that are essentially they're born with literally [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=21.96s)]
*  Self-defense they're built. They have more muscle self-defense security [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=28.74s)]

*  Real women not women that say they're women. These are the basic things that all men want [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=41.22s)]
*  I'll throw in pizza [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  But if you look at all of those things through the prism of oppression [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=51.34s)]
*  You just give it up your party's dead [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNz6Z-A2iU&t=56.78s)]
