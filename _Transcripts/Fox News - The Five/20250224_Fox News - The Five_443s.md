# Kamala goes back to her ‘tired, Trump-bashing routine’: Watters
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8)
*  Democrats refusing to unburden themselves from the losers who got them shellacked at the ballot box. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=0.0s)]
*  Instead, they're doling out participation trophies. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=5.3s)]
*  Kamala Harris receiving the prestigious Chairman's Prize at the NAACP Image Awards [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=8.2s)]
*  and going back to her tired Trump-bashing routine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=13.5s)]
*  Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=18.0s)]
*  the shadows gathering over our democracy, and ask, what do we do now? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=26.5s)]
*  But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before, and we will do it again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=36.0s)]
*  But hey, when you've got no message, what else can you do? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=46.0s)]
*  It's no wonder why James Carville is trying to give liberals hope [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=48.5s)]
*  that all they have to do is sit back and hope President Trump will implode. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=51.5s)]
*  I believe that this administration, in less than 30 days, in the midst of a massive collapse, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=57.5s)]
*  in particularly a collapse in public opinion, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=64.5s)]
*  it's going to be easy pickings here in six weeks. Just lay back. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=69.5s)]
*  I think the House Democrats, and this is going to shock a lot of people, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=76.5s)]
*  I think they know exactly what they're doing, and they know exactly what's going to happen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=79.5s)]
*  Do you think that's a good strategy, Jessica, just to sit back and wait for Trump to implode? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=85.5s)]
*  I think it's better than standing outside of the Department of Education singing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=91.5s)]
*  I think that is a better approach. But they're not just sitting back and waiting. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=97.5s)]
*  They're talking about what's actually going on. They're talking about the Doge Cuts. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=101.5s)]
*  They're steering people towards the Wall Street Journal analysis, which said, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=105.5s)]
*  you've heard these huge numbers, like $55 billion in cuts. It's actually $2.6 billion. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=109.5s)]
*  And guess what? We looked under the hood of those as well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=113.5s)]
*  And they're doing things like cutting clinical trials for Alzheimer's or the 9-11 health fund. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=115.5s)]
*  Restored. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=121.5s)]
*  Oh, after it was a mistake and then restored? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=122.5s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=124.5s)]
*  Great. So add that to the list of things that Elon Musk could have waited five seconds to do, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=125.5s)]
*  and then we could be in a better place. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=129.5s)]
*  You can't keep making the same point. Yeah, they make mistakes and they fix it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=131.5s)]
*  Listen to the little lady, Jessica. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=134.5s)]
*  Well, then explain how people are parading around these massive numbers, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=136.5s)]
*  and the numbers are actually a lot smaller. And what really matters in all of this, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=140.5s)]
*  and the Democrats are hammering it, is that in the bill that the Republicans are putting forward, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=144.5s)]
*  there will be $880 billion cut to Medicaid. And you see Republicans all over the country, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=150.5s)]
*  and no, Jesse, these are not plants that are showing up at their town halls. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=156.5s)]
*  I never said that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=159.5s)]
*  But you were thinking that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=161.5s)]
*  You were thinking that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=162.5s)]
*  You have back to it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=163.5s)]
*  Okay, so I had to do off. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=164.5s)]
*  They were actually people who worked at the CDC in Richmond Cormitt's district. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=166.5s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=169.5s)]
*  But people are showing up in Oklahoma, in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Wisconsin, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=170.5s)]
*  and they're saying what's going on at Doge is unacceptable, and are you kidding me, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=176.5s)]
*  with these Medicaid cuts? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=180.5s)]
*  Yeah, you guys listen to the voters. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=181.5s)]
*  Trillion-style. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=182.5s)]
*  It's like the first time you listen to the voters, Jessica. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=183.5s)]
*  We are trying. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=185.5s)]
*  So is Jessica saying that we're not cutting enough? That's the argument? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=186.5s)]
*  I think what she's saying is that we should really just cut, like, maybe double it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=191.5s)]
*  Jessica's not saying that at all. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=197.5s)]
*  Jessica's not saying that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=198.5s)]
*  Here's the other thing that's happening, is that if you look at the people who are out there [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=199.5s)]
*  communicating for the Democrats, James Carville's on TV a lot, and a lot of us might say, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=205.5s)]
*  well, at least he was the one saying, Democrats, you're losing the working class. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=209.5s)]
*  Democrats, you're losing men. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=212.5s)]
*  But also, he wrote an op-ed saying that Kamala Harris was going to win by a landslide, okay? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=214.5s)]
*  So when he says the Trump administration is going to implode in 30 days, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=219.5s)]
*  I think we can take that for what it's worth. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=225.5s)]
*  Also, this past weekend, the New York Times has this huge profile about Senator Chris Murphy [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=228.5s)]
*  saying he's such a breakthrough, and he's so refreshing, and he's so great. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=234.5s)]
*  The guy acts like the election never happened. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=239.5s)]
*  He's still talking about Hitler and the constitutional crisis, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=241.5s)]
*  and that Republicans only love billionaires, and that they're racists and fascists, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=244.5s)]
*  and it's obviously not what happened, and they are spiraling in this case. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=248.5s)]
*  Greg, were you surprised that you didn't receive the NAACP image award? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=254.5s)]
*  I've done so much work. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=258.5s)]
*  You have? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=259.5s)]
*  You know why Doug Emhoff was at the NAACP? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=260.5s)]
*  He thought the N stood for nanny. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=262.5s)]
*  But Carville is right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=265.5s)]
*  It's the best strategy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=268.5s)]
*  I hope the Democrats don't listen and they embarrass themselves continuously, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=269.5s)]
*  because who's more likely to get hit by a car? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=273.5s)]
*  Some guy sitting on the couch eating popcorn or a guy going outside to run. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=276.5s)]
*  Guy running. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=281.5s)]
*  So the Republicans are in power. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=282.5s)]
*  They're out there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=283.5s)]
*  They're actually playing in traffic. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=284.5s)]
*  So sooner or later, something's going to happen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=286.5s)]
*  It's just the odds are something will happen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=288.5s)]
*  It might be a catastrophe. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=290.5s)]
*  It might not. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=292.5s)]
*  The Dems just have to sit back and hope that their pathetic nature draws less attention [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=293.5s)]
*  and hope, upon hope, that the Republicans run into something ugly. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=299.5s)]
*  What's great about Trump is he knows this and he doesn't care. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=303.5s)]
*  He's still willing to take the risks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=306.5s)]
*  He takes lots of risks every day. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=308.5s)]
*  And what Carville is saying is that you kind of have, if you're rooting for something to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=310.5s)]
*  befall Trump, you're also saying it about America, because his success and America's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=316.5s)]
*  success are intertwined. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=321.5s)]
*  As a populist who believes America first, America's priorities are in line with his. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=322.5s)]
*  So if you want him to suffer, you're going to want America to suffer too. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=327.5s)]
*  And that makes you an anti-American commie pig. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=330.5s)]
*  Does that make them an anti-American commie pig? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=333.5s)]
*  The spending does. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=336.5s)]
*  The spending is absolutely communistic. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=337.5s)]
*  The idea of redistribution, which Bernie Sanders has been pushing for decades. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=339.5s)]
*  Bernie Sanders became one of the elites. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=345.5s)]
*  It's the elites in the party and the establishment that allowed them to go forward with this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=348.5s)]
*  anti-Trump Trump is Hitler narrative, which was devoid of ideas. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=354.5s)]
*  And now they're stuck. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=359.5s)]
*  They don't have any leader. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=361.5s)]
*  Like they kind of had Biden and then he fell apart. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=362.5s)]
*  So they kind of had Kamala, but they couldn't really get behind her because they knew she [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=365.5s)]
*  was incompetent. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=368.5s)]
*  It was Obama pulling the strings. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=369.5s)]
*  And even now with his billion dollar library, they can't even call it that because it's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=371.5s)]
*  too big. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=376.5s)]
*  He can't get donors for his big, dumb, ugly library because he no longer has juice inside [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=377.5s)]
*  or outside of the party. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=383.5s)]
*  So with the Obamas waning and Biden on political death store, I don't know what they have left. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=385.5s)]
*  What you should have left is a series of ideas that will appeal to the working class that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=393.5s)]
*  they lost, but they will not pivot to that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=398.5s)]
*  Instead, they're sticking with this anti-Trump narrative that it goes to anti-Elon. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=401.5s)]
*  None of it is going to work. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=406.5s)]
*  And I know people are very optimistic in the Democrat Party about the midterms in 2026. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=408.5s)]
*  At this point, you better start getting it together because their entire coalition has [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=414.5s)]
*  been left behind because they turn their backs on them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=419.5s)]
*  They turn their backs on them. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=421.5s)]
*  They turn their backs on them. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=423.5s)]
*  Get it together. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=424.5s)]
*  Still available. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=425.5s)]
*  Still available where books are sold. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=426.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rndo3mRu_X8&t=438.5s)]
