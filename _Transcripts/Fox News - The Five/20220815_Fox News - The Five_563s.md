# What Afghanistan looks like a year after Biden’s exit
**Fox News - The Five:** [August 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us)
*  Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=0.0s)]
*  No, it is not. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=3.84s)]
*  Wow, that didn't pan out. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=7.16s)]
*  One year ago today, the Taliban swept into Kabul and seized total control of Afghanistan [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=9.84s)]
*  after President Biden made the decision to withdraw American troops. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=14.32s)]
*  Trey Yngst is live in Kabul. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=18.36s)]
*  Hey Trey, how you doing? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=19.92s)]
*  Hey Greg, good afternoon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=23.52s)]
*  Today, the Taliban took a victory lap, piling into pickup trucks [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=24.52s)]
*  and driving through the capital of Kabul. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=28.52s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=30.88s)]
*  Right now, the Taliban is parading through the streets of Kabul. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=31.88s)]
*  They're marking one year since the takeover of Afghanistan. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=37.16s)]
*  You can see these fighters here celebrating. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=41.64s)]
*  Many civilians though remain in hiding, uncertain about what comes next for their country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=46.08s)]
*  As his mother looks on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=53.8s)]
*  Last year has been anything but a celebration for the Afghan people. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=55.8s)]
*  When you look at the situation on the ground, the economy has collapsed, plunging millions [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  of people into poverty. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=64.28s)]
*  Women's rights have decreased and the security situation remains fragile. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=66.32s)]
*  But when you walk through the streets of Kabul, there is a sense of routine and normalcy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=69.8s)]
*  There are street vendors selling food, there's traffic, people are out and about. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=73.92s)]
*  But behind that veneer sits uncertainty and fear for Afghan civilians, especially those [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=77.8s)]
*  American allies who were working with the United States during the last 20 years. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  We spoke with the Taliban extensively about their views on Islamic law and also women's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=87.84s)]
*  rights and education. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  But we had a very interesting conversation with an official from the foreign ministry [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=93.96s)]
*  this week when I pressed him on the Taliban's view of the US drone strike that took place [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=97.56s)]
*  last month, taking out the leader of Al-Qaeda, Aiman al-Zawahiri. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=102.52s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=106.12s)]
*  Late last month, the leader of Al-Qaeda, Aiman al-Zawahiri, was killed in a US drone strike [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=107.56s)]
*  in Kabul. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=113.56s)]
*  Did the Taliban know he was here? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan made it very clear that the leadership was not aware [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=117.4s)]
*  of either his arrival nor his presence in Kabul. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  And they will continue to conduct the investigation to verify facts. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=127.64s)]
*  But the fact of the matter remains that this was a grave violation of international law [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=136.84s)]
*  by the United States of America, conducting unilateral actions inside a sovereign state. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=142.84s)]
*  The bottom line is you can't take the Taliban at face value. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=151.36s)]
*  You can't trust what they say when you interview them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=154.46s)]
*  But the most important thing here is the civilian population, especially those who were US allies [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=157.9s)]
*  working with the United States. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=163.1s)]
*  And when we were here last year on the runway at Kabul's International Airport, when those [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=164.98s)]
*  evacuations were taking place, we thought this couldn't get any worse for these individuals. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=168.7s)]
*  They have to leave their entire lives behind. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=174.56s)]
*  And if they can't get on those planes, they have to stay here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  But we are back a year later and things have gotten worse. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=179.33999999999997s)]
*  And they appear that they are getting worse each and every day for every person here under [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  Taliban control. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  Greg. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  So Will, I want to try to distinguish between the decision to leave, which Trump had signed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=190.7s)]
*  I mean, this was something we're doing and how it was carried out in which you couldn't [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=195.72s)]
*  do much worse. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=199.61999999999998s)]
*  And I think, can you separate those two? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=201.28s)]
*  You know, I don't even know if you can separate the exit from the 20-year debacle that was [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  our investment in Afghanistan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  Yes, we can criticize and we should criticize the exit because to your point, Greg, I don't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  know that it could have been done worse. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  The estimates are 800 American citizens left behind. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=215.72s)]
*  No long-term plans, no organized plans to get us out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=220.14s)]
*  So what was accomplished before that catastrophic exit? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  Whatever it was, we gave it all back in 12 months' time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=227.72s)]
*  I mean, women's rights are gone. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=230.18s)]
*  You know, Al-Qaeda has a presence, clearly, with Ayman al-Zawahiri there at the time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=232.94s)]
*  And my big takeaway is, yes, it's worth looking into the past, but also why don't we let it [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=237.82s)]
*  inform the present and the future. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=240.96s)]
*  And the same group that so advocated for our presence and even our exit in this manner [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=242.22s)]
*  from Afghanistan was the one itching to go into Ukraine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=247.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=249.88s)]
*  You know, Richard, I mean, you were nodding along and I think that what is the lesson [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=250.88s)]
*  learned here about something that we were holding and then the moment we left, it all [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=255.64s)]
*  returned the way it was? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=260.5s)]
*  There is a lesson in there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=262.0s)]
*  Oh, there's definitely a lesson and I think the lesson is threefold. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=263.32s)]
*  I think lesson number one is our lawmakers have got to be more thoughtful. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=265.94s)]
*  For 20 years, yes, people lap up a lot of blame at Joe Biden and fair enough, those [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=269.94s)]
*  criticisms are fair. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=273.48s)]
*  But think about this, for 20 years, members of Congress approved budget after budget after [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=274.70000000000005s)]
*  budget and nobody asked to say, so you say there's 300, 800, 8000 Afghani troops, can [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=279.98s)]
*  I go look at them? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=285.5s)]
*  Can I see them? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  Are they there? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=287.62s)]
*  Clearly, they were not. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=288.62s)]
*  And I think what makes this so frustrating for me is that this war started when I was [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=289.62s)]
*  a freshman in high school. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=292.98s)]
*  I am now 35 years old. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=294.3s)]
*  This country lays in ruin. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  American blood was spread all across this country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  These are my classmates. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=301.14000000000004s)]
*  These are my neighbors. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=302.14000000000004s)]
*  These are my friends. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=303.2s)]
*  And now we're sitting here and watching this country go into a dismal collapse and the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=304.52s)]
*  question I'm asking myself, similar to Will, is why were we there in the first place? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=307.92s)]
*  And we're also dealing with the fact that there was so much mission creep. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=311.42s)]
*  At first it was we're going to get bin Laden. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=314.2s)]
*  Then it was we're going to go build a democracy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=316.08s)]
*  Then it was we're going to surge. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=318.24s)]
*  Then we're going to take them away. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=319.52s)]
*  Then we're going to surge again. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=320.52s)]
*  And the American people were left in the middle trying to figure out what's really happening [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=322.08s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=324.8s)]
*  I think, you know, Dana, just listening to both of them, it's something about you can't [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=326.4s)]
*  really make any progress if there's no prosperity in a country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=332.14s)]
*  It's like you try to think they're going to be like once they figure this out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=337.38s)]
*  But if they have no way, then it's always going to revert back to what it was. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=340.5s)]
*  And that's a story from all around the world, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=344.7s)]
*  That's why one of the reasons when Kamala Harris says she's going to Latin America and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=346.22s)]
*  she's going to figure out the root causes, you actually have to figure out one corruption. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=348.98s)]
*  That is a big issue. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=352.34000000000003s)]
*  Education, it's a big issue. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=353.9s)]
*  And part of that is if you're going to make 50 percent of your population not allowed [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=355.18s)]
*  to leave the house without being fully covered, you can't go to a doctor if you're a woman, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=359.08s)]
*  you're not going to be able to be educated. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=362.72s)]
*  You're going to suppress 50 percent of your human capital. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=364.36s)]
*  You're going to have problems. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=367.84s)]
*  When President Biden decided to do this, his poll numbers, the way that he did it, the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=370.32s)]
*  poll numbers never recovered. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=375.72s)]
*  That's just true. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=377.08s)]
*  You can look at it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=378.08s)]
*  It's just like they went down. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=379.08s)]
*  They got to a point where people said we are embarrassed by this incompetence. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=380.08s)]
*  And then everything else started happening. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=384.24s)]
*  Gas prices continue to rise and inflation increase. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=385.72s)]
*  Conditions were not being met. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=389.1s)]
*  President Trump said, we will leave if this happens. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=390.3s)]
*  Those things that were supposed to happen were not happening and they left anyway. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=394.34s)]
*  As you saw with Salman Rushdie, our enemies, people against freedom are very patient. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=397.54s)]
*  So for us, we're like, oh, since I was a freshman in high school, I can't take it anymore. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=405.34s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=409.34s)]
*  I absolutely get it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=410.34s)]
*  And there is an obligation on behalf of leaders to say, this is why we're doing this, this [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=411.34s)]
*  is why it matters. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=414.7s)]
*  That went away. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=415.7s)]
*  And so we have that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=416.7s)]
*  I would add this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=418.32s)]
*  In addition to the 800 citizens that were left, 96% of special immigration visa holders, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=419.68s)]
*  the people who actually were on the ground, the Afghans who helped us along with our forces [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=425.08s)]
*  who helped save their lives, they didn't make it up. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=428.2s)]
*  And right now at the State Department, it would take them 18 years to deal with the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=431.24s)]
*  backlog that they have. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=434.68s)]
*  So the incompetence continues at the bureaucratic level. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=436.12s)]
*  Daegan, I was told that this was the new improved Taliban. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm extremely disappointed. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  You are. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=448.12s)]
*  I'm a woman. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=449.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=450.12s)]
*  You identify as a woman. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=451.12s)]
*  Today? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=454.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=455.12s)]
*  You're going to get me in trouble. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=456.12s)]
*  To Dana's point, I looked at the poll numbers, the overlay of approval versus disapproval. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=458.5s)]
*  August 20th is the day that he went from a net approval rating to a net disapproval. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=464.5s)]
*  And Joe Biden has been deep in the red ever since then. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=471.1s)]
*  Because of, to Dana's point, his incompetence, I call it his stubborn stupidity. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=474.94s)]
*  But also on full display was how he blithely lies to the American people over and over [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=482.26s)]
*  and over again repeatedly. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=489.94s)]
*  And I think that that was what turned Americans against him. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=491.82s)]
*  When George Stephanopoulos says, your top military leaders warned against withdrawing [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=495.65999999999997s)]
*  on this timeline. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=501.3s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=502.3s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=503.3s)]
*  Yes, they did. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=504.3s)]
*  U.S. troops, Biden said, U.S. troops will stay in, stay until all Americans are out [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=505.3s)]
*  of Afghanistan. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=510.22s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=511.22s)]
*  Al Qaeda's gone from Afghanistan. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=512.58s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=514.34s)]
*  Our allies are with us. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=515.58s)]
*  No, they weren't. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=516.82s)]
*  If you're an American, you can get to the airport. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=517.86s)]
*  No, they couldn't. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=520.22s)]
*  Over and over and over again, he stood up in front of the American people and lied. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=521.8s)]
*  And a lot of, so many people just said, we're done. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=526.12s)]
*  We don't trust you. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  There's the door. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=531.1800000000001s)]
*  And then they wanted credit for the largest airlift in history. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's amazing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  Here's our screw up. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=535.8199999999999s)]
*  It broke records. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=536.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=537.8199999999999s)]
*  Up next, even some Democrats are having to admit Texas migrant busing strategy, it's [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIRTzFa4Us&t=538.8199999999999s)]
