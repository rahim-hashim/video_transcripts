# ‘The Five’ pushes back on Dem rising star’s political hot takes: ‘Misreading the situation’
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc)
*  Our favorite train wreck Democrats back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=0.0s)]
*  Rising star Jasmine Crockett thinks she can unite [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=2.2s)]
*  our bitterly divided country [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=5.54s)]
*  by smearing Trump supporters as mentally ill. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  It is sick. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  It is really sick. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=12.42s)]
*  And anybody that supports it is also sick. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=13.42s)]
*  And so, you know, we've got a mental health crisis [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=17.18s)]
*  in this country because everyone, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=19.72s)]
*  no matter how you affiliate yourself, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=22.0s)]
*  should be against Trump, period. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  This is not partisan for me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=26.86s)]
*  Crockett's deep thoughts didn't end there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=29.46s)]
*  She also thinks Slippery Joe is mentally fine. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=31.96s)]
*  And Kamala got robbed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=35.46s)]
*  Even if we want to say, which I refuse to accept, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=38.26s)]
*  that Joe Biden was mentally deficient, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=42.24s)]
*  let me tell you something. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  His mental deficiency is still a thousand times better [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=45.64s)]
*  than what we currently have. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=49.22s)]
*  Kamala Harris, light years ahead of Donald Trump, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  as it relates to qualifications, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=55.78s)]
*  as it relates to her overall resume, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  then you had a younger, qualified, non-felon candidate, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=59.68s)]
*  and somehow the people still chose the old white man. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=65.78s)]
*  Mary Catherine Hamm, the Democrats don't seem [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=71.72s)]
*  to have really reconciled with what happened in November. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=73.86s)]
*  Yes, I think she's misreading the situation, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=78.26s)]
*  and that could be dangerous for Democrats [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=81.30000000000001s)]
*  if she continues to be the leader or the spokesperson, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=82.94s)]
*  spiritual spokesperson of this party. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=86.46s)]
*  What she's, she's in a D plus 30 district, okay? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=88.8s)]
*  She's doing D plus 30 messaging [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=92.94s)]
*  when they need to be talking to districts. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=95.58s)]
*  I looked up a handful of them, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=97.24s)]
*  these toss up districts that are held by Democrats [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  that they need to win to take the house back in 2026. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=100.28s)]
*  The most favorable is D plus two. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=103.42s)]
*  Those messages do not sell to the people [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=106.02s)]
*  who live in that district, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=108.78s)]
*  or at least a very small percentage of them [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=110.12s)]
*  is what you're gonna be stuck with. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  And that's not how you turn the page. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=112.92s)]
*  I hesitate to tell them this, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=114.82s)]
*  because I'd love for her to be in charge. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=116.56s)]
*  Do you have any advice for the Democrats, Jessica? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=117.86s)]
*  Talk about the Medicaid cuts. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  Medicaid reform. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=124.5s)]
*  Oh, sorry, I forgot your spin. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=126.5s)]
*  Medicaid reform means you don't have health care anymore, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=128.4s)]
*  and your rural hospitals will be gone. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=132.34s)]
*  Mary Catherine's completely correct. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=134.88s)]
*  There is a totally different way that people talk [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  when they live in an enormously safe seat, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=139.14s)]
*  and you would never catch like a Pat Ryan [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=141.68s)]
*  or someone like that speaking that way. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=145.22s)]
*  But that's how the party is composed, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=146.62s)]
*  and she does rile up a certain faction of it [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=149.52s)]
*  who continues to consume clickbait content about this, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=152.02s)]
*  to keep smashing that donate button. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=155.86s)]
*  The grassroots is still alive and well [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=158.4s)]
*  with giving money to the party. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=160.24s)]
*  It's the big donors that are taking a break. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=161.86s)]
*  But I do, and I hate to repeat myself, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  but not that much, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=166.34s)]
*  because I wanna emphasize how important it is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  that people stop feigning outrage [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=170.0s)]
*  when a Democrat insults Republicans. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  We are so past basket of deplorables when you say, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  oh my God, I can't believe she talks [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=177.32s)]
*  about Republicans this way. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  There are a litany of names that top Republicans, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  including our commander in chief, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=184.02s)]
*  have called Democrats treasonous, un-American, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=186.06s)]
*  scum, warped, radical, just a few of them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=189.32s)]
*  I don't wanna hear the complaints anymore. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=192.26s)]
*  But isn't he talking about specific politicians? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=193.76s)]
*  No, actually, I have a list of that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=195.56s)]
*  So for Biden and Kamala, low IQ, dog. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=197.3s)]
*  Yeah, these are the most officials. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=199.8s)]
*  No, these are, this, I went back and looked [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  because I knew we would talk about this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=203.82s)]
*  As I would often say to Jim Acosta, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=205.56s)]
*  give me the full quote of where he insulted [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=206.82s)]
*  a broad swath of Democrats. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  Do you have the full quote? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=212.26s)]
*  I will send you all the links. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=214.1s)]
*  You sound like Jim Acosta. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=215.2s)]
*  Well, and here's the thing, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=216.64s)]
*  here's the thing, no matter what he says, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=217.48s)]
*  he actually has a record of appealing to Democrats [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=219.33999999999997s)]
*  from across the aisle to bring those voters [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=222.48s)]
*  over into the Republican coalition, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  and Crockett does not have the same experience [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=226.44s)]
*  in doing that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=228.33999999999997s)]
*  That's what you say. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  All the fake election. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  I assure you, you will not find [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  Hillary Clinton basket of deplorables, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  Biden, Republicans are a clear and present danger, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=234.94s)]
*  Neanderthal thinking they're garbage, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=237.28s)]
*  Obama, bitter, they cling to their guns, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=239.6s)]
*  religion, antipathy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  These were about voters. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=242.58s)]
*  And I have challenged many Democrats, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=244.74s)]
*  give me all the quotes from Donald J. Trump [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  smearing half of the country. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  They don't exist, to Jesse's exact point, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=251.02s)]
*  those are about specific elected officials. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=253.18s)]
*  Maybe you don't like them, fine, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUSum8Pusc&t=256.06s)]
