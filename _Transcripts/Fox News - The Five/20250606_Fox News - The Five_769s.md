*  Children, and it gets even more [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=39.7s)]
*  disturbing from their attorney [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=41.4s)]
*  General Pam Bondi is laying it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=42.94s)]
*  all out. He was a smuggler of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=44.8s)]
*  humans and Children and women. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=47.14s)]
*  He made over 100 trips. The [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=50.78s)]
*  grand jury found that he was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=54.22s)]

*  according to co conspirators [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=63.12s)]
*  who were under his control while [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=65.12s)]
*  transporting them throughout our [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=67.12s)]
*  country. This defendant [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=69.12s)]

*  solicited nude photographs and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=77.24s)]
*  videos of a minor. The defendant [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=79.24s)]

*  member's mother. The charges [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  stem from a traffic stop in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=89.3s)]
*  Tennessee back in 2022. A [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=91.3s)]

*  enforcement officers to suspect [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  him of involvement in human [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=96.14s)]
*  trafficking. And now the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=100.22s)]
*  Democrats and the media are [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=102.22s)]
*  going to have some big [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  questions to answer for after [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  turning a brego's case into a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  real-life case. The court [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  ruled that the defendant was [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=110.25999999999999s)]

*  smuggling and drug trafficking. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=114.28s)]
*  And now the defendant was [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=116.28s)]
*  released into a rallying [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=118.28s)]
*  crime. The Supreme Court orders [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=120.28s)]
*  the Trump administration to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=122.28s)]
*  return the Maryland father who [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=124.30000000000001s)]
*  is mistakenly deported to El [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=126.30000000000001s)]
*  Salvador's notorious prison. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=128.3s)]
*  Maryland father. Maryland father [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=130.3s)]
*  Maryland father. He will not [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=132.3s)]
*  return the Maryland father [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=133.3s)]
*  Maryland father. The Trump [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=134.3s)]
*  administration claims it is not [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=136.3s)]
*  required to bring back Kilmar [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=138.3s)]
*  Brego Garcia. The president [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=140.36s)]
*  said, quote, as I have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=141.34s)]
*  repeatedly said, this is not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=143.34s)]
*  about the man. It's about his [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=145.36s)]
*  constitutional rights and the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=147.36s)]
*  rights of all. The [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=149.36s)]
*  administration will now have to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=150.36s)]
*  make its case in the court of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=151.36s)]
*  law as it should have all [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=153.36s)]
*  along. And get this. The media [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=155.36s)]
*  is still pumping out the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=157.36s)]
*  Maryland man narrative. Axios [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=159.36s)]
*  just tweeted, quote, breaking [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=162.38000000000002s)]
*  wrongly deported Maryland [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=164.38000000000002s)]
*  father. The president said, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=166.38000000000002s)]
*  quote, this is not about the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=168.38000000000002s)]
*  Maryland father. The president [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=169.46s)]
*  said, quote, breaking wrongly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=170.46s)]
*  deported Maryland man. Kilmar [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=172.46s)]
*  Brego Garcia is on his way back [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=174.46s)]
*  to the U.S. Because that's all [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=176.46s)]
*  it was to the media for quite [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=178.44s)]
*  some time. We saw it headline [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=180.44s)]
*  after headline, Jesse. The [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=181.44s)]
*  Maryland man. Not just [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=183.44s)]
*  headlines. Jessica called him [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=185.44s)]
*  the Maryland man. I did not. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=186.44s)]
*  Yes, you did. No, I did not. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=188.44s)]
*  I used his name like a grownup. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=190.44s)]
*  You called him a Maryland dad. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=192.44s)]
*  And now the Maryland dad is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=194.44s)]
*  accused of killing a rival gang [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=196.44s)]
*  member. I don't want to call [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=198.54000000000002s)]
*  him a Maryland dad. I don't [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  want to call him a Maryland [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  dad. But I don't want him back [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  here. I don't think they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  should have brought him back. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  This is a national security [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  situation. The guy's a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  designated terrorist. He [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  belongs somewhere else. What [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  are we going to do? We're [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=214.54000000000002s)]
*  going to spend two years and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=215.58s)]
*  $50 million trying this guy [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=217.58s)]
*  imprisoning this guy, feeding [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=219.62s)]
*  them, giving him health care [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=221.62s)]
*  and then flying him home. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=222.62s)]
*  Permission to make an analogy [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=224.62s)]
*  to this guy. I don't want to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=226.78s)]
*  call him a Maryland dad. I [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=228.78s)]
*  don't want to call him a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=230.78s)]
*  Maryland dad. I don't want to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=232.78s)]
*  wash before you return it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=234.82s)]
*  What's the point? It's not [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=236.82s)]
*  your car, and it's going back [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=238.86s)]
*  anyway. They say they care [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=240.86s)]
*  about the rule of law. They [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=242.86s)]
*  don't. That's why they raided [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=244.86s)]
*  Trump's house and tried to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=245.86s)]
*  strip him off the ballot and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=246.86s)]
*  fine him $500 million. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=248.86s)]
*  They're just trying to throw [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=250.9s)]
*  sand in the process because [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=252.94s)]
*  they want all these guys to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=253.98000000000002s)]
*  be in the process. You know [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=256.34s)]
*  the word, Jessica. This guy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=258.34s)]
*  is such a bad ombre. He's the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=260.34s)]
*  baddest of bad ombres. He was [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=262.34s)]
*  caught soliciting child porn. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=264.34s)]
*  He was trafficking humans, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=266.34s)]
*  drugs, weapons. He beat his [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=268.34s)]
*  wife twice with a closed [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=270.34s)]
*  fist. The Democrats don't [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=272.34s)]

*  what the party is. It's a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=278.36s)]

*  they spent $7 billion, and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=282.36s)]
*  there's only seven charging [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=283.36s)]

*  one who's going to be deported. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=346.66s)]
*  It's up to Bukele. Well, I [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=348.66s)]
*  guess he could get him back. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=350.66s)]
*  And I do think it is a victory [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=352.66s)]
*  for the rule of law that he [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=354.66s)]
*  will go. He'll have his due [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=356.66s)]
*  process, and then he'll probably [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=358.66s)]
*  end up in a jail, and then after [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=360.66s)]
*  that's done, then he'll be [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=362.66s)]
*  deported, if it turns out that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=364.66s)]
*  this is true. But they should [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=366.66s)]
*  now systematically go through [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=368.66s)]
*  the process and do it the legal [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=370.66s)]
*  way. You say we're a party of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=372.66s)]
*  lawyers. I don't think that's as [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=374.66s)]
*  embarrassing as you think, and you [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=376.66s)]
*  would probably do better if you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=378.66s)]
*  had more high-quality lawyers in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=380.66s)]
*  your party. Lawyers are rated [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=382.66s)]
*  below Congress, and Congress is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=384.66s)]
*  at like 12% approval. It's not [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=386.66s)]
*  about approval, it's about [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=388.66s)]
*  effectiveness. Do you think this [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=390.66s)]
*  is effective? Yeah. Wasting a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=392.66s)]
*  million dollars, bringing a guy [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=394.66s)]
*  back and forth. The American [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=396.66s)]
*  government is not going to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=398.66s)]
*  support this. We already support [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=400.66s)]
*  people getting their due process. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=402.66s)]
*  We know he has a constitutional [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=404.66s)]
*  right to this. It comes from Antonin [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=406.66s)]
*  Scalia himself affirming it, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=408.66s)]
*  saying there are due process [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=410.66s)]
*  rights afforded to people who are [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=412.66s)]
*  here illegally. He's a terrorist. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=414.66s)]
*  He might be. And then he should [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=416.66s)]
*  go to jail and then get deported [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=418.66s)]
*  home. He was already home. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=420.66s)]
*  It's so strange to me that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=422.66s)]
*  you're comfortable with people [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=424.66s)]
*  getting their due process when [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=426.66s)]
*  they haven't even been convicted [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=428.66s)]
*  of anything. I don't understand [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=430.66s)]
*  that. I understand getting people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=432.66s)]
*  who are here legally out. I [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=434.66s)]
*  understand what the election was [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=436.66s)]
*  about. I am not one of those [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=438.66s)]
*  Democratic deniers that can't see [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=440.66s)]
*  the writing on the wall about the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=442.66s)]
*  immigration issue. But how can you [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=444.66s)]
*  actually sit here in the comforts [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=446.66s)]
*  of our air-conditioned studio or [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=448.66s)]
*  in your big, nice house and be [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=450.66s)]
*  comfortable knowing that there are [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=452.66s)]
*  people who are here illegally. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=454.66s)]
*  And I know that's not true. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=456.66s)]
*  I mean, you know, I'm not saying [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=458.66s)]
*  that he's a terrorist. Yes, he [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=460.66s)]
*  has. He's illegal. He's been [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=462.66s)]
*  arrested. And get this. Get this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=464.66s)]
*  He's not an American citizen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=466.66s)]
*  If you want to spend all your [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=468.66s)]
*  attention trying to protect [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=470.66s)]
*  the human trafficker, you can do [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=472.66s)]
*  that. What I love about this is [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=474.66s)]
*  that in order to find this [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=476.66s)]
*  out, we had to send him to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=478.66s)]
*  El Salvador, which created this [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=480.66s)]
*  issue. Suddenly, the Maryland [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=482.66s)]
*  dad, and that's what you call [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=484.66s)]
*  them, was no Ward Cleaver, more [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=486.66s)]
*  like Freddy Krueger, a wife- [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=488.66s)]
*  beating, gang-banger, human [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=490.66s)]
*  smuggler. So if the Dems hadn't [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=492.66s)]
*  run to his defense, we might not [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=494.66s)]
*  have seen how bad they are [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=496.66s)]
*  and how stupid your party is, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=498.66s)]
*  and it's not about the man, says [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=500.66s)]
*  Van Hollen. The Dems compelled [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=502.66s)]
*  us to feel for him. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=504.66s)]
*  They wanted his name in our [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=506.66s)]
*  heads. I have seen that picture [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=508.66s)]
*  pictures of my dog Gus. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=510.66s)]
*  Why does the media always use one picture? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=512.26s)]
*  This guy, I mean, look, the picture is supposed to tell you, hey, he's a normal guy. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=515.5s)]
*  You know, he doesn't look at child porn. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=520.46s)]
*  He doesn't abseil kids. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=522.1800000000001s)]
*  Just look at him with his backward hat. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=523.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, they wanted, they demanded that we abide by their outrage narrative. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  What they didn't count on was that their poster child for persecution was actually the persecutor. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=532.58s)]
*  And unlike Van Hollen, I am sincere when I say that scumbag is irrelevant, not Van Hollen, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=539.34s)]
*  but he is a scumbag, the criminal. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=546.82s)]
*  It's the demand that the media and the Democrats have for us to accept their narrative. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=549.5400000000001s)]
*  They did this with George Floyd. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=555.1s)]
*  They did this with Michael Avenatti. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=557.08s)]
*  They did this with Jussie Smollett. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=558.94s)]
*  They did this with BLM. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=560.88s)]

*  Did I say BLM yet? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=567.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=569.62s)]
*  Every narrative that they feed us turns out to be horribly wrong. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=570.62s)]
*  They're either a poor judge of character or they don't give an F whether they're telling [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=574.02s)]
*  the truth or not. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=578.26s)]

*  their own narrative. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=583.02s)]
*  They brainwashed themselves. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=584.1800000000001s)]
*  They weren't prepared for the response. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  The public refused to believe their fantasy. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=588.54s)]

*  He's got he spent all his time in front of the cameras. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=603.38s)]
*  He's got to go out there and deal with this now. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=605.06s)]
*  But if you're going to spend your time, Kennedy, what about the undocumented females that are [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=607.54s)]
*  allegedly victims of his? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=613.42s)]
*  Where's Van Hollen and these Democrats fighting for them? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=615.46s)]
*  I mean, if you read through this, the sickening details of this now grand jury unsealed document, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=617.7s)]
*  the indictment. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=625.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=626.86s)]
*  Among other troubling findings. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=628.46s)]
*  He's a member of MS-13. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=631.46s)]
*  He transported thousands of gang members and children, abused undocumented females and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=633.3000000000001s)]
*  attempted to solicit child porn. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=638.62s)]
*  How about the victims? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=641.66s)]
*  So I think what the Democrat narrative will be that the Maryland dad is quite an entrepreneur [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=642.82s)]
*  because, you know, he had a fun little business where he was shuttling people back and forth. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=647.82s)]
*  And if you're going to make money, you got to make the most money. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=652.7s)]
*  And that's by getting kids into the country illegally because their parents will pay thousands [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=655.0200000000001s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=659.5s)]
*  They'll borrow it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=660.5s)]
*  They'll steal it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=661.5s)]
*  It doesn't matter what they do. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=662.5s)]
*  And you know, if Van Hollen is so in love with the Constitution, why didn't he take [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=663.9000000000001s)]
*  the Constitution for margaritas? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=668.1400000000001s)]
*  Why did he take a gang member? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=670.6600000000001s)]
*  And you know, it's like Democrats are sitting here every day. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=673.1800000000001s)]
*  We hear about, you know, a new focus group and a new study and a new concentration of [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=676.0s)]
*  pearl clutches who are so worried about how they got so off message and how do we lose [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=680.9s)]
*  populism to Republicans? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=685.6999999999999s)]
*  It's like by doing stuff like this, you know, it's like you choose who you defend and instead [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=687.34s)]
*  of defending, you know, defenseless women who are beaten and killed by awful people [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=692.5799999999999s)]
*  who happen to be here illegally, which, you know, does make up a minority of the people [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=698.28s)]
*  who are in this country undocumented. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=703.34s)]
*  But they're not looking out for them. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=706.1s)]
*  They're not looking out for the 200,000 children who have gone missing in this country. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=707.58s)]
*  This is the person that they chose to defend. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=712.38s)]
*  And what happens is when his real biography is written with the actual facts, it's very [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  damning for them. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=720.9000000000001s)]
*  But that's that's what they chose to bet on. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=722.14s)]
*  And unfortunately for them, it's another losing proposition. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=724.48s)]
*  Any final thoughts, Jessica? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=727.44s)]
*  Why does she get final thoughts? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=729.3000000000001s)]
*  Because she's the victim on this panel. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=731.1600000000001s)]
*  My final thought is that when this was being litigated first, when he was first supported [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=733.98s)]
*  to see Donald Trump's approval rating went down because the American public wanted to [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=740.38s)]
*  process. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=745.74s)]
*  Oh, you are so right. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=746.74s)]
*  By the way, can you explain to me what you process is? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=747.74s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=750.02s)]
*  You have to stop. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=751.02s)]
*  I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=752.02s)]
*  Final thought. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=753.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=754.62s)]
*  No final thoughts. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=755.62s)]
*  I'm going to Grand Rapids tomorrow. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75UovLmYak&t=756.62s)]
