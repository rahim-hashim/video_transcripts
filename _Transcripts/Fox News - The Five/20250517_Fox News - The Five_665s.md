# 'The Five' on Trump's MAGA MOMENTUM
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4)
*  Liberal hate to see it, but President Trump is on a roll. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=0.0s)]
*  He seemed to be adios amigos. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=3.88s)]
*  People were writing his political obituary. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=5.8s)]
*  He is rising from the dead like Methuselah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=7.68s)]
*  Look at this. Hello. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=9.96s)]
*  Trump's net approval rating among voters. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=11.48s)]
*  This is the Reuters Ipsos polling. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Look at this. In late April, he was eight points underwater. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=14.76s)]
*  But look at where he was in the most recent poll among voters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=17.64s)]
*  He's up seven points to a minus one point net favorability rating. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=20.52s)]
*  Donald Trump's not just doing better than he was doing in late April of 2025. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=24.96s)]
*  He's doing considerably better than he was doing at this point in term number one, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=28.52s)]
*  about 10 points better than he was doing at this point in terms of, you know, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=32.28s)]
*  an event. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=35.56s)]
*  47 is riding high in the polls after delivering a Middle East masterclass, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=37.04s)]
*  Jessica, bringing home trillions in new U.S. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=41.56s)]
*  investments from the Gulf States. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=44.56s)]
*  And yeah, he still found time to clap back at Bruce Springsteen's overseas [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=46.6s)]
*  meltdown where the boss called him corrupt and treasonous. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=50.52s)]
*  Trump saying Bruce is, quote, just a pushy, obnoxious jerk. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=54.32s)]
*  Who fervently supported crooked Joe Biden. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=58.48s)]
*  This dried out prune of a rocker. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=61.16s)]
*  His skin is all atrophied. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=63.08s)]
*  Ought to keep his mouth shut until he gets back into the country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=65.08s)]
*  And as he battles aging rockers, Trump's giving a lesson in humility [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  on his middies tour. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=74.6s)]
*  I'm just thinking we have a president of the United States doing the selling. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=77.44s)]
*  Do you think do you think Biden would be doing it? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=82.56s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=84.64s)]
*  But it's so important. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=86.12s)]
*  I think I have to be a cheerleader for our country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=87.2s)]
*  That's why our country is doing so well. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=90.68s)]
*  You know, the sad part, whoever's next president, let's just say whoever, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  whoever's the next president is going to say, what a great job they did. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Look, I built all these plants. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=101.28s)]
*  I built all these factories. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=103.92s)]
*  Can you imagine I'll be sitting at home? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Who the hell knows where I'll be? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  And I'll say, I did that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=108.56s)]
*  All right, Jessica, masterclass. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  It's not really in dispute. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  So my question to you is how big of a masterclass was this? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=117.2s)]
*  Not in dispute at all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Approval rating bump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  That's real life. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=127.0s)]
*  I live and die by the polls, but that is directly related to him [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  cleaning up his own tariffs mess. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=131.88s)]
*  So that's moving from the hundred and forty five percent [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=133.6s)]
*  tariff on China to just 30 percent, where, you know, you saw the CEO from Walmart, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=135.72s)]
*  I presume, saying that the prices are going to go up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=140.4s)]
*  So we'll wait for that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=142.44s)]
*  And while we were in the commercial break, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=143.16s)]
*  Moody's downgraded our credit for the first time in the agency's history. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=145.28s)]
*  So all good news all around masterclass in terms of the big headlines. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=148.56s)]
*  Any time that we're not talking about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=153.0s)]
*  the 400 million dollar bribe that he's taking from the Qataris and the jet is a good one. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=155.8s)]
*  But he's around forever. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=160.44s)]
*  What? It's been around forever, that so-called bribe. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=163.28s)]
*  They were talking to the Biden administration about it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=166.36s)]
*  Yeah. And who didn't take it? Joe Biden. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  And who did we got it for free? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=170.52s)]
*  And I would probably buy it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=172.28s)]
*  Any hoodles. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=173.72s)]
*  He has all of these big headlines, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=175.72s)]
*  We're getting all of this investment, like the eight and a half billion [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=179.0s)]
*  out of Qatar for Texas energy company McDermott. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  That was already announced in 2023 and 2024. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  Abu Dhabi, he says a new 200 billion dollars. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=189.0s)]
*  That's a cloud computing deal with Amazon, also announced during the Biden administration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=191.76s)]
*  Saudi is allegedly giving us 600 million. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=196.04s)]
*  We have a billion. I'm sorry. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=198.64s)]
*  Haven't documented all of it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  But we do know that the airport project was announced last August. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=201.88s)]
*  So the Washington Post has documented all of this, that at least a half a dozen of the contracts [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=206.04s)]
*  that he's talking about happened under the Biden administration. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=211.28s)]
*  And that is something that Trump likes to do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  He likes to show up and then take credit for things that other people did. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=215.16s)]
*  The other half, I'll give it to you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=219.2s)]
*  300 billion of the 600 billion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=220.4s)]
*  But don't go out there and say you got one point four trillion in investment when you didn't really. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=221.96s)]
*  Or at least give a nice signal to the previous guy and say, hey, actually, there is no previous guy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=225.72s)]
*  There's no we already know there was no Joe Biden. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=231.11999999999998s)]
*  So that it's kind of hard to give him any credit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  Does have a birth certificate. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  And we really him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=237.2s)]
*  Yes, he's not African. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, he claimed he was a Jewish Puerto Rican truck driver. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  Greg, we all you seem to want to challenge some of her assertions. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=246.6s)]
*  No, I just like annoying her. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  That's all. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=253.48s)]
*  We should go to the Cracker Barrel because their porch needs an aging rocker. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Trump's like a like a pound of pastrami. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=262.64000000000004s)]
*  He's on a roll. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=265.36s)]
*  It really is about your filter. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  Trump's filter is anything is possible in this world. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=269.24s)]
*  What's the Democrat filter? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=273.6s)]
*  Everything's happening to you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=275.68s)]
*  It's it's their fault. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=278.24s)]
*  That's where identity politics came from. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=280.16s)]
*  You're being oppressed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=282.24s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=283.88s)]
*  Nothing's fair. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  Bruce Springsteen goes around the world and tells everybody [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=288.24s)]
*  Trump is doing something to you, that he hops in a plane and he leaves. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=291.12s)]
*  What do those people do? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=297.0s)]
*  They have that there's nothing they can do. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=298.2s)]
*  He screwed up their mindset. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  He's telling them that they're basically victims. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=301.36s)]
*  Springsteen, it's I don't want to get into that situation [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=305.16s)]
*  where you just you go after a celebrity because he says something you disagree with [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  because you're a hypocrite. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  If you like Kid Rock, because he's pro Trump and you don't like [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  Springsteen because he's pro Biden, that's wrong. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=315.68s)]
*  What is what you can hit him for is being lame. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=318.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=322.52s)]
*  And number one, he's doing this in England. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  Number two, he's doing it in a way where there are no follow up questions [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=325.68s)]
*  to whatever he's saying. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=328.76s)]
*  And the best thing about this is is that he just creates more rebels. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=330.6s)]
*  Like this guy used to rail against the man. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=334.88s)]
*  And every time he opens his mouth, he is the man. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=338.76s)]
*  Everybody looks at him goes, God, you know what? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=342.0s)]
*  The people that he doesn't like are actually more fun. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=344.52s)]
*  These young people that he's like mad about, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=347.32s)]
*  some of them might be his fans. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  They're having a great time. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  He's now the old guy on the lawn shaking his rake at a at a cloud. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=353.2s)]
*  His voice is raspy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=358.32s)]
*  He looks like, well, I'll just leave it at that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=360.76s)]
*  OK, you've said enough about aging rockers. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  Martha, how how what do you think Jessica was trying to say there? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=368.04s)]
*  Because I couldn't really figure it out. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=375.04s)]
*  Well, she said the numbers don't necessarily add up, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=377.44s)]
*  but I would just say this, some of the response from Democrats [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=379.76000000000005s)]
*  is, you know, it's amazing what can be accomplished [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  when the president isn't f'ing brain dead, says a senior congressional [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=386.92s)]
*  Democratic aide. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  This whole Middle East trip shows for a lot that for a lot of negotiations, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=392.24s)]
*  what you really need is somebody who has the energy and levelheadedness [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=395.72s)]
*  to actually get it done. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=398.88s)]
*  And I think a lot of Democrats sit back, especially people who worked for Joe Biden, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=400.88s)]
*  and they see that he never looked at these things strategically. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=404.32s)]
*  He went in there with the fist bump because he was only thinking 30 seconds [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=408.4s)]
*  ahead of that moment. Right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  So what are people going to say when I actually greet him? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=414.08s)]
*  Then at the G20 later, he shakes his hand as if that's some sort of big [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=416.28s)]
*  accomplishment with MBS, with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=421.0s)]
*  But, you know, think back on this, because Joe Biden was never capable [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=425.2s)]
*  of this kind of bold action and thinking when it came to the Middle [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=430.08s)]
*  East, if it were up to Joe Biden, Osama bin Laden could still be alive. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=434.28s)]
*  He was a no go in that moment in the situation room. Right. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=438.28s)]
*  And that's who Joe Biden is. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=442.52s)]
*  He is not the person who's going to walk in there and shake up the chessboard [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  and say, look, we have a lot of past. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=448.2s)]
*  You know, you talk about the human rights violations. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=451.0s)]
*  Look at what look at Japan. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=453.08s)]
*  Years after World War Two, we figured out a way to work on the same page. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  No one denies 9-11. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=458.76s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that after a war, which is what we had over 9-11, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=461.56s)]
*  you have to start to put the pieces back in. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=466.88s)]
*  What do you say? How about if we're friends and we isolate Iran? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=469.08000000000004s)]
*  This is what President Trump is doing. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=473.32s)]
*  Iran is looking at all of this going, we're out in the cold. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  And maybe it's actually time that we should make a deal. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=479.64s)]
*  So that's the big message here. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=482.24s)]
*  And President Trump said, no 30 page proposal for Iran. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  It's one page. You cannot have nuclear weapons. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=487.36s)]
*  If you pursue this program, we will obliterate you. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=490.48s)]
*  So that's the choice that's on Iran's table. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  We're going to watch that really closely. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=497.20000000000005s)]
*  But Biden never had the kind of boldness to do what we saw this week. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=498.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm just still stuck on what Jessica said. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=502.20000000000005s)]
*  But you didn't even understand. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=505.0s)]
*  Hear me out. Now, I think I'm trying to figure this out. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=506.36s)]
*  So you're saying that Trump spent all week signing all of these billion dollar [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=508.72s)]
*  deals and no other person from the Biden administration put their hand up [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=513.72s)]
*  and said, we did that. That was us. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=518.48s)]
*  The first I'm hearing from it is from you, Jessica. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=520.8s)]
*  Wouldn't be the first time that I didn't think the Biden administration did their [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  comms correctly. OK. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=526.4s)]
*  You'd think someone would be like, oh, that was our deal. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  But no, it's just strange where she pulls these things out of the Washington Post. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=530.36s)]
*  Again, that doesn't help your cause. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=534.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? It's the Washington Post. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  Jeff Bezos is a Trumper now. He is. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=538.68s)]
*  Have you not been paying attention? Then it's half right. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=541.48s)]
*  Go ahead. Here's what I find hilarious, though, because everything that you said, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=543.76s)]
*  Martha, is so correct. Right. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=547.5999999999999s)]
*  The reason why Joe Biden didn't do it or couldn't is because we saw what happened [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=549.28s)]
*  after five decades. The same, the same status quo and the same leaving our blood [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=552.76s)]
*  and treasure in different countries all over the world, because no one had a bigger [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=557.2399999999999s)]
*  or a greater or different vision to not just incur and not just blow, you know, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=561.4799999999999s)]
*  blow in, but actually to say actually a long term economic investment where all [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  parties have the same vested positive interest as many of those countries that [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=571.04s)]
*  Trump met with all week were saying prior to October 7th, that all hate the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=576.2s)]
*  Iranian proxies because they are absolutely interfering with the prospect [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=579.84s)]
*  of economic flourishing under our partnership. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=584.0s)]
*  Nothing like that would have happened. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=587.12s)]
*  So the fact that a high ranking Biden official literally said like, oh, younger Joe [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=588.5200000000001s)]
*  Biden could have done that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=592.72s)]
*  They said he could have done the deal with the Houthis. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. When he was chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=597.0s)]
*  reminds me of watching the Olympics when we're all seeing, you know, that and [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=599.36s)]
*  eating chips on our couches and we're watching these like 17 year olds, you know, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=602.76s)]
*  race 10 miles in five seconds and be like, oh, she didn't point her toes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=606.2s)]
*  I give her the silver like the armchair quarterbacking and not recognizing the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=610.76s)]
*  incredible feat. This is that it shattered the norms of decades that you can [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=615.2s)]
*  only do something this way. And there's an absolute separation between business [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=620.0s)]
*  and economic interests. I mean, it kills me. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=623.84s)]
*  But what's funny is Trump calling himself like the cheerleader for America. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=626.24s)]
*  Obviously, I was like, I got it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=629.52s)]
*  And then I was like, what is the analogy? What was Biden? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=630.88s)]
*  And then I thought to myself, yeah, he was Walt Coleman. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=633.08s)]
*  He was the ref that called the tuck rule. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=635.64s)]
*  While Trump is the cheerleader for America that gets things done, Biden was the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=637.92s)]
*  ref that blocked teams from any type of advancement. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=641.88s)]
*  He's the one that called the immaculate reception when it should have been an [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=644.84s)]
*  incomplete pass. And every Steeler fan and every Patriots fan, I'm talking to you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=648.24s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qSoo4frd4&t=660.76s)]
