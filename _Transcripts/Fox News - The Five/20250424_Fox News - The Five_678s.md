# BREAK THE WALZ DOWN: Kamala's ex-running mate makes outrageous claim about Trump admin and gulags
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY)
*  All right, Democratic leaders are going all in on suspected MS-13 gang member, three names, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=0.0s)]
*  one man, Kilmar Arbrego Garcia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=6.28s)]
*  Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is throwing his weight around with a possible El Salvador [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  boycott, so much really hurt them, over Garcia's detention, directing Illinois agencies to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=13.92s)]
*  review potentially and potentially cut ties with companies linked to the country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=19.68s)]
*  Not to be outdone, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz used his state address to talk about [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=24.72s)]
*  how Trump is throwing fathers into gulags. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=28.96s)]
*  In this land of the free and home of the brave, we have university students being swept up, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=33.52s)]
*  shoved into unmarked vans, and fathers being tossed into Salvadorian gulags without a hint [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=40.64s)]
*  of due process. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=46.16s)]
*  So I want to be real clear about this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=50.56s)]
*  If you say you love freedom, but you don't believe freedom is for everybody, then the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=51.92s)]
*  thing you love isn't freedom, it's privilege. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=56.48s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=59.8s)]
*  But after that, father, let's examine who this guy is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=60.8s)]
*  DHS sources confirm to Fox that Kilmar Arbrego Garcia was pulled over driving an SUV belonging [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  to a confessed human smuggler and illegal alien. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=72.68s)]
*  Now some Democrats are panicking over the prospect that voters will side against their [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=76.36s)]
*  party for defending Garcia. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  One Democratic consultant saying this to the Hill, people can't afford eggs and you're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=83.76s)]
*  flying to sit with someone who's accused of being in a gang. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  I think it's almost more than accused. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=92.48s)]
*  If you read the police report when he was pulled over originally in 2019, he's with [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=94.48s)]
*  MS-13 members, he profiles that way, even had a rank with it, wearing the paraphernalia. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  They knew he was in a gang then. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, at the very least, doesn't appear to be a good actor. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Just take the word of his wife's court filings. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I guess she's kind of backtracking on that now, but not a good actor. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  The Democratic Party, it is mind blowing to me that they've decided the threat to democracy [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  argument did not work. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=121.08s)]
*  This esoteric high level theoretical argument. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=122.41999999999999s)]
*  You remember Biden and the blood red MAGA speech, you're a clear and present danger [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=125.61999999999999s)]
*  MAGA, democracy is at threat, the core of our republic is at threat. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=129.32s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=133.16s)]
*  So let's pivot to due process for illegal immigrants. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=134.16s)]
*  Not even illegal immigrant children. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=137.48s)]
*  Due process for guys like Kilmar, due process for Khalil, who's not a U.S. citizen. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=139.36s)]
*  This is what they're pivoting to, as if that's going to work. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=145.36s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=148.62s)]
*  The Democratic National Committee is no longer such. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=149.82000000000002s)]
*  It is now the Defending Non-Citizens Committee. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=152.5s)]
*  Change your name, because right now it's malpractice, because you're not the Democratic National [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=155.46s)]
*  Committee, you are defending non-citizens. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  Try defending Americans, like the pro-life prisoners you put in jail. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=161.56s)]
*  William Goodman, who didn't have toilet paper for two weeks, but the trans inmates got makeup, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=165.28000000000003s)]
*  he told me, try defending U.S. citizens and see how that works out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=168.92s)]
*  And there's some Democrats who feel like you feel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  Moa Lethe, you know, worked for Hillary Clinton, came out, said, I'm pretty sure this is dangerous [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=174.55999999999997s)]
*  to make this guy a martyr. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  Henry Cuellar, with all due respect, when you're talking about bringing somebody back, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=180.56s)]
*  and I know that they know needs due process, he was in Maryland, you might want to think [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=184.14s)]
*  twice about getting behind this guy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=189.0s)]
*  And Greg, do you think it really hurts El Salvador knowing that potentially Illinois [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  could cut them off? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=195.6s)]
*  Well, it's scary. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  Pritzker wants to boycott El Salvador, but it's pretty easy when they don't make Twinkies, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=198.2s)]
*  cheesesteaks, and honey-baked hams. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  What else does he buy? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=205.44s)]
*  You know, it would be nice for him to stop boycotting exercise, is what I'm getting at. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=206.44s)]
*  His head is so up his ass, mainly because there's so much room, that he is unaware of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  what he is doing to the party. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  Look, whenever I hear the phrase due process, I kind of zone out, because I'm not a lawyer. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  But I did some research. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=225.16s)]
*  Illegals aren't entitled to a full trial, or even legal counsel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=226.32s)]
*  All they're supposed to do is refute the status that they are illegal. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=231.48s)]
*  So this is an administrative issue, not a legal one. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=235.76s)]
*  And deportation is not a punishment. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=240.44s)]
*  You're not being deprived of liberty or property in a country that you are not entitled to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  be in. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=249.48s)]
*  Plus, if you say, well, you know, well, he was in danger in El Salvador, you haven't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  corroborated or proven that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  You're buying into a narrative based on NGOs that train people to come up with backstories. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=258.28s)]
*  Sometimes these backstories don't come up until they're forced to go. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=266.92s)]
*  They never bring it up before, and then they go, oh, no, wait, I'm claiming asylum because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=270.88s)]
*  I might get killed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=274.44s)]
*  That stuff is coached. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=276.3s)]
*  The courts deemed him MS-13. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=278.76s)]
*  The claims of danger weren't corroborated. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=281.68s)]
*  I think the wife's first husband was frightened that she was dating a gang member. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  So we all know that this is all based on BS. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=290.32s)]
*  And it troubles me that I have to even do this research. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=301.96s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=302.96s)]
*  I have to learn about this so-called model citizen because they keep bringing it up. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=304.44s)]
*  But I guess it's good news. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=310.08s)]
*  Just keep going. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  Keep going after the perps. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=312.78s)]
*  Keep ignoring the victims. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  You don't care about the victims of crime. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  You don't care about the victims on college campuses. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  You don't care about the victims of hate crime hoaxes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, keep going. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=325.12s)]
*  Your party's dead. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=326.29999999999995s)]
*  So Dana, the one thing they're saying is he's in danger from a rival gang. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  Excuse me, did you say rival gang? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=330.64s)]
*  Does that mean you're in a gang? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=332.12s)]
*  So he's worried about getting hurt. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=333.88s)]
*  But just keep in mind, too, it came out a couple of days ago when they pulled him over [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=335.2s)]
*  and said, we're sending you back to El Salvador. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=338.04s)]
*  They said, do you have a fear for your welfare? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=340.28s)]
*  He said no. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=341.64s)]
*  And by the way, he didn't walk back anything to do with his wife. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=342.64s)]
*  His wife wrote in her handwriting, printed out everything she did so she could say whatever [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=344.96s)]
*  she wants now. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=349.68s)]
*  She was beat up. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=350.88s)]
*  And I'm sure there's some pictures of her, sadly, of getting banged up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=351.88s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=355.0s)]
*  Go visit him in prison. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=356.0s)]
*  I think that the Democrats, they just fail to, one, watch and listen. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=357.0s)]
*  We always give them the warnings. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=361.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  Like of what's happening. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  And then you look at the slew of poll numbers that are coming out around the 100 days. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  President Trump's highest numbers, they've come down, all of the numbers have come down [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  just a little bit, but he's still pretty high up there in the polarized nation that we have. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=372.76s)]
*  His highest numbers are on deportations, including after five weeks of talking about Marilyn, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  the good father, Garcia from El Salvador. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=383.76s)]
*  Now I still wake up every day thinking, surely today is the day that we find out that in [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  the middle of the night they grabbed him, they brought him back. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=391.28s)]
*  There's a quick hearing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=394.0s)]
*  And then they send him someplace else because that would end all of this. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=395.0s)]
*  But that that might come, given some hints on that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  The Democrats don't look at the other numbers. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=402.67999999999995s)]
*  President Trump on the economy, he's making bold moves. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=404.84s)]
*  That's not without consequence. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=408.84s)]
*  And so the Republicans are like, yeah, Democrats definitely keep going to El Salvador, definitely [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=409.84s)]
*  keep talking about deportations because those are the numbers that are actually helping [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=415.79999999999995s)]
*  Trump. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=420.9s)]
*  They're not talking about the things that are hurting him because also they have no [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=421.9s)]
*  ideas on those either. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=424.29999999999995s)]
*  Jessica, do you think this is the dry hole we're portraying it as? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=425.46s)]
*  Or do you see some benefit for the Democrats continuing to get behind this guy? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=429.17999999999995s)]
*  Well, there's definitely benefit to it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=433.82s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that I don't think the majority of the emphasis should be on the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=435.97999999999996s)]
*  economy. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=438.85999999999996s)]
*  But if you look at our own latest polling, the Fox poll that came out yesterday, Reuters, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=439.85999999999996s)]
*  you go to Quinnipiac. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=443.41999999999996s)]
*  Now Donald Trump is underwater and immigration, which was his strongest issue. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=444.41999999999996s)]
*  So he's above on the border, right, and deportations. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=448.1s)]
*  But generally speaking on immigration, he's underwater two to one margins in the YouGov [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=451.5s)]
*  poll that Americans think that Albrego Garcia should be brought back here because they're [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=455.18s)]
*  not getting the information. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=460.5s)]
*  No, it's not because they're not getting any information. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=461.5s)]
*  What they were able to do actually is understand contextually what is going on here. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=463.98s)]
*  So if it's not just about Albrego Garcia, it is about question. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=468.74s)]
*  What was the poll question? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=472.74s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=474.14000000000004s)]
*  Now you're a pollster. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=475.14000000000004s)]
*  No, I can't. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=476.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm just saying I guarantee you it was worded in a way to get an intended answer. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=477.18s)]
*  Well, I can guarantee you that our own polling that showed him underwater on immigration [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=480.18s)]
*  was fair and that the American public thinks that his policies are too harsh. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=483.46s)]
*  And whether you think it's Albrego Garcia that's the most important case or you want [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=487.5s)]
*  to talk about the Turkish PhD student in Boston. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=490.7s)]
*  Not him. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=493.34s)]
*  Her. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=494.34s)]
*  Her. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=495.34s)]
*  That was ripped off the street. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=496.34s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=497.34s)]
*  What are the pronouns? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=498.34s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=499.34s)]
*  I do like it though because I know it means that I'm winning and making a compelling [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=500.34s)]
*  argument. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=502.53999999999996s)]
*  But it's about her or Andri, the gay makeup artist. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=506.3s)]
*  It's about the American. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=507.3s)]
*  He's gay. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=508.3s)]
*  I get it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=509.3s)]
*  You always mention that he's gay as if that matters. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=510.3s)]
*  Well, it does matter. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=511.3s)]
*  Can't you be gay and be in a gang? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=512.3000000000001s)]
*  But that's why he got his asylum request approved because he had credible fear for his life. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=513.3000000000001s)]
*  Because they don't like people who are gay there. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=517.46s)]
*  In a gang? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=519.74s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=520.74s)]
*  Andri was not in a gang. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=521.74s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=522.74s)]
*  I'm going back to my initial point. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=523.74s)]
*  None of these stories are real. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=525.94s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=527.86s)]
*  There was an American. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=528.86s)]
*  Can't you say on border security he has 55% approval rating? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=529.86s)]
*  I mean, I think that immigration where it, Brian, I'm not making it up. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=532.1s)]
*  You know what else? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=536.3000000000001s)]
*  Bret Baier had a beautiful graphic. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=537.3000000000001s)]
*  I might frame it on my wall that had the approval ratings for the last six presidents for the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=538.5400000000001s)]
*  first 100 days. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is now the lowest. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=545.3000000000001s)]
*  He beat himself. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=547.1800000000001s)]
*  So he was at 45% in the first 100 days of Trump 1.0 and now he's at 44%. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=548.22s)]
*  His economic ratings have gone down by 20%. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=553.44s)]
*  The American public don't trust him on cost of living, inflation, all the things he was [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=556.26s)]
*  hired to do. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=560.26s)]
*  They know the tariffs are a tax on them. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=561.72s)]
*  The CEOs of Walmart and Target and Home Depot have to go into his office and beg him to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=563.76s)]
*  stop so that the shelves won't be empty. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=568.08s)]
*  There are containers coming from China that can't get here because of these tariffs, 145%. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=571.0s)]
*  Or maybe it's 50%. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=576.0s)]
*  What does this have to do with the Maryland ad? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=577.0s)]
*  It has to do with what Trump is doing. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  And there are all of these GOP appointed judges that are ruling against him saying a path [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=582.0400000000001s)]
*  of perfect lawlessness, brazen example of retaliation. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=586.4s)]
*  For this way, you're just actually undoing your whole point, Jessica. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=590.24s)]
*  Because they are focusing on this guy who basically every day would find out that I [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=594.12s)]
*  don't know how he could be underwater. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  He might be under 50% but he's not underwater on immigration. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  Fine Reuters, you go, Quinnipiac. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=605.3199999999999s)]
*  Just honestly it's fine. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=607.64s)]
*  But he's went in on deportation. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=608.64s)]
*  Oh great. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=609.64s)]
*  You admitted that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=610.64s)]
*  But 2 to 1 that this guy should be returned. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=611.64s)]
*  Listen, you're right. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=613.8399999999999s)]
*  Keep defending a gang banger all you want. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  But you say they should emphasize the economy. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  I understand that you want me to try to unravel everything that I said. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  The economy is what drives people to the polls. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=624.4s)]
*  He now only has a 27% rating with Hispanic voters because he's not focused on the economy [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=626.6s)]
*  and their costs haven't gone down. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=631.24s)]
*  So are you saying he's going to have a hard time being re-elected in 2028? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=632.72s)]
*  Well, he's wearing, Eric Trump is wearing a hat that says Trump 2028 today. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=635.72s)]
*  This is very similar. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=639.48s)]
*  When Ronald Reagan made titanic changes in the economy, initially people panicked. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=641.0799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump and Ross will be easy. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=645.76s)]
*  But he's actually doing just as titanic moves. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=647.96s)]
*  At least he's leading the country. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=650.76s)]
*  Your guy wasn't even present. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=654.04s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=656.64s)]
*  Big beautiful bill is on deck, meanwhile. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=657.64s)]
*  Coming up, pro-Hamas agitators are pitching tents again as Harvard refuses to compromise [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=660.16s)]
*  with President Trump's crackdown on anti-Semitism. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=665.48s)]
*  So glad I didn't go to Yale. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=668.64s)]
*  You won't get it anywhere else. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnBdh4ujZHY&t=675.52s)]
