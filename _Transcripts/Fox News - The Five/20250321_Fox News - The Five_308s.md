# 'SO PETTY': 'The View' triggered by Trump's redecoration of Oval Office
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s)
*  It's liberal freakout Friday the lovely ladies at the view are mad at 47's oval makeover [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=0.0s)]
*  He's like the the interior decorator in chief now [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=6.86s)]
*  I forget the nuclear button. I don't even trust him with the button that gets him a diet coke [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=11.08s)]
*  I didn't he has plans to completely retool the Kennedy Center also. Have you heard that? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Is there no safe place to go anymore with this guy? Yeah, can't even go to the gym a gym. That's good [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=20.2s)]
*  But if a coke button sets her off Joy's head's gonna explode after the Pentagon named the new Boeing fighter jet f [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=28.24s)]
*  47 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=36.04s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld you were saying in the green room that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=38.2s)]
*  Women usually are the ones that do the interior [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=42.48s)]
*  Redecorating and it wasn't really a man's place. Oh god. You nailed it word for word [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=46.16s)]
*  Yeah, but I didn't say I didn't use that I didn't say women [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=52.08s)]
*  Different word does need a makeover. That's why she's jealous. Unfortunately funeral parlors. They're pretty expensive [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=55.68s)]
*  But you know what? It's like you watch the view. It's like you're transported to the past [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=62.16s)]
*  You know like an old beauty parlor where they trade stories that they just read in People magazine or National Enquirer and they have [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=67.52s)]
*  Ladies putting tin foil in their hair and they go I thought my friends would hate Trump [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=75.12s)]
*  But I guess not the view is for people who get their politics from the view [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=79.24s)]
*  And again, like Anna Navarro is like she can't understand why Trump people like Trump [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=85.04s)]
*  She's the neighbor again that's looking over at the pool party next door and what it's saying [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=90.4s)]
*  Why are they having so much fun? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  That doesn't look like fun the heated pool the young energetic bodies the margaritas the hors d'oeuvres [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=97.72s)]
*  meanwhile the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=105.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're having the time of their lives. I think that like miserable people they couldn't identify joy [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=106.84s)]
*  Unless it was a panelist on the view [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=113.28s)]
*  There's so many things for liberals to get mad at [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=115.84s)]
*  To put a coke button in there and you got to choose your battles [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=119.28s)]
*  Good beauty parlor gossip session is so way better than the view these days. It is so boring [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=125.2s)]
*  I mean, they're so predictable. Yeah, so predictable [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  I it used to be you know when Barbara Walters created that sure it used to be that there was some actual [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=134.62s)]
*  Dynamism going on at the table and there were interesting views going back now. It's just like I can't be bothered [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=139.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't know who has the time to watch this show [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  But it's nowhere near as good as gossip at a beauty parlor [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=149.16s)]
*  And I think that do you think Trump is pretty involved in the decorating at the White House Donald Trump? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=152.28s)]
*  Right here, but I want to reveal curtain in front of it [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=164.16s)]
*  Well, you know about the room that's set up next to the Oval Office [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  He's made that his own after Bill Clinton sullied it. Yeah. Yes. He did sully it. Look the man has built an empire [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=168.32s)]
*  I mean he's built hotels around the world and they begrudge him the fact that he wants to move some furniture around in the Oval Office [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=175.2s)]
*  I mean, they're so petty they're so irrelevant, you know, and they talk about decorum in the White House [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=181.88s)]
*  Where was the decorum and where were they when there was cocaine found in the White House? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=187.44s)]
*  Where were they when Jill Biden was conducting cabinet meetings in the White House? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=192.76s)]
*  They were nowhere and and now I mean what about what about the tranny who lifted his or her shirt? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=198.04s)]
*  With the boobs showing at the White House. You didn't hear the ambit whatever, you know [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=204.84s)]
*  You didn't hear that complaining about that and the truth is, you know [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=209.78s)]
*  Your office should reflect who you are my office reflects who I am and it's not a damn business and the same with the president [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=214.6s)]
*  Did you know that he added the gold pieces on the mantle at the Oval Office? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=221.34s)]
*  Yes [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=224.42s)]
*  So yeah, I was looking at the other day and I thought I don't remember seeing those there before and you go back and look [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=224.92s)]
*  At pictures and it was clean but now it has a little bit of it has a Trump flourish [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=230.02s)]
*  Jason chicks love this stuff [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=234.98s)]
*  Why did you just call me Jason, I don't know I was I was I have no idea [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=238.98s)]
*  What's your name again? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=243.38s)]
*  What was up [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=250.7s)]
*  This is ritualistic that the other side just criticizes the other side's decor [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=253.94s)]
*  I got a whole thing. What is nurse chill done with our White House? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=258.58s)]
*  My god, Jacob Schneider from Trump's Robert response team Greg price [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=261.86s)]
*  Jill Biden's Christmas decorations look like what would happen if a group of circus clowns projectile vomited all over the White House [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=266.0s)]
*  Which I guess is a perfect metaphor to sum up the last four years [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=271.72s)]
*  And I'm sure we could the whole point is they all agree with each other [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=274.24s)]
*  I mean, that's the whole point is boring. That is not the point [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=277.38000000000005s)]
*  You're upset that they're criticizing your king and I'm telling you my king your oh [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=282.24s)]
*  President dog [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=289.88000000000005s)]
*  Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIGbsC4S_s&t=295.32000000000005s)]
