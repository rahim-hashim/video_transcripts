# Gutfeld: Trump is ‘radically’ for Main Street, not Wall Street
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo)
*  Another wild ride on the Trump tariff coaster, stocks seeing green, with President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=0.0s)]
*  authorizing a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for the 75 countries that haven't retaliated, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  but across the board 10% still in effect. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=13.84s)]
*  Trump the merciful giving nations a break as he turns the big guns on China, slapping [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=17.12s)]
*  the commies with an increased tariff that is now 125% and says it's based on the lack [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=23.14s)]
*  of respect. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=28.84s)]
*  47 says just be cool. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=29.84s)]
*  Just be cool, it's going to work out. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=32.04s)]
*  Well I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=34.64s)]
*  yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Nothing's over yet but we have a tremendous amount of spirit from other countries, including [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=44.88s)]
*  China. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  China wants to make a deal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  That deal's going to be made with China. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  That deal's going to be made with every one of them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  And they'll be fair deals. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=56.2s)]
*  They just want fair. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=57.2s)]
*  They will be fair deals for everybody. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=59.64s)]
*  The big move wasn't what I did today, the big move was what I did on Liberation Day. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=61.88s)]
*  You have to have flexibility. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  And the White House is telling China and the media they should have read the art of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=68.88s)]
*  deal. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=72.2s)]
*  This was his strategy all along and that, you know, you might even say that he goaded [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  China into a bad position. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=80.2s)]
*  They responded, they have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actors. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=84.6s)]
*  And we are willing to cooperate with our allies and with our trading partners who did not [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=90.08s)]
*  retaliate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=96.44s)]
*  Many of you in the media clearly missed the art of the deal. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=97.44s)]
*  You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved closer to China when in fact [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=105.16s)]
*  we've seen the opposite effect. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=109.16s)]
*  The entire world is calling the United States of America, not China. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=110.78s)]
*  Be cool, Jessica. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=117.02s)]
*  Just be cool. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=118.78s)]
*  Are you cool? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=119.78s)]
*  Not so much. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=120.78s)]
*  No? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=121.78s)]
*  Not cool. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=122.78s)]
*  A little hot. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=123.78s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=124.78s)]
*  Around the table. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=127.56s)]
*  Around the table. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=128.56s)]
*  You're saying that now? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=129.56s)]
*  To be back. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=130.56s)]
*  Good opening line. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=131.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=132.56s)]
*  Trump even admitted that it wasn't the art of the deal or be cool. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=133.56s)]
*  He said he was watching the bond market. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=139.18s)]
*  And that's what decided this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=141.28s)]
*  He had to cave. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=142.68s)]
*  I think CNBC's Steve Leisman, he said he didn't just flinch, he ducked. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=143.68s)]
*  There are trillions still lost. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=148.22s)]
*  And our very own Charlie Gasparino has been on for the last couple of hours saying that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=149.78s)]
*  he wished it weren't so, but that the truth is that the White House capitulated. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=154.1s)]
*  We still have tons of tariffs on, even our closest trading partners. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=159.32s)]
*  They still don't make any sense. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=163.3s)]
*  There's a lack of clarity on the specific numbers for Mexico and Canada. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=165.12s)]
*  What always sticks out to me when we go on this Trumpian merry-go-round is the ritualistic [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=169.9s)]
*  humiliation that he subjects the people who work for him to. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=178.66s)]
*  So Besson says this was the plan all along. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=182.86s)]
*  So you were okay then with being made out to be a complete liar because you've been [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=185.62s)]
*  doing interviews on our network, going on the Sunday show saying absolutely not. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=189.8s)]
*  We're not capitulating on this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=194.76s)]
*  We're not going back on it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=196.62s)]
*  Caroline Levitt's calling fake news, fake news as recently as yesterday. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=197.62s)]
*  Lutnick, he was on with you multiple times, it felt like, or it was the world's longest [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=201.68s)]
*  interview, talking about how this isn't a joke and we'll be a manufacturing economy, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=205.68s)]
*  which we don't even want to be. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=210.24s)]
*  And I'm looking at how we got to this point, and obviously the market had to do it, the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  bond market in particular, once Japan started selling them off. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=218.44s)]
*  Did you know earlier this afternoon that Greek bonds were a safer investment than U.S. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=221.48s)]
*  30 years? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=226.98s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=227.98s)]
*  The Greeks? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=228.98s)]
*  Jessica, you don't even know what you're talking about. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=229.98s)]
*  You don't even know what a bond is. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  Now Judge Jeanine, Jessica keeps on saying that Trump caved. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=233.82s)]
*  How is this a cave if he got 75 nations to get to the negotiating table and redo their [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=237.82s)]
*  tariffs against the United States? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=244.06s)]
*  You want me to answer the question? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  Okay, here's the thing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  China was always the end game. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=249.33999999999997s)]
*  He's doing exactly what he said he would do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=252.28s)]
*  He said there would be short-term pain for long-term gain. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=254.92s)]
*  He literally got everybody in the world to come to the table. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=259.08s)]
*  Or they're trying, they're calling, they're flying in, they're trying to make a deal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=263.6s)]
*  And he sent a message to those countries that were willing to make a deal with the United [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=268.68s)]
*  States, let's do something mutually beneficial for both of us. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=272.46s)]
*  Right now, his timing was right to the edge. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  And it was a business decision to get everyone to the table so everyone can win. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=281.02s)]
*  If there's a standoff, nobody wins. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=285.94s)]
*  But now, this is the biggest win for America because we've got a level playing field. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  We are no longer a doormat for other countries. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=294.46s)]
*  We've got a president who has the capacity, the ability, and the stamina to fight to make [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=298.14s)]
*  sure that we are at least a manufacturing country again. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=304.32s)]
*  You say the United States doesn't want to be a manufacturing country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  We lost 90,000 manufacturing businesses. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=312.36s)]
*  We want to be. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=315.66s)]
*  Why do we have all these vacancies? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=316.66s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=317.66s)]
*  People don't want those jobs. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=318.66s)]
*  I didn't interrupt you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=319.66s)]
*  All right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=320.66s)]
*  What we want is we want everyone who needs us to, number one, be able to rely on us and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=321.66s)]
*  we need to be able to work with them. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  And they will reap benefits by working with us. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=330.8s)]
*  And we can create a group deal around China, whether it's Taiwan, Vietnam, and South Korea, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=333.6s)]
*  and trying to make sure that we get people who want to work with us. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=341.94s)]
*  China can bully us. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=346.54s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=347.54s)]
*  But they need our market and they need our customers. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  And right now, the Dow is dancing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=352.26000000000005s)]
*  The market moved up with incredible velocity and the S&P for the year is down only 7%, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=355.06s)]
*  which is nothing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=361.5s)]
*  All he cared about was a good result and creating a deal and that's what he got. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=363.14s)]
*  Now, Greg, everybody that now is negotiating with the president knows the pain that tariffs [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=368.28s)]
*  can cause their economies. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=373.36s)]
*  So when they're cutting a new deal, Trump can just say, all right, I don't like where [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=375.56s)]
*  this is going. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=380.2s)]
*  Tariffs are going back up. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=381.2s)]
*  Becomes bespoke. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=382.8s)]
*  Tailored. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=383.8s)]
*  Tailored. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=384.8s)]
*  Tariffs. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=385.8s)]
*  I'm very happy for Madagascar. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=386.8s)]
*  I was worried about not getting my vanilla or my clothes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  George is right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=392.08s)]
*  There's two steps here. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=393.08s)]
*  China was isolated. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=394.84s)]
*  All the other countries are coming to the table, done and done. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=396.46s)]
*  If this upsets Democrats, you have then made another odd group that you have sided with. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=399.97999999999996s)]
*  Tesla vandals, migrant gangs, men invading women's spaces, and now communist China. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=406.78s)]
*  It is hysterical to me what Trump forces you to defend. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=413.06s)]
*  If Trump would come out in defense of puppies, the Democrats would fire bomb the pound. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=417.22s)]
*  But anyway, the bigger story, if you look at the stock market, is this flip. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=423.12s)]
*  I remember when the Democrats were the party of Main Street and the Republicans were the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=427.92s)]
*  party of Wall Street. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=432.5s)]
*  Something's happened. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=436.3s)]
*  Have you noticed? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=437.3s)]
*  I think Trump, it's been going on for a while. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=438.3s)]
*  This isn't an anomaly. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=441.26000000000005s)]
*  Trump is radically pathologically Main Street. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=442.98s)]
*  If you step back and you look at the entire package, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=446.18s)]
*  So sealing the border, that's Main Street. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=449.14s)]
*  That ain't Wall Street. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=452.1s)]
*  Deporting criminals, that's Main Street. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=453.22s)]
*  Getting creeps out of women's sports, Main Street. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=456.02s)]
*  Going after fentanyl, you know, Wall Street didn't care about that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=459.74s)]
*  That was hillbilly heroin. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=462.74s)]
*  That's Main Street. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=464.26s)]
*  We all knew somebody who died from that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=465.26s)]
*  And the zebra mussels, the fish, Main Street. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=466.74s)]
*  Trump's radical in the thing that, like, all of these issues rely on the fundamental mechanism [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=472.7s)]
*  of Democrats and Republicans' survival through kicking the can down the road. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=479.86s)]
*  Every single issue, they kick the can down the road because they don't want to engage [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=486.02s)]
*  any risk that would cause them to lose an election. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=490.34s)]
*  He's got midterms in two years. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  He doesn't give two Fs. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=494.8s)]
*  He's doing this. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=496.56s)]
*  You might not see the results of this in three years or four years or ten years. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=497.56s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=501.12s)]
*  It is radical, radical that he is not relying on that survival mechanism, which is kicking [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=502.38s)]
*  the—he's crushing the can. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=508.52s)]
*  He ain't kicking it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=510.32s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=511.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, you've got to look at the elites, all the people screaming about the stock market. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=512.4s)]
*  These were the experts that said two weeks to stop the spread, you know, that the P-tape [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=516.52s)]
*  is real, the laptop is fake, the border's secure, Russian collusion's really happening, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=521.48s)]
*  Joe Biden is fine. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=528.04s)]
*  And then, the worst, when they pretend to have a solution, what is the solution? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=529.92s)]
*  Giant programs, lots of spending, and war. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=533.56s)]
*  Those are their solutions. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=537.4799999999999s)]
*  And he's against it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=538.92s)]
*  He's like—he is perhaps the most radical president we've ever had. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think this is why the Democrats are so confused. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=545.54s)]
*  They're so used to being on the motorcycle wearing the leather jacket. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=548.68s)]
*  Now they're Dean Warmer, you know, with a buzz cut, smoking their pipe going, the world [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=553.04s)]
*  is passing me by. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  Dana, your philosophy this whole time has been, let's just wait and see. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=559.88s)]
*  And I'm still there. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=564.04s)]
*  Taking it day by day. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=565.04s)]
*  I'm still there because in 90 days, the laws of economics are not going to change. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=566.04s)]
*  The laws of economics and the laws of—they're just the laws. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  And that's the way that they are. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  That's the facts. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=575.04s)]
*  And I think the pause was the right decision. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=576.04s)]
*  I think the messaging is a huge shift as well. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=577.96s)]
*  Earlier today, with Maria Bartiromo, CEO of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, said it would be [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  to let Besant, the Treasury secretary, take the lead here and not have so many different [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=586.22s)]
*  voices saying different things, which is interesting because all of those different voices today [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=590.34s)]
*  are claiming that they were right and that they're the genius. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=594.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=597.62s)]
*  So something that, to me, is weird. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=598.62s)]
*  I also think that a lot of the issues that President Trump is doing, it's not just Main [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=600.86s)]
*  Street. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=604.58s)]
*  These are like 90-10 issues. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=605.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=606.58s)]
*  And that 90 percent of the country agrees with him. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=607.58s)]
*  So that encompasses a lot of people on Wall Street as well. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=610.62s)]
*  And you have a ton of people who were saying, excuse me, sir, but I just lost $10,000 of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=614.9s)]
*  my 401k. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=620.02s)]
*  And that matters to them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=621.02s)]
*  And so when he says people are getting yippy, I think that Besant was able to say, sir, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=622.3s)]
*  we need a minute here for us to get this under control and for me to be in the lead. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=627.42s)]
*  To me, Besant taking the mic today was a great thing. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=632.8199999999999s)]
*  I would add one other thing about COVID, and it's gotten swept under the rug, obviously, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=635.8199999999999s)]
*  by China, but also by the Biden administration. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=640.66s)]
*  There is a new report out of the free beacon that there were a few, it was like four or [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=644.18s)]
*  five Americans who came down with COVID in October of 2019. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  And the Biden administration got this report and they buried it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=656.5s)]
*  So if I were Besant or Trump or those guys, if they're coming up with more reasons to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=659.76s)]
*  do the trade war with China, I think uniting the world against China on COVID is a really [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=665.46s)]
*  good one. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=671.58s)]
*  Remind them of what we've all gone through. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=672.58s)]
*  What we're still going through, what the children of this nation are going through, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=673.58s)]
*  especially in this country, because their test scores are way down, they missed all [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=676.4200000000001s)]
*  that school and their maturity is way down. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=680.82s)]
*  Their lives are going to change dramatically because of what they lost, not to mention [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=683.38s)]
*  all the people who lost their loved ones. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=687.82s)]
*  So there is a way to try and get that. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=690.0200000000001s)]
*  But I would just end by saying I think the pause is the right thing to do, but it didn't [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=692.5400000000001s)]
*  even have to get this way. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=697.86s)]
*  It could have been done another way. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=698.86s)]
*  You could do it the hard way or the easy way. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=699.86s)]
*  I think that this was kind of the harder way, but maybe it's genius and everybody can claim [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=701.74s)]
*  that they were right. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's genius. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=707.44s)]
*  Yep. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=708.44s)]
*  I'm with you, Jesse. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9-ZiU6mRo&t=709.44s)]
