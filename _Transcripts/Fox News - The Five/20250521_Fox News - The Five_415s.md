# 'The Five': Trump’s Cabinet faces off against Dems
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI)
*  Democrats in Congress who'd rather grandstand and yell at cabinet members than work with them on getting stuff done for the American people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=0.0s)]
*  RFK Jr. not taking Patty Murray's BS. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  You presided over the destruction of the health of the American people. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=12.24s)]
*  Well, I have to believe that, Mr. Secretary, seriously. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=16.56s)]
*  Our people are now the sickest people in the world because you have not done your job. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=20.04s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=22.28s)]
*  That is an amazing one. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=23.96s)]
*  What have you done about it? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=25.2s)]
*  What have you done about the epidemic of chronic disease? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=26.48s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, what have you done about the epidemic of chronic disease? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  Marco Rubio putting Senator Margaritaville in his place and he didn't stop there. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=35.04s)]
*  I have to tell you directly and personally that I regret voting for you for Secretary of State. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=40.84s)]
*  Your regret for voting for me confirms I'm doing a good job. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=45.72s)]
*  We deported gang members, gang members, including the one that you had a Margarita with. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  And that guy is a human trafficker and that guy is a gang banger. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=52.6s)]
*  And that and the evidence is going to be clear in the days to come. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=59.0s)]
*  Secretary Rubio has the floor. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=61.76s)]
*  Chairman, he can't make unsubstantiated comments like that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=63.2s)]
*  No one's entitled to a student visa. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=66.2s)]
*  You revoked her student visa based on an op-ed which trumps the supreme law of the land, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=67.8s)]
*  which is the Constitution. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=74.32s)]
*  Someone's coming up here to stir up problems on our campus. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=75.44s)]
*  We're going to revoke their visa. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=77.32s)]
*  She didn't do any of that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=78.16s)]
*  You revoked her student visa because she wrote an op-ed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=79.04s)]
*  Would you revoke... [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=82.84s)]
*  We're going to do more. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  All right, Greg, you've been covering this for decades. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=85.64s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  Usually when the cabinet members come in, they get slapped around. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=88.32s)]
*  Now they're just slapping everybody else around. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's funny what changed Marco Rubio? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=93.24s)]
*  It's what makes a great cabinet member is a great boss. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=96.16s)]
*  I mean, you should see my staff. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=100.6s)]
*  Like, it's like compared to Jesse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=102.52s)]
*  Jesse's staff is terrible because he's an absent kind of lethargic, lazy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=104.16s)]
*  But I would love to put my staff up against yours. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  That's not what it sounds like. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=113.24s)]
*  I'm in the office before my staff is. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=114.56s)]
*  You come in. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=117.08s)]
*  It's because you have no life. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=117.72s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=119.2s)]
*  But you know, a great boss says, do the job and I'll have your back. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=120.12s)]
*  And so you look at these guys like Rubio, RFK Jr., or Cash Patel, Holman, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=123.92s)]
*  Lee Zeldin, Hegseth. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=128.56s)]
*  You wish you had one of those in your cabinet. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=130.92s)]
*  You got a murderer's row because you're working for somebody who is clear, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=132.88s)]
*  cogent, and above all, a fighter who will hold your jacket when you're fighting as [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=137.56s)]
*  well and will jump in. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=142.36s)]
*  This is why Biden's guys were envious. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=143.88s)]
*  They're like, why can't I have somebody like that? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=145.64s)]
*  Why couldn't I work for somebody like that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=147.44s)]
*  It's kind of like, who would you rather work for? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  The Oakland Raiders of the 1970s or the Washington Generals of any decade? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=151.4s)]
*  You know, one team says just win, baby. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  And the other one says, like, just show up. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=158.16s)]
*  Do you remember how Anima Mayorkas was? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=160.56s)]
*  How Meek Mayor Pete was? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  How absolutely flaccid the entire cabinet was. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=165.28s)]
*  They reflected the energy and the aimlessness of the guy up top. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=169.28s)]
*  They were just showing up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=173.28s)]
*  It was a flaccid cabinet. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=174.56s)]
*  Yes, a flaccid cabinet. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  No comment. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=178.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=179.64s)]
*  Eric Holder used to do that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=180.88s)]
*  He used to come in and he used to bitch slap people around and people would love [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=182.04s)]
*  it on the left. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=185.28s)]
*  Now there's like eight Eric Holders working for Trump and people are getting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  what's coming. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=190.0s)]
*  Well, and I think with this cabinet specifically this time around, he very [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  much he obviously wants fighters. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=193.88s)]
*  He likes to take it to people, but he wants people are good on TV. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=195.44s)]
*  They know how a soundbite is going to land. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=198.28s)]
*  And he knows with these guys that he's picked and women that they're very [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=200.2s)]
*  comfortable in that role. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=203.24s)]
*  Rubio has been on the other side of this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=204.68s)]
*  He's been the one asking questions. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  So he goes into this with a totally different comfort level, I think. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=208.08s)]
*  And you saw it, like you said, turning things around on people like saying, why [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=211.16s)]
*  are we spending $10 million on circumcisions for men in Mozambique? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  And the people who are pushing him have got to then justify why that would be a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  good expenditure. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  Listen, the man has five jobs now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  I think Brian Kilmeade is the only person who has more jobs than Secretary [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=225.08s)]
*  Rubio. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=227.8s)]
*  So he's good at it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  I think as is Brian, Secretary Kilmeade, if you're nasty. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  So I think that President Trump knew exactly what kind of men and women he was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=235.24s)]
*  picking for this cabinet. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=239.12s)]
*  You remember how these things work? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  No one watches C-SPAN. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=241.72000000000003s)]
*  No one has time to watch three hours of a hearing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=243.12s)]
*  You want to get these spicy exchanges. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  You want to push them out on social media and raise money from it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't seem like the Democrats are doing a very good job with that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=250.84s)]
*  So I wish they wouldn't do that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  I come from and I'm only 55, but I come from a time when these hearings, there [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=256.56s)]
*  might have been a spicy exchange once or twice, but there was something [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=260.44s)]
*  undergirding it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=263.0s)]
*  I had a chance to host my best friend, my best boy, boy guy, guy friend's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=264.08s)]
*  birthday this week. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=268.52s)]
*  His name's Harold Ford III. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=269.35999999999996s)]
*  I call him Hep. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=270.64s)]
*  He turned 10 years old. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=271.32s)]
*  He had 40 of his best friends there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=272.56s)]
*  And I have to tell you the conversation at that birthday party where they were [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  shooting each other with paintballs was more informative than stimulating. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=277.4s)]
*  And some of this craziness you see going back and forth between these people here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  What I don't understand with Democrats, why not ask Secretary Kennedy, why [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=284.28s)]
*  relitigate the stuff that you did during that, during his confirmation? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=288.88s)]
*  And why not ask him how to cut some NIH and cancer research reconcile with your [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=291.96s)]
*  idea to make America healthy again? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=296.4s)]
*  What are you doing in rural and urban communities to help families be able to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=298.28s)]
*  afford healthy foods? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  How is it that you say to schools across the country in the South and the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=303.4s)]
*  Southwest, not Ivy league schools, but schools that are doing really, really [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  critical research, that you're going to cut their funding if you want to make [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=309.64s)]
*  us healthy again. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=312.28s)]
*  He may have good answers, but I never heard him answer, answer these things. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=313.2s)]
*  Why not ask Secretary Rubio when you meet with foreign leaders, are they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=316.2s)]
*  expressing concern about buying our debt in light of where bond yields are in the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=319.32s)]
*  country? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=322.92s)]
*  Mr. President Trump said he would resolve the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=323.8s)]
*  and Russia on day one. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=327.2s)]
*  I get it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=328.56s)]
*  He has him, but where's our progress there? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=329.04s)]
*  And do you really believe that we should accept a plane from Qatar for the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=331.64s)]
*  president of the United States to fly around on? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=334.92s)]
*  I would love to hear Mr. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  Rubio answer those questions as opposed to these silly. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=338.04s)]
*  Again, my 10 year old son and his friends had more stimulating and informative [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=341.44s)]
*  conversation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  I wasn't invited to. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=347.08s)]
*  You were. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  I thought you were there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  You were. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=349.76s)]
*  I thought you were there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=350.08s)]
*  You say you hire me as the clown. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  What about you? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  What do you think of this? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, I'm thinking that Secretary Rubio obviously caused a lot of debate among [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=355.96s)]
*  law lawmakers yesterday on student visas. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=361.32s)]
*  So you would think that would put the fear of God in students. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=364.08s)]
*  However, today there was a graduation at Columbia University where a group of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=367.64s)]
*  students, according to published reports, let's say they burnt their diplomas. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=373.08s)]
*  They chanted out the acting president of Columbia so that the other students there [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  could not enjoy their graduation. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=385.55999999999995s)]
*  And this has been going on for a year. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  Last year's commencement at Columbia was canceled. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=389.76s)]
*  If you burn your diploma, you can just get another one at the registrar's office. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=393.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=396.96s)]
*  I've never burnt mine, so I don't know if there's. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm just wondering. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=399.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=400.23999999999995s)]
*  Cause it's just a symbolic. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=400.4s)]
*  Don't worry, Jesse. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=401.4s)]
*  You don't have to devry. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=402.11999999999995s)]
*  It's online. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=403.52s)]
*  Just bring out a new one. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJqZQVK5XkI&t=405.23999999999995s)]
