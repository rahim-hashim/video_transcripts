# ‘The Five’ break down antisemitic terror attack in Colorado
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ)
*  The FBI immediately labeling it as a targeted terror attack, but some guests on CNN, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a former FBI deputy director, taking issue with that characterization. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=5.9s)]
*  The local authorities are saying one thing, and the FBI is saying something slightly different. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=10.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's never a great start. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=16.84s)]
*  He is really being very, very careful, and I think that's the right approach at this [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  point. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  They don't have a clear idea. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  It makes law enforcement look disorganized, and it makes the FBI look so juvenile. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=29.84s)]
*  Why are you getting ahead of the police chief? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=36.24s)]
*  The guy literally lit a Holocaust survivor on fire, and the media suddenly cares about [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=39.88s)]
*  waiting for more facts while he yelled, free Palestine and more. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=46.22s)]
*  Greg, I was thinking about how you and I have been doing this show for nearly 14 years, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  and the terrorism cases and attacks, they have morphed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  We always worried about this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=59.4s)]
*  What about the attacks from within? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=60.96s)]
*  And now you are seeing this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=63.16s)]
*  There is a pattern, and this is just one more in a horrible set of instances. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=65.08s)]
*  You know what's interesting is there is a pattern that hasn't changed, and it's the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  media's focus on the reaction of the attack and not the attack itself. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=74.12s)]
*  So why would they do that? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=81.52s)]
*  Why is it more important to them to talk about the labeling of this? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=82.52s)]
*  Because they know that they are complicit in what happened before. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=86.44s)]
*  They'd rather not talk about what could have been prevented. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=89.48s)]
*  For example, when you elect a crumbling president, you have a crumbling border. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  That is the best cause and effect you're ever going to see. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=96.52s)]
*  The reason why this guy was able to get in was because Biden was president. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=99.12s)]
*  You don't want to talk about that, because then you're complicit, so you focus on the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=103.16s)]
*  reaction after. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=108.12s)]
*  Did you see what Stephen Miller said? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=110.12s)]
*  Did you see what Donald Trump said? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=112.0s)]
*  If I were to say right now, is there a study, has anybody ever done a study on the most [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=113.68s)]
*  common first name among terrorists? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  It's just a question. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=121.2s)]
*  I bet that will get more coverage than the terrorist attack itself. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  It's always about the reaction. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  What's also incredible to me is how quickly identity politics disappears. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=128.56s)]
*  Suddenly the who or the what about the terrorist becomes the least important factor. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=133.16s)]
*  But if he was up for a job in the faculty lounge of Harvard, it would be front and center. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=139.04s)]
*  But if you live by identity politics, you die by it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=144.28s)]
*  It was identity politics that allowed this fiend to be seen as an aggrieved group, get [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=148.0s)]
*  special dispensation that helped him pave the way to unleash this carnage, because he's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  aggrieved. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=158.92s)]
*  So right now you have a legacy media that is doing nothing but criticizing people for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=159.92s)]
*  calling it what it is, terrorism. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=165.2s)]
*  Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=169.04s)]
*  You won't get it anywhere else. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIG-cn0JLxQ&t=173.95999999999998s)]
