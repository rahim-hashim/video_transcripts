# ‘The Five’: Trump’s tariff mania continues
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY)
*  Don't be a panicking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump coining a new phrase as he sticks to his guns on tariffs, telling Wall [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=2.56s)]
*  Street and regular folks to be strong, courageous, and patient as their 401Ks took a rollercoaster [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=6.0s)]
*  in the stock market, the president promising if you are patient, greatness will be the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=12.44s)]
*  result. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=16.64s)]
*  At the same time, President Trump also says that he could be ready to talk and cut deals [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=17.64s)]
*  with over 180 nations that he tariffed, meeting earlier with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=21.84s)]
*  Netanyahu for his first meeting with a world leader since the tariffs launched. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=26.92s)]
*  It can both be true. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  There can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations because there are things [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  that we need beyond tariffs. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=38.68s)]
*  We're going to get fair deals and good deals with every country and if we don't, we're [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=40.24s)]
*  going to have nothing to do with them. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=44.44s)]
*  They're not going to be allowed to participate in the United States. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=45.72s)]
*  It's the only chance our country will have to reset the table because no other president [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=48.84s)]
*  would be willing to do what I'm doing or to even go through it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=56.76s)]
*  Now, I don't mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  Tariffs will make this country very rich. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=65.12s)]
*  James Trump working overtime to tame the tariff beast with administration officials saying [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=67.8s)]
*  over 50 countries have reached out to make deals. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=71.56s)]
*  More than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=75.2s)]
*  There doesn't have to be a recession. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=78.6s)]
*  Army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=80.68s)]
*  iPhones. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  That kind of thing is going to come to America. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=86.48s)]
*  It's going to be automated and great Americans, the trade craft of America, is going to fix [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=88.28s)]
*  them, is going to work on them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=94.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Democrats busy trying to score some political points, criticizing the president [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=96.0s)]
*  for playing golf as terrorists rocked the stock market. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=100.56s)]
*  Where was Trump when those soldiers were transferred to Dover Air Force Base? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  Trump was at his resort in Miami, Florida. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=107.4s)]
*  He was there to hit the links for the Saudi-backed Live Golf Tournament. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=110.16s)]
*  Is the president out on a golf cart while people's retirement is in flames? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=113.84s)]
*  He spent the day working on his golf swing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=118.64s)]
*  They're experiencing uncertainty, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  And they see the president off golfing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Jesse, one of the things I cannot stand is complaints about golf. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  Me too. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=131.32s)]
*  And that's not a middle finger to middle America. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=132.32s)]
*  That's a middle finger to all these foreign countries who are trying to get on the phone [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=133.88s)]
*  and negotiate these tariffs down. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=137.32s)]
*  But if Biden was golfing during a stock market like this, I'm sure I wouldn't say a word. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=139.74s)]
*  You wouldn't. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=145.46s)]
*  I would not. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=146.46s)]
*  And now I'm not panicking, Dana, because I'm not looking. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=147.46s)]
*  I haven't looked at my bank account. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=151.58s)]
*  I'm afraid. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=153.3s)]
*  But I'm just going to be patient. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=155.66s)]
*  And my people are going to set me up so when this thing rallies, I can say, in your face, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  Harold, and it will rally because it always does. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=162.86s)]
*  Now Besant, the Treasury Secretary, broke the Bank of England. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=166.26s)]
*  That's who I want running this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  He'll probably break the Bank of China. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=171.5s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do here. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=173.82s)]
*  This is a 40-year problem, and we've only been at it for four days. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Take a breath. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=181.38s)]
*  What Lutnick is saying, American workers are not going to be screwing in little schools [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=182.38s)]
*  to iPhones. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  He's saying the future is robotics. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  He's saying the future is AI, automation, and robotics. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  So you're going to have this massive high-tech manufacturing sector that's going to be building [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=193.72s)]
*  cars, airplanes, data centers, and you're going to need American blue collar workers [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=198.12s)]
*  to service these robots, build the robots, and maintain them and operate them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  If we're going to have ships, if we're going to have new weapons for the next century, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=207.44s)]
*  that's the game. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=211.32s)]
*  And if you're saying they're going to pass this tariff onto the customer and they're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=213.5s)]
*  Okay, maybe. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=219.48s)]
*  Or we just got six million new customers all over the world, so we're going to be making [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=221.72s)]
*  so much money selling these things to India and Asia and Europe that we're not going to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=227.72s)]
*  have to raise prices. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, everybody says, oh, you know, we got these flat-screen TVs. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=233.28s)]
*  Got to have our cheap flat-screen TVs. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=237.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  Does the guy really need $50 off a flat screen when his factory left, when he doesn't have [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  a job in fentanyl pouring into the country? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=248.32s)]
*  That's the trade-off we're talking about here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=250.56s)]
*  Now, here's how I feel about this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=252.44s)]
*  Remember in 2022, when they had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, and that's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=255.64s)]
*  technically a recession, and the S&P was down 20% for the year? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=262.56s)]
*  Did anybody panic? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=267.76s)]
*  Were there any panic-ins? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=268.92s)]
*  No, they said Bidenomics was working. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=269.92s)]
*  I don't know if it was or not. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=272.44s)]
*  Well, obviously not. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=274.4s)]
*  And that's the point, because now we have growth in the economy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  We have S&P that's only down 14%, massive amounts of private investments pouring in, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=280.2s)]
*  and we had a massive jobs number to hit in March. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  So everybody stop panicking. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=289.78s)]
*  Relax. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=292.67999999999995s)]
*  I feel like, Harold, you got a lot of notes. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm going to go to you next and give you the floor. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=295.12s)]
*  Wait, first, good to be back. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=298.12s)]
*  It's glad to be back, and good to be back around the table, and hope everybody had a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=299.56s)]
*  good weekend. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=302.88s)]
*  I'd say two things to Jesse. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=303.88s)]
*  I hope you're right, too. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=304.96s)]
*  Me too. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=306.52s)]
*  Thus far, you don't appear to be right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=307.52s)]
*  And I say that for just a couple of objective reasons. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=311.44s)]
*  First, President Trump and I agree on probably a lot of things. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  One thing we agreed on over the last seven, eight years is that every day you get a scorecard [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=319.36s)]
*  about how our economy and how consumers and business leaders feel, business people of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=323.6s)]
*  all sizes, big and small businesses, how they feel about the day, how they feel about what [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=327.8s)]
*  happened that day. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=332.64s)]
*  We generally look to our equity markets to get some sense of that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=333.68s)]
*  We've lost seven trillion dollars in three trading days. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=336.96s)]
*  It was down as much as 10 trillion, up a little bit today as I was on with Dana in the morning, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=340.08s)]
*  and then on the show this morning, and then down as the day went on. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  Two, we have economists at some of the biggest financial institutions in the country have [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=349.8s)]
*  now raised their recession risk, or she said the risk of the country will be plunged into [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=353.84s)]
*  a recession. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=358.44s)]
*  And they all think it's because it's a self-inflicted wound. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=359.44s)]
*  Now let's think about the positive things the president wants to do with what he's doing here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=363.32s)]
*  He wants to bring two things, I think, and sometimes it's unclear what the destination is. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=367.08s)]
*  He sometimes says he wants zero tariffs from all these countries. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=371.56s)]
*  I saw Mr. Navarro on this morning saying even if we get zero tariffs, there are other things [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=375.0s)]
*  we want from the countries as well. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  It's odd to hear that because some of these countries we talk about selling things to, Jesse, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=380.2s)]
*  they're very small countries. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  We've suggested that we want to sell more beef to Honduras. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=385.24s)]
*  Honduras has a $75 billion GDP. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  If they spent all of their GDP on us, it wouldn't make a dent in what we're doing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=391.84s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, I love $75 billion, but when you've lost $7 trillion, it seems to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=396.52s)]
*  me to be a weird trade-off. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=400.76s)]
*  I'm not that great at math, but that's not a winning. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=402.2s)]
*  I think they want to sell it to Australia more than Honduras. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=404.12s)]
*  And it's big, beautiful beef, Farrell. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=406.91999999999996s)]
*  Let's get it right. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=408.4s)]
*  So if you want to go there, I'm happy to go there. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=409.4s)]
*  The reason they don't take our beef and pork, you know what, they don't like the fact that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=411.32s)]
*  they're hormones in it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's an excuse. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  They do it to Europe too. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  Well these are excuses that have been going on for years. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=418.0s)]
*  Throughout our history as a nation, the first 100 years of the United States, we ran a trade [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  deficit. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=429.64s)]
*  You know why? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=430.64s)]
*  Because we were a growing nation, we were a rapidly growing economy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=431.64s)]
*  Economies that are growing run trade deficits, not because they don't make things, but because [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=434.52s)]
*  they're consuming so much of the world's resources. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=438.96s)]
*  The one time in our nation's history where we did not run a deficit was during the Great [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=441.76s)]
*  Depression. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=447.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=448.64s)]
*  Because we were a rapidly growing economy at the time. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=449.68s)]
*  This is just mad. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  Now let's get to the facts. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  The president wants to produce more things in America. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=454.24s)]
*  He wants to reduce the trade deficit with countries. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=456.56s)]
*  And he wants America to be the place where everything is done. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  In order to do that, you have to build factories, you have to train workers, and you have to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  ensure that you have fiscal responsibility. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=467.36s)]
*  The trade tariffs the president's talking about is a small part of it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=470.4s)]
*  He has made it the only part of it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=474.28s)]
*  Where I said last week that I hope and pray that he knows what he's talking about, thus [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=476.52s)]
*  far he doesn't seem to know what he's talking about. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=479.52s)]
*  If this takes six months to a year and we see the kind of continued stress in our economy [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=482.4s)]
*  and our markets, Jesse, it won't be about whether you're panicking or I'm panicking. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=488.68s)]
*  All of our viewers will be panicking because they will see not only that their retirement [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=492.84s)]
*  numbers, their retirement accounts have come down, you'll find young people not being able [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=496.32s)]
*  to find jobs or good paying jobs. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=500.91999999999996s)]
*  You'll see houses not being sold. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=502.64s)]
*  You'll see grocery prices being too high and people not being able to spend in small [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=504.35999999999996s)]
*  businesses. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=507.88s)]
*  This may be funny, but the reality so far is the numbers don't, if this were a Democrat [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=508.88s)]
*  in office, let's say to everyone around this table and people watching who I love the fact [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=513.64s)]
*  that they watch, if this were a Democrat doing this, we would have a very, very different [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=517.6s)]
*  take on this and I would be leading that charge. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=522.38s)]
*  Thus far, this isn't working. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=525.04s)]
*  I want to give it all the time in the world, but at some point when it gets to 10 trillion [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=526.52s)]
*  we've lost in the market and we're trying to make up a few billion in tariffs, someone [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=530.32s)]
*  has to say to the president, this isn't the way to do it, Mr. President. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=534.46s)]
*  I don't think the judge was laughing, she was just going to jump in with a point. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=538.5999999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm trying to be courtesy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  Harold, no one thinks this is funny. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=543.0s)]
*  This is very serious. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=544.8s)]
*  I wasn't trying to say that, Judge. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=545.8s)]
*  I wasn't trying to say that at all. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=546.8s)]
*  You did say it, but let's be real clear about something and that is that Donald Trump, President [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=547.8s)]
*  Trump is doing what presidents have refused to do for the last 40 or 50 years, okay? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=553.2399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is fighting for the middle man in this country. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=558.8s)]
*  He is fighting to make sure that this country has the ability to survive in terms of if [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=562.32s)]
*  there is another catastrophe like COVID, where we don't have to rely on other countries for [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=569.36s)]
*  medication, we don't have to worry about the supply chain, we are in a position where we [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=574.84s)]
*  can take care of ourselves and our strength is maintained within the United States. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=580.12s)]
*  Now, all he is doing is demanding that there is fair trade for Americans. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=585.0s)]
*  I don't want to hear that $29 billion of beef comes from Australia to the United States [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=591.12s)]
*  and we don't even sell a hamburger to Australia. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=599.72s)]
*  I don't want to hear that 94% of the shrimp comes from Southeast Asia and Ecuador that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=603.1600000000001s)]
*  doesn't have anywhere near the protections of their food and that none of our shrimp [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=609.36s)]
*  is going anywhere else. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=615.2s)]
*  I don't want to hear that American businesses are being blocked by other countries that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=616.68s)]
*  get the benefit of blocking us and getting our money. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  So, what we need right now is a president who has the strength, the stamina, taking [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  the fight to other countries. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=631.0s)]
*  We sell zero cars to Japan. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=632.8s)]
*  You look out on this street, you've got Mitsubishis, Hondas, Mazdas, Nissan, Subaru's. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=635.4s)]
*  We don't sell cars in the EU. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't know, last time I saw a Cadillac in the EU, but they've got Mercedes over here [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=643.16s)]
*  and BMWs over here and Volkswagen's over here. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=648.68s)]
*  I'm tired of the inequity and so is he. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=652.4s)]
*  And this is about making sure that we get treated fairly. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=655.44s)]
*  And this idea, how dare he start a trade war? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=659.2s)]
*  He didn't start the war. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=662.8s)]
*  They did. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=664.6s)]
*  And it's time we protected American industry. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=665.6s)]
*  It's time we protected Americans' assets. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=668.4s)]
*  And the consequence in the end is that we will have food that will be safer, it will [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=671.14s)]
*  be American, and we will have industry in this country. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=676.02s)]
*  And by the way, they're coming to the table. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=679.66s)]
*  They're willing to go zero for zero. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=682.1s)]
*  The EU is. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=684.1s)]
*  Right now, Israel is dropping tariffs. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=685.66s)]
*  Right now, he's saying to China, and my money is on President Trump, who got rid of the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=688.18s)]
*  caliphate that everybody bit their nails about, every Democrat for years, he got rid of the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=692.86s)]
*  caliphate in six weeks, but they said it couldn't be done. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=697.42s)]
*  He's saying by the ninth, 50 percent increase. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=700.3399999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=703.9s)]
*  The Americans voted for substantial change and Donald Trump is giving it to them. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=704.9s)]
*  It's called the patience of Greg. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=709.9799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=711.78s)]
*  Sitting there quietly thinking, writing notes. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=712.78s)]
*  What do you want to say? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=715.02s)]
*  Well, it is a different time than the Depression, Harold. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=716.02s)]
*  And what's the difference? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=718.62s)]
*  Cheap labor abroad. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=719.9s)]
*  Just one or two iterations from slave labor. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=721.78s)]
*  But we don't see it, so we don't care. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=724.66s)]
*  We can watch an NBA basketball player talk about the inequalities in our country while [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=726.82s)]
*  he pushes for shoes made by kids in China. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=732.3000000000001s)]
*  We can't even sell these goods at pawn shops. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=736.86s)]
*  They're so bad. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=739.98s)]
*  Have you heard that story? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=740.98s)]
*  No. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=741.98s)]
*  The crap is so crappy. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=742.98s)]
*  They're like, this isn't even American made anymore. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=744.46s)]
*  Yeah, it is down three days. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=746.5400000000001s)]
*  That's a half opinion. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=748.2600000000001s)]
*  Give it time. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=750.4200000000001s)]
*  You elected this guy based on the fact that he's working for you. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=751.4200000000001s)]
*  Why don't you give him the time to work? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=754.38s)]
*  People who panic at the first sign of uncertainty, they're freaking out at the hard part. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=757.26s)]
*  But everything in life that is worth doing always has a hard part. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=763.9s)]
*  Doesn't matter when, that's the mantra for life. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=767.6600000000001s)]
*  Short term pain up front almost guarantees long term benefit and calm after all. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=769.94s)]
*  But it's easy to be brave during the easy part. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=775.24s)]
*  It's better to be brave during the hard part. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  Let's say there's a donut right here, Jesse. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=780.98s)]
*  I want to eat it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=782.98s)]
*  Short term reward, I eat it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=786.7s)]
*  And then what do I feel? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=788.5s)]
*  You'll hear me for the rest of the day. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=789.58s)]
*  I will hate it. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=790.9s)]
*  I will go like, why did I eat that donut? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=792.14s)]
*  But if I don't eat that donut, that means I don't get that short term pleasure. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=794.6800000000001s)]
*  It's short term pain. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  But long term, I'm slimmer. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=799.58s)]
*  I'm beautiful. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=801.02s)]
*  I'm the envy of Harold. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=802.3000000000001s)]
*  So this idea of delayed gratification, short term pain underlies every single thing you [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=804.02s)]
*  do in life. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=810.26s)]
*  Exercise, food, relationships, work, and yes, even trade. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=811.74s)]
*  It's going to hurt a little bit. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprAjUKxlIY&t=817.94s)]
