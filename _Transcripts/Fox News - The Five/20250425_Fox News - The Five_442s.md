# ‘The Five’ breaks down the ‘revolt’ happening in the Democratic Party
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0)
*  Well, it looks like the Democrats are starting with a new approach. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=0.0s)]
*  I think they're calling it the dark woke. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=3.96s)]
*  Joey, does it have your attention? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=6.16s)]
*  The dark woke. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I like that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=8.88s)]
*  You know, how do you do what she's talking about without really forsaking everything [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=9.88s)]
*  that makes you a Democrat in 2025? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=14.68s)]
*  And she talks about retake the flag. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=16.16s)]
*  You told me that that flag is oppressive and a symbolism of slavery and colonization. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=18.2s)]
*  She wants to promote alpha energy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=23.0s)]
*  You spent the last decade talking about toxic masculinity, telling me that that it's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=25.16s)]
*  misogynistic to want little boys to stay little boys. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=29.8s)]
*  You tell me all the time that the patriarchy is written in the Constitution. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=33.4s)]
*  That's why I wore it in my pocket square today because I kind of like it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=36.72s)]
*  What alpha energy are you talking about? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=40.2s)]
*  What American patriotism are you talking about? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=42.08s)]
*  Listen, the truth is we don't think that you are weak and woke. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=44.44s)]
*  We think you promote weak and woke policies. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=49.28s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=52.92s)]
*  It's not about you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=54.16s)]
*  I mean, Tim Walz is an embarrassment to everyone that's ever served. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=55.16s)]
*  Outside of that, it's not about the individuals. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=57.8s)]
*  Some of them have high likeability ratings. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=60.08s)]
*  AOC can go on social media and get a lot of applause. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=62.44s)]
*  But her ideas suck. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=65.48s)]
*  Her ideas on the economy talking about the oligarchy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=67.48s)]
*  Regular people are who I guess you're promoting when you're attacking the oligarchy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=71.4s)]
*  Don't use the word oligarchy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=75.72s)]
*  They say those rich people that are in D.C. and New York, they run everything. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=77.44s)]
*  Maybe use that term instead. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=81.84s)]
*  No, you can't because you represent them in New York, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=82.84s)]
*  And you work in D.C. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=85.92s)]
*  Oh, man. You'll still use oligarchy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, listen, Greg, AOC and Bernie, they are definitely attracting huge crowds wherever they go. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=89.16s)]
*  One of the stops, they actually used a private plane, which was pretty key. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  But anyway, she is definitely getting attention. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=99.08s)]
*  She's evolving in her politics. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=102.12s)]
*  Remember when she was, well, boxed into a corner by Nancy Pelosi. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=104.8s)]
*  You know, I do think Harry Antony is right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=110.16s)]
*  The Democrat Party is revolting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=112.56s)]
*  I got it. I just want to piggyback on what Joey said about Slotkin. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=117.36s)]
*  By the way, she's beautiful. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=121.88s)]
*  I disagree with all of you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=123.88s)]
*  She says in her thing, she's you have to stop indulging the woke, leave the woke behind. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=127.16s)]
*  Why didn't she go first? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=133.44s)]
*  Where was she on the trans issue? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=135.36s)]
*  If you look it up, when the subject comes up, she says, oh, she did the cowards way out. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=137.32s)]
*  She said it's not that big of an issue. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=143.8s)]
*  Oh, it was a big issue. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=145.72s)]
*  Cost you an election. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=147.28s)]
*  Where were you? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=148.68s)]
*  Why didn't you share the risk with other women who felt threatened by strange men in women's spaces? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=149.4s)]
*  It was cowards. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=155.04s)]
*  I actually don't think the woke is as bad as people like Slotkin, because Slotkin and Joe Biden [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=156.28s)]
*  were the ones that let all that stuff in and then hit it under this guise of moderation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=162.88s)]
*  That's what bothers me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=168.96s)]
*  I don't think it's about 2028. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=170.44s)]
*  I think it's about the 2080, the fact that the Democrats always pick a position in which [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  only 20% agree with them and the 80% think they're nuts. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=177.16s)]
*  Rather than doing the hard work, like you say, which is to actually kind of look inward, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=182.04s)]
*  find out what's wrong with your party, they're betting on the 80 going down rather than [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=186.16s)]
*  raising their 20. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=190.72s)]
*  And that could happen. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  Every president has a honeymoon and it changes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=195.4s)]
*  But my guess is you could disagree with Trump on deportation tariffs, but you're still going [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=197.76s)]
*  to vote for him because he's a leader and he's real. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=205.32s)]
*  He's authentic. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=209.2s)]
*  When you look at this other batch of weirdos, would you ever want to spend any time in an [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  elevator with them? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  Like with an Adam Schiff or AOC or the squad, the rest of the squad? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=216.6s)]
*  No, there's no sense of humor. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  You don't even know what they are. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=225.6s)]
*  But with Trump, you know what he is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=227.92s)]
*  And he's a leader who loves America, America first, and you may disagree with little things, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=229.88s)]
*  but it doesn't matter because at least you know where he stands. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=233.76s)]
*  A lot of people think AOC has evolved in her politics. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=236.48s)]
*  Jessamine, is it that we've gotten used to her or she's evolved? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=240.24s)]
*  She's definitely evolved. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=245.16s)]
*  If you listen to her at the DNC, it didn't have any of the usual kind of left-wing populism [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=246.16s)]
*  to it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=251.6s)]
*  She's definitely changed. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=252.6s)]
*  I think she's going to be the 2020 candidate. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=253.6s)]
*  I'm not sure about that, but I think she could definitely own the progressive lane. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=254.6s)]
*  And she's incredibly talented and Republicans admit that all the time and also that she's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  very likable. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=256.52s)]
*  She has some interesting friendships on the Hill that you wouldn't expect with some of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=257.52s)]
*  the most conservative members. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=258.52s)]
*  As far as Alyssa Slockin is concerned, she has delivered the goods. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=259.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=260.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=261.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=262.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=263.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=264.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=265.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=266.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=267.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=268.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=269.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=270.52s)]
*  She was a very good candidate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=271.52s)]
*  She has some interesting friendships on the Hill that you wouldn't expect with some of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=272.52s)]
*  the most conservative members. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=276.68s)]
*  As far as Alyssa Slockin is concerned, she has delivered the goods. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=278.52s)]
*  She won a swing state that Donald Trump also won. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  She has served this country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=286.26s)]
*  She has tested these lines out there campaigning and people, Republicans, Democrats and independents, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=288.2s)]
*  moderates, progressives, all of them have come back and said, we're invested in you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=296.64s)]
*  We think you can represent us well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=300.76000000000005s)]
*  And when you look at how moderates do in elections versus progressives, moderates overperform, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  usually about three and a half points on the Democratic side and progressives usually underperform [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=308.24s)]
*  about five points. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=311.98s)]
*  She wants the Democrats to be talking about the things that are important to Americans. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  And that is right now the economy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=319.1s)]
*  And the economy is in tatters because of this trade war that Donald Trump has kicked off. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=320.68s)]
*  We know his economic rating is down about 20 points. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  His approval in the New Reuters poll, 37 percent, New York Times, Sienna, 42 percent. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=328.0s)]
*  So when she's out there saying, we need to talk about protecting small businesses that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=333.28s)]
*  are getting killed by this trade war with China. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=336.8s)]
*  We need to talk about protecting farmers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=339.6s)]
*  Donald Trump might have to do a carve out for them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=341.36s)]
*  It's going to be so terrible. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=343.6s)]
*  He needs to talk about patriotism. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=344.96s)]
*  That means anyone who wants to serve in this country and is fit to serve, that we welcome [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=347.64s)]
*  that and that I see you look up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=351.48s)]
*  A trans person. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=353.32s)]
*  That perked my ears. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=354.32s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=356.04s)]
*  So are you talking about trans in the military? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  Trans in the military. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=359.16s)]
*  There you go. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=360.16s)]
*  Down the hill. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=361.16s)]

*  Yeah, no, no, no. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=363.16s)]
*  But I like where you're going because that's the next step. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=364.16s)]
*  It's like, OK, then what do you do? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, you mentioned patriotism. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=371.12s)]
*  And what did you mention? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=373.44s)]
*  Trans. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=374.44s)]
*  That's not what Americans think when Americans think patriotism. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=375.44s)]
*  Secretary Hegg sat out there talking about fat people. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=378.88s)]
*  They think all Americans. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=381.8s)]
*  They think all Americans. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=382.8s)]
*  Oh, so that's about fat people. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=383.8s)]
*  But you've got to be fit to serve. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=384.8s)]
*  I'm saying, wasn't my first thought was... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=387.8s)]
*  Shannon. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=390.52000000000004s)]

*  Senator Slotkin, very interesting, a former CIA analyst, and I think she's being very [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  strategic about how she wants to go after this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  They chose her to give the response to the joint address to Congress. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=401.76s)]
*  So clearly many people in the party think that's their lane. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=404.76s)]
*  She has called out AOC. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=407.76s)]
*  She says, I can't be like her. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=409.04s)]
*  I actually have to get stuff done. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  Clearly a swiper. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  She is getting really big crowds. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  It makes you wonder, is this what's leading to the whole David Hogg showdown with the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=415.24s)]
*  chair of the DNC because there are two very different wings and two very different visions [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  about how the party moves forward. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=423.4s)]
*  She didn't stand up for women. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=424.4s)]
*  She's a coward. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=426.0s)]
*  So you guys can paint her as some kind of moderate. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=427.0s)]
*  That ain't a moderate. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=430.36s)]
*  That's a coward. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44tYo4HPx0&t=431.36s)]
