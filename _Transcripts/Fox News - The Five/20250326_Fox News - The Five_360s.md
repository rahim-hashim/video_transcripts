# Watters: I'm not buying this
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg)
*  The Trump administration comes out swinging after liberal Atlantic reporter Jeffrey Goldberg releases what he claims are war plans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats and the media seizing on the new details that show signal messages with updates on timing and weapon systems being used to take out terrorists. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=9.36s)]
*  But the White House and Pete Hegseth hit back hard on what exactly it was that was shared. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=20.16s)]
*  You know who sees war plans? I see them. My job, as it's set atop of that, everybody's seen it now, team update is to provide updates in real time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  General updates in real time, keep everybody informed. That's what I did. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=39.2s)]
*  There was no classified information transmitted. There were no war plans discussed. Why did the Atlantic downgrade their allegation about war plans to attack plans? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  They're now playing word games because they know this was sensationalist spin. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=53.32s)]
*  Do you trust the Secretary of Defense, who was nominated for this role, voted by the United States Senate into this role, who has served in combat, honorably served our nation in uniform? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=57.04s)]
*  Or do you trust Jeffrey Goldberg, who is a registered Democrat and an anti-Trump sensationalist reporter? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=66.52s)]
*  Goldberg, who has been racing from one cable news hit to another, claims the Trump administration is lying. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=73.2s)]
*  What are they arguing that an attack is different than a war? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=80.72000000000001s)]
*  They put operational details of a forthcoming attack on a terrorist organization into Signal, into a Signal chat that included phone numbers that they didn't recognize. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  I don't even understand what that means. They're talking about attacking and killing terrorists using various weapons systems. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  So she's just playing some sort of weird semantic game. I don't understand. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=102.68s)]
*  And Democrats used another hearing on global threats today to attack the White House, showcasing giant printouts of the text chain for maximum effect. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=109.24s)]
*  Liberals said the media also rolling out a new smear against Hegseth. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  I believe this story moved from blunder, which it was for all the last few days, to cover up. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  This is a career ending decision. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  It's likely the biggest national security debacle. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=134.16s)]
*  Sheer unfettered Olympian incompetence. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=137.6s)]
*  He also violated the Don't Be an Idiot Act. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=141.48s)]
*  The Trump administration is both arrogant and incompetent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=144.36s)]
*  That's a toxic combination and American lives are at risk. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=148.84s)]
*  The debate among national security professionals is over whether the secretary was just incompetent or whether he was drunk. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=152.4s)]
*  All right, Jesse, Jeffrey Goldberg, we know, is a Trump hater. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=163.04s)]
*  He peddled the Russia collusion hoax. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=168.76s)]
*  He peddled the suckers and losers idea. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=171.92s)]
*  There were no locations, no routes, no flight path, no sources and methods, no classified information. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  It was a successful mission. No American was hurt. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=181.92s)]
*  What's the hoopla about? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=185.16s)]
*  Well, this is like Trump throws 20 touchdowns in a row and he finally throws a pick six. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=187.28s)]
*  And that's what everybody wants to talk about. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  And the only way you get people to stop talking about it is you throw another touchdown. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=194.68s)]
*  Now, I don't know what that's going to look like, but he's got to throw another touchdown and he's got to throw it fast. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=199.8s)]
*  No one outside of D.C. and in the news business really cares about this story. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=205.28s)]
*  There's no video. There's no sex. There's no fraud. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=209.36s)]
*  No one even knows what a hoofy is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=211.88s)]
*  People know who Bin Laden is. People know what ISIS is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=214.4s)]
*  No one knows what a hoofy is. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=217.68s)]
*  But when you get a situation like this in D.C. where there's classified information, a security breach, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=219.72s)]
*  that's what everybody wants to talk about. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  But remember, Judge, you had two special counsels in the last election on Biden and on Trump, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  mishandling classified information. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=233.24s)]
*  No one cared. No one went to the voting booth on November 5th and said, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=235.36s)]
*  I saw those piles of papers in this garage next to the Corvette or next to the toilet of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  No, it's not a big story. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  If this was an Al Jazeera reporter, they accidentally put on the group text. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=249.16s)]
*  Yeah, but it's Jeffrey Goldberg, who's a real scumbag. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=255.0s)]
*  Biden, if he had put me on a text and it was like Binder and all of his political people, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=258.64s)]
*  I would have stayed on there for four years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=265.68s)]
*  And then October surprise, my book drops, I would have made a fortune. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=268.8s)]
*  But if Austin and Sullivan and some of his top national security people accidentally put me on a group text [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=274.2s)]
*  on Signal and talked about airstrikes in the Mideast, I would ease my way out of that group text, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  talk to Fox lawyer, and I would not say a word. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=288.2s)]
*  I am an American before a news guy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=291.8s)]
*  I don't want to get involved in anything when it comes to national security. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=295.68s)]
*  But this guy did. That's fine. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=298.32s)]
*  Nothing's going to happen, though, because the Republicans control everything in D.C. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=299.68s)]
*  It's not like they're going to prosecute anybody. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  So this is going to go nowhere. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  It always seems to happen to Trump, though, like right out of the gate in the first term. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=308.52s)]
*  Boom, Flynn, toast. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=312.36s)]
*  Now, again, his national security guy caught up in this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=314.24s)]
*  Trump can't have a conversation without getting leaked. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=317.52s)]
*  Remember, he talked to the guy in Mexico, talked to the guy in Australia. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  That leaks. The perfect phone call always leaks. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=323.24s)]
*  But for some reason, Joe Biden went four years and nothing leaked. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=327.44s)]
*  And meanwhile, the guy couldn't talk. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=332.04s)]
*  He couldn't think. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=334.2s)]
*  So all the same people we showed in that montage were covering up for a commander in chief [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=335.68s)]
*  who was a basket case, who let the world blow up. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=340.88s)]
*  And they think this is Watergate. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=344.36s)]
*  I'm not buying it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVDtJPfDDXg&t=347.2s)]
