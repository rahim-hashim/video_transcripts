# Jesse Watters: The country had to be saved from going over a cliff
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA)
*  President Trump answering more questions in say 20 minutes that Joe Biden did in four years and cogently I might add [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=0.0s)]
*  What do you think Dana? What are your thoughts? Well, I think it's smart for him to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=7.48s)]
*  continue talking because [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=11.24s)]
*  This will penetrate it will get through and then [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=14.32s)]
*  Whether however you get your news whether it's here or on your phone or however [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=17.72s)]
*  You're getting it you're going to get this news. And so I think him answering the questions is very good [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=21.32s)]
*  He did say he's willing to negotiate on tariffs [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=25.72s)]
*  I think that there's already starting to happen [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=27.96s)]
*  I just read that Argentina has called and said maybe we'll be the first zero tariff come country [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  So maybe that is happening and I think all of us can hope that I mentioned before I do think that the permanent tax cut [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=35.52s)]
*  Situation is very important. The Senate is going to vote on that this weekend and they need the president's push and he's already putting his shoulder behind [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=43.22s)]
*  It is that what you say in sports, but I would also add this that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=51.08s)]
*  One thing that's frustrating is that Democrats all of a sudden they say they're concerned about the farmers [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  But for the last four years under Biden [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=59.84s)]
*  They approved everything that they wanted to do against farmers all of the regulations all of the fuel costs soil and fertilizer [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=62.2s)]
*  Regulations the waters of the United States in the Clean Air Act [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=69.36s)]
*  They spent nearly two trillion dollars in economic burdens on climate change, which really directly affected farmers [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=72.4s)]
*  I'm I'm concerned about the farmers too, but I was concerned about them then all of a sudden they're concerned about the farmers [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=78.4s)]
*  I don't think that's a constituency that they can get back saying that they're upset about [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=84.16s)]
*  tariffs in the first Trump administration [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  There was a 23 billion dollars of federal taxpayer money had to go to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=90.78s)]
*  Farmers because of tariff policy that took away their markets for the time now. I asked the SBA administrator [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=95.32s)]
*  Could that happen for small businesses as well? Of course, they don't want to have to do that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=101.32s)]
*  Maybe it all works out in the end [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  But for Democrats all of a sudden to skate say that they are concerned about the farmers is a lot to swallow [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=105.92s)]
*  So I didn't just he has Trump has 401k, do you know that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=112.04s)]
*  Yeah, kind of funny the Trump Organization has a very generous benefits package [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  How would you know that? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=123.08s)]
*  You know, it's a great company Greg. Some would say it's the best company around [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  So he basically said every country in the world is called. Yeah, and this is what this is all about. So [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=129.32s)]
*  Why do they have full access to our market and we have limited access to their markets? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  What are we getting out of that? So we have to make sure we get a good return on that luckily energy prices are going down and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=140.0s)]
*  This shouldn't affect food prices because we only import 15% of our food. We're very self-sufficient in food [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=147.6s)]
*  So core inflation food and energy should not go up because of these tariffs and his argument is he's not creating a recession [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=154.1s)]
*  He's saving the country from a recession because of this incredible amount of job loss incredible amount of manufacturing loss over the year [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=161.56s)]
*  And then Biden driving up rates driving up debt [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=169.04s)]
*  The country had to be saved from going over a cliff and this is one of the silver bullets [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=173.0s)]
*  The other one is tax and regulation relief that can't come soon enough [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  Harold did you hear anything just now that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=182.6s)]
*  Made you feel good or positive. I heard him say that he's willing to negotiate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  With other countries he that was a different song they sang yesterday and even some of his advisors today. So that's a positive [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=190.56s)]
*  Hopefully the market will take that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  Second, I still can't quite for the life of me understand how today was a success [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=198.08s)]
*  The president says the tariff operation is over. I hope that is indeed the case because we lost three trillion dollars of value in our own market [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=203.24s)]
*  It's different when you say but when it's different when you say we punish the rest of them and we're now going to negotiate with [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=210.08s)]
*  Them because we want to save them. We punished ourselves in the process three [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=215.02s)]
*  What jobs are we actually trying to get back from these nations? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=219.12s)]
*  You look at the manufacturing supply chains there many of those jobs are lower paying jobs [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  That doesn't mean we don't want them here [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=227.0s)]
*  But I would imagine instead of fighting down or looking backwards [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=228.24s)]
*  We should be fighting to create jobs to help us build and repair the next generation of robots defense [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=231.88s)]
*  Munitions and defense equipment the next generation of pharmaceuticals three [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=237.96s)]
*  We talked you talked a lot on this show Greg and I agree with you and birdbent a tale about too fast moving towards an energy [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=242.9s)]
*  Economy that is too green Democrats want to do it green economy right away and forget oil [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=249.02s)]
*  You can't do the tariff thing the president's doing and this kind of abrupt jolt to our economy and not realize that you're going to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=253.92s)]
*  Impact people and prices negatively coffee prices and food prices did go up to jet today [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=260.96s)]
*  Just so we saw on our network [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=266.1s)]
*  We were interviewing people across the country who were paying more for goods in in different places [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=268.0s)]
*  Finally as I said, I'm rooting for the president this but I remind everyone there were only a handful of countries today [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=272.56s)]
*  Who were not affected by these tariffs and one of them was Russia? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=278.48s)]
*  And the only country that I'm worried about is the United States [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  And I really am not concerned about the other countries the president has always been willing to negotiate [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=286.44s)]
*  That's who he is. It's not like these tariffs were set in stone [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=293.0s)]
*  We knew from the get-go that this was about a negotiation [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=296.48s)]
*  That's number one number two the monies in the stock market are gonna come back. Okay now they always come back [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=300.12s)]
*  Okay, and you know for all those people having a panic attack [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  Don't look for the next few weeks number three when the president started talking about [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  Pharmaceuticals and tariffs it meant just what I was talking about on the first round that we've got to recognize that we have to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=315.36s)]
*  manufacture that stuff here and finally, I think one of the interesting thing that's happening is that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=323.04s)]
*  the American manufacturers [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=329.32s)]
*  General Motors is now hiring more employees to make more trucks. They're now proving overtime [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=332.12s)]
*  This is just within the last few hours and Ford is now telling Americans you want to buy a vehicle [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=338.3s)]
*  We'll give all of you our employee prices. Everybody is a part of this. Everybody's gonna make this happen. Just wait [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3La_X1icDA&t=343.46000000000004s)]
