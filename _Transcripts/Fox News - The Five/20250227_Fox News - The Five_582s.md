# Gutfeld blasts ‘latest unhinged Democrat media attack’ on DOGE
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac)
*  They tried singing, they tried rallies, and now they're trying racism. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=0.0s)]
*  The latest unhinged Democrat media attack on Doge has them questioning the citizenship [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=5.46s)]
*  of America's most prominent African American. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=10.02s)]
*  Which country is he loyalty to? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=14.1s)]
*  South Africa? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=15.66s)]
*  Canada? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=16.66s)]
*  Or the United States? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=17.66s)]
*  I don't want to rely upon the benevolence of an Elon Musk who grew up in apartheid South [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=19.66s)]
*  Africa. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=26.6s)]
*  Go back to South Africa. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=27.6s)]
*  He's not a citizen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=28.6s)]
*  He came here illegally. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=29.6s)]
*  Whose American citizenship is his third choice of citizenship. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=30.76s)]
*  A pro-apartheid South African beginner. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  He was pro-apartheid as I understand it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=39.72s)]
*  This foreigner, foreign agent, you know, an enemy of the United States. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  Now I'm getting some flack because I said that Musk was pro-apartheid. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  I don't really know for sure if he was. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=51.28s)]
*  Sue the heck out of her. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=53.56s)]
*  So they can whine all they want about Doge, but Musk is multiplying. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=55.52s)]
*  President Trump signing an EO directing all federal agencies to have a representative [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=59.88s)]
*  of Doge to oversee all spending. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=63.34s)]
*  And 47 is once again offering his seal of approval. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  We are having great success in slimming down our government. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=70.36s)]
*  It's been really very successful. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=74.28s)]
*  Some took payouts and buyouts and others took other things. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=76.68s)]
*  And some people are finding out don't even exist. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  We're finding that we have a lot of people that don't exist that people thought that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=83.8s)]
*  did. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Jesse, this is kind of amazing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Not surprising, but amazing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=90.2s)]
*  You know, God forbid you say go back to Africa, right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=92.16s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=95.16s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=96.16s)]
*  But you can say go back to Africa. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=97.16s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=98.16s)]
*  You shouldn't say it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=99.16s)]
*  You shouldn't say it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=100.16s)]
*  I would never say it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=101.16s)]
*  Neither would I. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=102.16s)]
*  They keep moving the goalposts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=103.16s)]
*  I need to know what's racist and what not is racist. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=104.16s)]
*  You can say go back to South Africa. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=106.16s)]
*  Just one adjective. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=107.96s)]
*  So I guess the Democrats' immigration policies deport Elon Musk and keep MS-13. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=110.04s)]
*  Liberals look like 16-year-old girls here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=116.12s)]
*  They love Musk because of his cars, but now they hate him because of who he hangs out [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=118.68s)]
*  with. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=123.4s)]
*  Jessica, I have a feeling that when we do colonize Mars, Musk is not planting a South [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=124.4s)]
*  African flag. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=129.24s)]
*  OK? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=130.72s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=131.76s)]
*  Questioning Elon's loyalty to this country after not questioning the thousands of unvetted [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=134.0s)]
*  Chinese Muslims, Venezuelans who lay led into the country is insane. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=140.48s)]
*  They have no message. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=146.32s)]
*  First, Musk was an anti-Semitic gangster. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=147.6s)]
*  Then he was co-president for a long time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=151.2s)]
*  Then he's racist and now he has dual loyalties. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=153.36s)]
*  The Democrats used to have this awesome media machine where they could just destroy you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=157.08s)]
*  with smears and lies. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=162.0s)]
*  And that's broken. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=164.04s)]
*  And it's not working anymore. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=165.3s)]
*  So why don't they just say, you know what, his policies are bad, this is not going to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=166.64s)]
*  be good for the American people, or maybe they can join the cause in getting rid of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=170.28s)]
*  waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=174.8s)]
*  It's silly because this dual loyalty thing is ridiculous since you guys are constantly [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=176.84s)]
*  America last. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=180.72s)]
*  You're always sending billions of dollars to state sponsors of terror. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=182.48s)]
*  You're working with the cartels to invade the country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=186.58s)]
*  The other day you guys were cheering for America to lose to Mexico and Canada. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=189.88s)]
*  I believe that was Crockett not to be confused with Davy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=196.04s)]
*  Or Sonny's partner on Miami Vice. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=202.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=204.48s)]
*  Or is it Sonny Crockett? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=205.48s)]
*  I can't remember, Dana. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=206.48s)]
*  I'm too young for that show. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=207.96s)]
*  You know, what is interesting too is how they didn't feel this way about George Soros, who [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=209.64s)]
*  spent billions and billions to undermine American strength. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=215.92s)]
*  But if you criticize George Soros, you are playing into the tropes of anti-Semitism. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=219.64s)]
*  Not only that, but do you remember that Ilhan Omar caused a multi-week kerfuffle, including [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  a vote for being censored in the House because she suggested the Jewish people in America [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  have dual loyalties. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=235.72s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=236.72s)]
*  She almost got censored, even by Nancy Pelosi. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=237.72s)]
*  That was a huge deal. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Now they're doing the same. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=240.92s)]
*  Also, I think that President Trump is blessed with the dumbest opposition. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=242.92s)]
*  They cannot figure out what their, get their footing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=249.08s)]
*  And part of it is what Jesse said is that their media operation has collapsed. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  But the other thing is Ilhan Musk was bullied terribly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=256.0s)]
*  He was abused terribly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=260.72s)]
*  And he was able to get himself out of that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=263.14s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=265.82s)]
*  This is the other thing that kills me. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=266.82s)]
*  He could live anywhere in the world. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=268.0s)]
*  And he chose us. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=270.62s)]
*  He chose America. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  And this is where he has his companies. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=273.44s)]
*  This is where the innovation is coming from. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=275.12s)]
*  And he single-handedly is going to solve rural broadband because for years, going back for [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=276.64s)]
*  years, they figure out how are we going to connect rural America to the internet? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=283.28s)]
*  And the Biden administration had all this money pledged for it, spend a bunch, never [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=286.84s)]
*  even dropped a cable. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  Now Starlink is going to be able to solve that problem for a much less price. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=293.84s)]
*  So I think that Trump has terrible opposition. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=296.88s)]
*  I do feel what Jesse said. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=300.12s)]
*  I agree with him on the merits. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=303.32s)]
*  But if you look at what he has accomplished and overcome in his life, any of them would [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=304.52s)]
*  be proud of that person if his name wasn't Ilhan Musk. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=308.94s)]
*  Rural broadband. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big issue. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  Is that like the Dixie chicks? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  Very good. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=316.6s)]
*  I like it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=320.08s)]
*  Jessica, I think you might agree with me on this is that it's another example of how identity [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=321.08s)]
*  politics, if it's in your, if you filter everything through it, you end up being a tribalist just [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=326.82s)]
*  like the people you condemn. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=332.8s)]
*  So it's like they just see Musk as South African go back to South Africa. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=334.22s)]
*  I'm not even sure they really do, because this would have come up a lot earlier. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=339.6s)]
*  I feel like it's a moment of grasping at straws to feel fill the TV time. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  And it would be much easier to stick to the merits of the criticisms. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=349.8s)]
*  I think these are exactly the kinds of immigrants that we can all agree that we want to have [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=353.0s)]
*  here to come and build companies, etc. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=357.2s)]
*  You can draw the line at having an unelected billionaire spent what, $290 million on the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=359.32s)]
*  election, playing a pretty significant role in the government. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=365.12s)]
*  And you look at what Doge has done, a lot of it is the smoke and mirrors that he says [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  that he's cutting, that he's not actually. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=374.08s)]
*  But you know, there are thousands of Americans who have lost their jobs, some of them by [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  mistake that he then has to run and try to give them their jobs back. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=379.2s)]
*  You can talk about the support that he's yanking from veterans, everything from staffing at [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=382.1s)]
*  crisis hotlines. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=387.16s)]
*  You can talk about people who protect our parks. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=388.36s)]
*  You can talk about people who run these clinical trials. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=390.96s)]
*  I mean, we are going to be kneecapped in terms of medical innovation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=394.16s)]
*  Wait, you just said he doesn't cut. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=397.76s)]
*  You just start up. He's not. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=399.76s)]
*  It's all smoke and mirrors. He's not cutting anything. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  And then you say, oh, he's cutting all these jobs. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=402.48s)]
*  It's not interesting. You didn't really care about all the people who lost their jobs during [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=405.12s)]
*  Covid, did you, Jessica? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=408.64s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I think I did. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=409.92s)]
*  Roll the tape of her not caring. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=411.32s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't work that well with me because I do have moments of sanity and I am being [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=414.48s)]
*  consistent here in all of this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=418.56s)]
*  But the the American people understand that whether they agree with the larger premise [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=420.4s)]
*  of getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse, that that isn't what's happening here. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=426.76s)]
*  They know what the 1990s looked like. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=430.28s)]
*  They know what happened when we actually worked with Congress over the course of. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=431.96s)]
*  Can you turn? Oh, that just happened. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=436.2s)]
*  Yeah, it did just happen. What are you looking at? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=440.4s)]
*  Charlamagne? She's watching the Breakfast Club. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=442.32s)]
*  Anyway, the 1990s is how you do it, not what Elon Musk is doing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=446.2s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting is that, Judge, you hear from so many people who don't [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=450.2s)]
*  know how businesses work that you have to make big cuts and this happens in every company. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, why didn't they say anything about the 400000 people who lost their jobs when Bill [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=460.11999999999995s)]
*  Clinton was president? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  Why didn't they complain? Yeah, that was in the 90s. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=466.08s)]
*  And why? But they actually went through agency by agency. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  They did it better. I'm sorry. My turn. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=471.92s)]
*  They did it better back then. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=474.2s)]
*  Here's the thing. You've got a congresswoman. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=475.56s)]
*  I've never heard of her before. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=478.2s)]
*  Marcy Capter. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  This is a woman who is questioning Elon Musk, a legal immigrant who followed the rules, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=481.16s)]
*  but she supported 11 million illegals not following the rules, disregarding the laws [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=488.24s)]
*  and coming into the country so we can educate them, medicaid them, house them and make sure [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=495.36s)]
*  that they're happy here. All right. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=500.84s)]
*  I don't know how this woman belongs in Congress. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=502.67999999999995s)]
*  And this whole idea, you know, with Sonny Haas, he's from South Africa. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=505.52s)]
*  What is he supposed to do? Come out of his mother's womb and say, Ma, I don't like it here. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=509.84s)]
*  We got to leave South Africa. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=513.68s)]
*  I mean, this is so stupid. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  It really is. And in the end, you know, the American people, you talk about the American people, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=517.64s)]
*  they absolutely support what Donald Trump is doing through Elon Musk. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=522.12s)]
*  70% of them say he's following through on his promise. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=526.28s)]
*  OK, and George Soros. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=530.32s)]
*  But it's a real poll. It's not AstroTurf like those town halls. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=532.28s)]
*  George Soros. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=535.28s)]
*  No, don't boom about those quote unquote AstroTurf. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=536.16s)]
*  Watch the interview with Mike Johnson last night with Caitlin Collins about these AstroTurf. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=539.32s)]
*  Caitlin Collins. Now there's a good one. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=542.76s)]
*  Isn't that a joke? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=544.72s)]
*  Now, did you notice that the liberals are so clueless that you've got the protesters [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=546.2s)]
*  and the congresspeople in unison saying the same thing? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=552.8s)]
*  I mean, they just must meet at the end of a block somewhere in somebody's house and say, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=557.0s)]
*  we all have to say the same thing and George will give us money and we can all protest [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=561.56s)]
*  and then we'll make sure that Donald Trump never wins again. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=566.12s)]
*  They are so clueless. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=568.88s)]
*  He can't win again. It is done now. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeaK_zHUac&t=570.2s)]
