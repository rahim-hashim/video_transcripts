# 'The Five': Dems won't play nice with ICE
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0)
*  But here's the most important thing, that Democrats like Brad Lander are missing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=0.0s)]
*  According to a new NBC poll, 51% of Americans say that they support Trump's handling of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=4.4s)]
*  immigration and the border. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=10.88s)]
*  49% disagreed. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=13.02s)]
*  And Jessica, you put that on top of DHS, which has confirmed that 75% of ICE arrests in Trump's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=15.52s)]
*  first hundred days were criminals with convictions or pending charges. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=21.92s)]
*  So I think that's reflected in the majority of Americans saying yes and thank you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=27.0s)]
*  Well, yes and thank you would be more than basically 50-50. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=31.16s)]
*  So that's within the margin of error. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=35.6s)]
*  This used to be his best issue, 10 plus points advantage. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  And there are a couple other recent polls where he was minus 6 and minus 11 on immigration. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=40.54s)]
*  In terms of the stat, about 75% have been convicted or pending charges. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=44.96s)]
*  Those pending charges are doing a lot of work. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  And the reverse of it is that 70% of people who have been detained haven't been convicted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=51.84s)]
*  which is the threshold for people getting their due process. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=56.24s)]
*  So there are folks sitting in cells, perhaps waiting for their day in court or if they're [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=58.92s)]
*  lucky enough to be sent to a foreign gulag and they haven't actually been arraigned. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=63.32s)]
*  No one has seen them in a court of law to decide whether or not they actually committed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=68.76s)]
*  these crimes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=73.4s)]
*  What's going on with Brad Lander, who was accompanying a migrant to his immigration [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=75.44s)]
*  And he's done this a few times, is broadly speaking, where the American people are, which [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=80.64s)]
*  is that if somebody is going about this the right way, if they've been in this country [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  and they have not committed a crime, not been convicted of something, that they should be [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=90.84s)]
*  able to stay here or at least to get their due process. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  And I think that the images of the mass agents pulling a candidate for mayor and our comptroller [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=99.04s)]
*  aside are going to be very resonant with folks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  Importantly, Donald Trump's policy on immigration seemed like it was changing a couple days [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=108.56s)]
*  ago. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=113.76s)]
*  Remember when he posted, he said, oh, if people work in agriculture they shouldn't get picked [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=114.76s)]
*  up and if people work at hotels, etc. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=119.4s)]
*  Like he used to employ a lot of people at his properties. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=121.48s)]
*  And it seems like Stephen Miller is back in charge. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=124.4s)]
*  And I think that that's a bad thing for the country and I think it's a bad thing for the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=127.44s)]
*  president's immigration policy because that flies in the face of where public opinion [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=130.28s)]
*  is. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=133.96s)]
*  I don't know why Trump has completely ceded control to Miller in terms of this, but it's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=135.32000000000002s)]
*  not a good look and it's not going to flow well with the governors that run states that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  have a lot of these people that keep them in business, big agriculture states, big states [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  with hotels, leisure, etc. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=150.24s)]
*  But Greg, isn't that the whole point? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=152.84s)]
*  Right now the AG is literally investigating local cops for cooperating with ICE. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  He's probing them and yet it is a felony to obstruct federal proceedings. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=162.32s)]
*  That's what we watched play out with the representing Americans. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=166.92s)]
*  Look, I mean, again, Us Weekly, somebody's arguing with this person. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=169.56s)]
*  Some person's in charge of that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=174.76s)]
*  Look, here's the big problem. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=176.16s)]
*  The Democrats almost single-handedly destroyed the appeal and necessity of legal immigration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=177.92s)]
*  Invading is just easier than waiting in line for a party that claims to love immigration, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=185.4s)]
*  who tells us over and over again, we are a nation of immigrants to no end. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=191.52s)]
*  You just screwed over millions of legal, ideal immigrants, the ones who played by the rules [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=196.16s)]
*  by telling them the process doesn't matter. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=203.08s)]
*  Come along here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  Oh, and then you demand empathy from us? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  Where was the empathy for the missing, exploited children? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  Where was the empathy for the victims of illegal criminals? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=214.84s)]
*  Where was the empathy for the cities that were burdened by all these people? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=218.16s)]
*  We were paying for their hotel rooms. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=221.6s)]
*  You have, there's not a single media hack or Democrat that can demand any kind of empathy [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=223.52s)]
*  from us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=230.56s)]
*  It's over. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=231.64s)]
*  Now the adults are in charge. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=232.64s)]
*  You guys made this mess. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=234.56s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=235.88s)]
*  It kills me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=236.88s)]
*  You guys created this mess, Democrats, and there's a guy that's trying to correct it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=238.24s)]
*  And what do you do? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=242.72s)]
*  You sue him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=243.72s)]
*  It reminds me of like, you know, when a guy performs CPR on a crash victim and saves her [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=245.28s)]
*  life and she sues him for cracking her rib, they don't want to be saved. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=250.76s)]
*  I want to know why you are stopping this process. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=256.72s)]
*  It's not about the process. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=261.22s)]
*  You are using the process as a way to prevent the goal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=263.04s)]
*  If you believe that we should have a border, then you should be supporting the process, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=268.48s)]
*  but you don't really want a border. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=272.86s)]
*  Kayleigh, the LA mayor said it's uncertainty in our city now about this, but what about [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=275.0s)]
*  the uncertainty of all of those illegal immigrants that have been accused of crimes and convicted [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=278.84s)]
*  of crimes and the money going toward them set of vets? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=283.48s)]
*  I mean, that's uncertainty. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=285.84s)]
*  That's destability. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=287.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=288.4s)]
*  And the mayor should take a page from President Trump because she's lost the American public [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=289.4s)]
*  on this issue. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=292.42s)]
*  I mean, Jessica, you bring up the polling a lot on immigration and I noticed you dismissed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=293.42s)]
*  the NBC poll as within the margin of error, but the fact is President Trump has majority [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=298.16s)]
*  approval on immigration in the NBC poll. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=302.22s)]
*  I will take that over the lowest approval rating since Jimmy Carter, which is what [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=304.98s)]
*  President Biden had. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=308.94000000000005s)]
*  Democrats have lost the American public. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=311.1s)]
*  They are hapless. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=312.38000000000005s)]
*  They're flailing around. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=313.38000000000005s)]
*  They don't know what to do. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=314.38000000000005s)]
*  So what are they doing? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=315.38000000000005s)]
*  Stunts. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=316.38000000000005s)]
*  This Brad Lander guy, I consider myself a student of politics. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=317.38000000000005s)]
*  I didn't know Brad Lander, but he got camera time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  Then you go to Alex Padilla. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=321.74s)]
*  He's a sitting senator. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=322.98s)]
*  Yes, but very few people knew him. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=323.98s)]
*  He wasn't like a Kamala Harris or someone with a ton of notoriety, but he gets camera [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=325.5s)]
*  time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=329.06s)]
*  And then you bring in the Congress men and women in Newark who stormed the detention [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=330.06s)]
*  facility. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=333.74s)]
*  Again, their names evade me. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=334.74s)]
*  It was all about camera time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=335.74s)]
*  Then you get to the guy with the impeachment with the floppy hair who had the animal rights [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=336.74s)]
*  problems in his background. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=339.98s)]
*  Don't remember that guy's name. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=341.74s)]
*  They're all performing stunts. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=343.22s)]
*  They all want to be the face of the resistance. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=344.76s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=346.54s)]
*  Trump has majority approval and yes, put Stephen Miller in charge because he got you majority [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=347.7s)]
*  approval on one of the top issues to the American people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=351.86s)]
*  Jesse, what do you think? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=354.5s)]
*  Well, we took a poll in November and 160 million people said the Democrats are crazy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=355.82s)]
*  That's a pretty accurate poll. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=361.98s)]
*  I mean, you seem to know a lot about public opinion, Jessica, but you just got shellacked. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=362.98s)]
*  The point Greg made is perfect. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=367.66s)]
*  We're not listening to you anymore on illegal immigration. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=370.74s)]
*  I love you, Jessica, with all of my heart, but we don't even care what you say anymore. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=374.3s)]
*  It doesn't even matter. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=379.34s)]
*  That's how this relationship really works. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=380.34s)]
*  You came in and you wrecked our house and we're trying to clean it up. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=382.58s)]
*  Not only are you not helping clean this up, but you're criticizing the way we're doing [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=387.5s)]
*  it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=391.98s)]
*  No, if you really cared about getting the illegals out, especially the criminals, you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=392.98s)]
*  always talk about the criminals, then every time we call a nice detention center in LA [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=395.98s)]
*  County, can we pick up this bad hombre? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La4MYsujdV0&t=400.58s)]
