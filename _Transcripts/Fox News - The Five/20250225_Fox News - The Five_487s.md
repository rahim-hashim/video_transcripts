# Gutfeld: Democratic Party has 'no spontaneity'
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08)
*  disturbing and dangerous doxing that could put the lives of ICE agents at risk. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=0.0s)]
*  Flyers are popping up across Los Angeles, posting the names, photos and phone numbers of agents [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=4.0s)]
*  who are working in the area. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=8.88s)]
*  Activists also interfering with operations by using bull horns to warn potential targets [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=10.56s)]
*  of ICE's presence during raids. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=15.88s)]
*  Also not helping the Democrats who are saying stuff like this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=18.0s)]
*  If you look at the food that's on your table, think about who picked it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=22.72s)]
*  If you look at your homes, think about who built them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=27.0s)]
*  If you look at your vulnerable elders and your kids, think about who's taking care of them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=30.2s)]
*  What do you think of that, Greg? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=35.0s)]
*  Let me think. They have flyers popping all over. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=36.84s)]
*  They all look well produced, much like the signs that were behind Pramila while she was talking. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=39.92s)]
*  You've got bull horns. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=45.32s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=47.56s)]
*  These groups are so spontaneous. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  How are they able to pull this off? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Follow the money. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  None of this is spontaneous. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=54.56s)]
*  So this is my theory. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=56.28s)]
*  We're seeing perhaps the biggest difference between the Trump phenomenon [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=58.2s)]
*  and the current state of the Democratic, liberal, political world. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  One is spontaneous, operating in the moment, and the other one is manufactured and choreographed, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=67.04s)]
*  like a boy band's dance routine. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=72.84s)]
*  In this spontaneous moment, like when you see Trump doing stuff or talking or Elon Musk, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=75.36s)]
*  it's nearly impossible to be deceptive. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, we know this when we're doing the show. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=82.48s)]
*  All of a sudden, when you go off the cuff, everything out of your mouth is what you feel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=84.2s)]
*  It's just like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=88.52s)]
*  But if you have to read something off the teleprompter, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=90.0s)]
*  chances are you're lying through your teeth, Jesse. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=91.88s)]
*  But you can't be fake if it's happening in real time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=94.44s)]
*  The Democratic Party has no spontaneity. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  And think about it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=101.4s)]
*  How could they the last four years? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=102.92s)]
*  The Biden White House was the opposite of spontaneous. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=105.6s)]
*  You couldn't be spontaneous with him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  You had to move him around like he was a wax figure and make sure and you had to have everything planned out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=110.84s)]
*  So that's how the party is now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=117.72s)]
*  We are living in a time where one side is completely spontaneous and the other side is just a kind of like a deceptively designed machine [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=119.64s)]
*  that is trying to match their assumptions with hoaxes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=128.16s)]
*  This is why when you see these protests or these town halls, the loudest voices are the activists [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  because they are there to push this lie. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=140.08s)]
*  Normal people, they don't feel that strongly about, you know, trying to preserve corruption. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=142.96s)]
*  Judge, what kind of laws are they breaking by one, alerting them or putting up these flyers or doxing the agents? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=148.08s)]
*  Yeah, before and I have the statues, but I think the most important thing that that people need to understand is that these activists are not civil rights activists. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=156.0s)]
*  They are nothing more than a pawn in the cartel's game to destroy this country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=166.84s)]
*  And, you know, if that isn't enough to convince you not to do it, how about the statute 18 USC 119, 18 USC 114 makes it very clear that restricted [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=172.36s)]
*  personnel's information and doxing of that individual, whether by home address, mobile phone number, personal email, anything like that, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=183.4s)]
*  being released with the intent and knowledge that that restricted personal information will be used to threaten, intimidate or incite the commission of violence [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=192.6s)]
*  or a member on that person or a member of his family is not only a crime of which they can be fined, but they can serve five years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  All right. And the statute makes it very clear under a recent case called People Against Banhoff that ICE agents are specifically covered. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  So the Department of Justice has got a number one, find out and prosecute these people because they are the ones who are causing the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=221.88s)]
*  terrorization of American citizens and of federal employees who are should be protected when they're performing official duties. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=231.2s)]
*  So that would be done by a U.S. attorney appointed by President Trump, not by the local. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=239.2s)]
*  No, these are federal statutes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=244.32s)]
*  Good. Yeah. Good. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=245.8s)]
*  Jesse, the other thing is Tom Homan reported that ICE arrested nearly 90 illegals during this raid in Liberty County, Texas, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=246.84s)]
*  and it included the arrest of multiple child sex predators and murderers. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=254.12s)]
*  Why would you want them to say? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=259.04s)]
*  No, I can't believe people are protesting this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=260.4s)]
*  And I would throw the book at these people. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=262.88s)]
*  If you're telling someone where an ICE agent lives, you know who his wife looks like, you know, where his children go to school, the cartels are going to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=264.96s)]
*  take that information and they're going to use it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=273.24s)]
*  So these people, to me, this is not a protest. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=276.16s)]
*  This is endangering the lives of law enforcement officers. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm with the judge. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=282.24s)]
*  I'm also with Greg. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=283.56s)]
*  It's again, such a brilliant point. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=287.12s)]
*  Such a shockingly brilliant point. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=287.72s)]
*  When you talk about the left and the right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=290.24s)]
*  So the left is all top down command and control. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=292.12s)]
*  They get talking points and everybody sticks to the script. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=295.12s)]
*  That's why when they talk, they don't sound spontaneous. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  They're just regurgitating talking points. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  It looks inauthentic and it turns people off. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=304.64s)]
*  Now, the right, no one tells you what to say. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=307.56s)]
*  No one tells me what to say. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=309.68s)]
*  No one on podcasts on the radio. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  Everyone's independently minded. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  So that attracts people because it's authentic and it galvanizes the grassroots. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=315.56s)]
*  It's like in the Ukraine War. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=320.32s)]
*  That's why the Ukrainians did so well initially, because each of those platoon commanders were able to make their own decisions in the battlefield. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=322.28s)]
*  Whereas the Russians, they didn't do anything until some guy in Moscow, some general told them what to do. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=329.4s)]
*  That's how it happens in war. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  Same thing with information warfare. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=337.96s)]
*  Harold, is this another area where a Democrat could say, wait, this is wrong? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  What's happening in Los Angeles? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  Like you could you could feel compassion for people that are in a different situation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  But murderers and sex workers? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=350.32s)]
*  Anybody breaking the law in this regard should go to jail. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  I think the statute that the judge referenced, 18 USC 119 and 114, they should be enforced. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=353.96s)]
*  And I'm always a believer that when you endanger a public official and you think about the sensitive work these people are doing, there's no excuse. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  Second, Congress and the Senate right now are debating. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=370.56s)]
*  The Republicans are about giving Mr. Holman all the money that he's requesting. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=373.2s)]
*  Republicans are going to have a big vote on that floor tonight. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  We'll see what happens. The Senate thinks about it differently. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=378.96s)]
*  I'm hopeful they're able to come together quickly because the money is needed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=381.76s)]
*  President, I agree with him and I agree with I've said that Tom Holman sometimes looks like Clint Eastwood, but I agree with what he's trying to do. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=384.56s)]
*  He needs the resources to do it. Finally, hopefully come to this issue at some point. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=390.12s)]
*  I'm not sure how I feel and we can have a debate about it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=393.44s)]
*  But whether you give rich people gold cards and you give other people green cards, I'm just not sure I like that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=395.96s)]
*  There are a lot of poor people, a lot of working people who came here from other countries who turned out to kick butt and make our country a better place. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=402.48s)]
*  I just don't know if I want to give it to a bunch of entitled people, gold cards, to come into the country. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=407.96s)]
*  But that's for another day. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  It requires that they invest in this country. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's the difference. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  They still shouldn't get it. I'm still not sure they should get an advantage. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  That's how you go and live in Europe. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm still not sure you should get the advantage. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=421.24s)]
*  That's what European countries require. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=422.4s)]
*  Well, somebody wants to come here and work their tail off and play by the rules too should have an opportunity. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=423.64s)]
*  If you come here legally, I have no problem. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  But if you're not invited and you come here, you don't deserve to be here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=430.56s)]
*  So if rich people who are not citizens want to come and invest, you're OK with that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=433.56s)]
*  But if they want to put that kind of money in the country and risk it, then they can come here. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=436.68s)]
*  So the answer to my question is yes. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=442.16s)]
*  I disagree with you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9EkCumc08&t=443.48s)]
