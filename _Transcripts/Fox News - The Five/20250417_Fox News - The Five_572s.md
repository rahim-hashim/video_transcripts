*  tariffs but Trump's still open to a deal they have reached out a number of times [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=69.2s)]
*  you give us a sense of how far along these negotiations are with China in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=76.12s)]
*  the early stages or are you inching closer now to actually making a deal on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=79.56s)]
*  tariffs I think that we will make a deal with China I think we've had some very [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=83.2s)]
*  good talks but we will have some very good talks remaining and you know I view [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=87.2s)]

*  it but every negotiation requires directing the attention to you and there [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=101.8s)]
*  was no attention paid to this this issue until they made this audacious move at [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  the beginning you have to start the process now you see the process unfold [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=112.4s)]
*  am I right where were you when my contract was up I was trying to get you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=115.96000000000001s)]

*  guy who broke China now the question is what kind of collateral damage is that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=135.68s)]
*  gonna cause are we gonna be able to re-industrialize at the same time as we [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=140.32s)]
*  collapse the Chinese system I don't know he's got to stick the landing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=145.48s)]
*  perfectly we have to get deals with Mexico and Canada that is the most [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=149.56s)]
*  important and I'm sure we'll get a deal with the Europeans the Europeans need [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=153.16s)]
*  our energy we need to sell them cars we're gonna have them drop their tariffs [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=158.12s)]
*  but mostly we need them for basing they're basically one big beautiful [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=162.28s)]
*  military base and we get it cheap especially Italy you project power [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=166.83999999999997s)]
*  throughout the Mediterranean the Mideast North Africa you need it in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=171.6s)]
*  Poland you need it in Great Britain and we love those Nordics yes we do we love [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=176.76s)]
*  those Nordics especially as global warming picks up and we're gonna play [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=180.6s)]
*  some games in the Arctic I see this going well and again I have not looked [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=183.84s)]
*  at my investment account good for you Jesse and that's probably a smart move [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  for your mental health you know Harold we talked a lot about equality and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=193.12s)]
*  equity you're an outspoken defender of such concepts and yet you find that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=196.6s)]
*  trade equality is not a worthy topic you know you call it a trade war but isn't [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=202.04s)]
*  it just trade equality one country wanting to be treated the same way but [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  they treat other countries why are you a trade racist I mean what a loaded [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=212.84s)]
*  question from my dear father so a couple of things this approach I think the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  president hopes will yield more jobs being here in America manufacturing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=223.88s)]
*  jobs he hopes that we're going to have a better and trade or playing field it was [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=228.4s)]
*  with our trading partners around the globe and he wants to try to reduce the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=233.96s)]
*  world's dependence on China now I think all of those goals are laudable goals [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=239.28s)]
*  but the problem is I don't know which one is first second or third what I do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=243.56s)]
*  know is this whatever his goals are since April since April 2nd the stock [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=248.64s)]
*  market which at the time was about a 51 trillion dollar market cap meaning all [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=255.16s)]
*  the take all the public companies in Nasdaq New York Stock Exchange add them [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=259.64s)]
*  all up there 51 trillion dollars we've lost 11 trillion dollar sentence so [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=262.8s)]
*  we're not about we're not a 51 trillion was at 62 before that's number one [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  people want to break China not break them but reduce their I think you said [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=271.12s)]
*  it well Jesse reduce our dependence on them and their role in the global [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=275.08s)]
*  economy but if we break ourselves in the process it's not it's not necessarily [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  the best thing when you think about the 11 trillion that had that been lost [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=282.88s)]
*  Greg that money didn't go into the bank accounts of veterans retirees working [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=286.64s)]
*  people teachers the very people that put the president in office working-class [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=290.76s)]
*  union families across the country in fact these people are hurting the most [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=294.32s)]
*  so I want trade equality but I got to tell you I just don't understand why [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=299.76s)]
*  trying to get a few billion dollars in tariffs from Honduras Vietnam and Canada [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=304.48s)]
*  is worth an 11 trillion dollar loss of market cap which our dollars and cents [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=308.04s)]
*  lost out of 401ks and retirement accounts and aspirations for families all [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  across our country at some point the president will have to answer this and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=317.88s)]
*  again this is why I started the first segment off like I did come back from [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=321.0s)]
*  El Salvador Democrats and focus on the needs aspirations and concerns of the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=324.6s)]
*  American people half half the country doesn't have any money any investments [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=330.28s)]
*  in stock it's like 10% owns 88% and also you when you talk about the loss you act [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=335.55999999999995s)]
*  like you're like a weatherman who says oh it's 12 degrees outside it's never [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=340.52s)]
*  going to go back up it always goes back up in 20 times it's dropped it comes [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  back up and I don't even work at the Fox Business Channel Harold but I tell you [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=350.67999999999995s)]
*  this no one in their right mind ever says you know what the best way to get [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=354.55999999999995s)]
*  from 50 to 80 is to go to 20 then let's try to get to 80 yeah unless you have a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=358.28s)]
*  plan that's my only point I don't think the president had well unless you're [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=362.28s)]
*  a hedge fund well his plan his plan is not clear to me it does it I don't think [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=364.67999999999995s)]
*  and not only that the people who are losing who wake up every day some people [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  are looking at their 401ks because they have to and 170 million Americans are [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=372.32s)]
*  invested in all right Kennedy hi Greg good to see you I wish I had Jesse's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=375.76s)]
*  money so I didn't have to look at my 401k that would be amazing I think it's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  really interesting because you know I don't agree that you are just going to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=385.6s)]
*  cleave the world into two halves like the China half and the US half because [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  China can manufacture a lot and Americans have benefited from that in a [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=393.68s)]
*  lot of ways because we love cheap crap yeah may buy slave labor well I mean [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=397.32000000000005s)]
*  Greg you know if we're splitting hairs here which I don't think we necessarily [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  have to but you know that's that's what you find on Amazon and it's sheen it's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=404.8s)]
*  cheap it's plentiful and that's what American consumers have gotten used to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=411.24s)]
*  so trying to make stuff America consume stuff that is much more useful and that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=415.48s)]
*  is where the president is right because we have something that everybody wants [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=421.16s)]
*  we have buyers we have the younger generation of workers who were set to be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  more wealthy than the generations three generations ahead of them because of [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=430.44s)]
*  their new saving patterns and the way they're spending money and you know the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=436.24s)]
*  the trajectory of their lifetime finances that's what people want they [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  want to be able to sell stuff here so the hope is that if we do move the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=445.0s)]
*  manufacturing part out of China and we offload it to Vietnam and Honduras and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=450.44s)]
*  Canada and wherever else then we won't need China for anything and they will be [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=456.04s)]
*  completely dependent on our consumers and that is what will give the United [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=460.88s)]
*  States the leverage the question is whether or not this country and our [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=465.6s)]
*  consumers have the backbone to wait that long. She's a brainy broad Dana that was [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=470.08s)]
*  like there was new stuff that she said that I didn't even think about. Well [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=474.0s)]
*  China isn't waiting either right so they're going around saying oh you know [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=477.32s)]
*  what we can give you this deal or that deal and using their might and they have [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=481.0s)]
*  a say because they have some power. I do think their economy it just based on [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=484.72s)]
*  reading is weaker than they try to make out they've got a lot of problems we've [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=488.6s)]
*  talked about them especially demographically but there are two clocks [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=494.64s)]
*  there's our clock and their clock and they're moving along at a pace that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=497.52s)]
*  their clock might be a little faster than ours. Maloney is an interesting [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=502.44s)]
*  person to come to America first because she are her country has already gone [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=506.6s)]
*  through a kind of a populous stage anyway so she was the winner of that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=512.16s)]
*  contest they're very upset about immigration there she's trying to fix [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQKIoDTfOjs&t=516.04s)]
