# 'The Five': Hamas thinks itâ€™s dealing with Joe Biden
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g)
*  President Trump promising to let all hell break loose if Hamas terrorists don't release all Israeli hostages by noon this Saturday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=0.0s)]
*  He doubled down on his promise while hanging with the King of Jordan. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=7.08s)]
*  I don't think they're going to make the deadline personally. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=11.8s)]
*  I think they they want to play tough guy, but we'll see how tough they are. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  A bully is the weakest person and their bullies. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=19.12s)]
*  Hamas is bullies. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  You said all hell will break out if all the hostages are not released on Saturday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=24.6s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=28.44s)]
*  I've looked at what at the condition of people coming out of the hostage situation and it's horrible. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=29.52s)]
*  I don't want to do two and then we do another two in another week and then we do four and three weeks now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=37.2s)]
*  They either have them out by Saturday at 12 o'clock or all bets are off. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=43.92s)]
*  All bets are off. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=50.28s)]
*  Trump also giving more details on his Gaza plaza plan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=51.84s)]
*  We're not going to buy anything. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  We're going to have it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=57.96s)]
*  We're going to keep it and we're going to make sure that there's going to be peace and there's not going to be any problem and nobody's going to question it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=59.04s)]
*  And we're going to run it very properly and eventually we'll have economic development at a very large scale, maybe the largest scale on that site. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=66.32s)]
*  And we'll have lots of good things built there, including hotels and office buildings and housing and other things. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=75.72s)]
*  And we'll make that site into what it should be. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=82.72s)]
*  You know, Judge, I'm glad he brought up the condition of the hostages because we keep hearing this like almost equating these sides. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=85.92s)]
*  This is like, I mean, they look like they are survivors of the Holocaust. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=95.92s)]
*  And it's like, you know, there should be no F's given, you know, when dealing with these guys, these animals. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=99.88s)]
*  You know, if you know anything about Donald Trump, you know that when he saw that, that that really infuriated him. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  And if you recall, it was during his first administration that he heard about chemical weapons being used against kids in Syria. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=114.84s)]
*  And he had I think was the mother of all bombs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure, but he did this strategic strike at the chemical weapons factories in Syria in and out because he didn't like what was happening to kids. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  The same thing with these Holocaust looking survivors, who I understand Greg were force fed the last week before they were being released. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=132.36s)]
*  And what we've got to understand is that we have given hundreds of prisoners back to the Gaza or the Palestinians. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, these are prisoners versus a hostage who hasn't done anything. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, the terrorists now they're saying, you know, that Israel isn't living up to its end of the deal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  They think they're dealing with Joe Biden. They are not dealing with Joe Biden. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=158.8s)]
*  They're dealing with Donald Trump. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=162.84s)]
*  And so when I kind of tied the A block and this last thing I'll say is that we both we all know the two state solution hasn't worked. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=164.64s)]
*  Not going to work. Don't try it again. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=172.76s)]
*  But all the money that we're wasting on USAID and all the fraud and corruption, we've got to figure out a way to get the Palestinians out of Gaza for them to rebuild Gaza, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=174.64s)]
*  whether you move into one half and then build in that half or whether you pay money to Egypt and Abdullah in Jordan, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=185.44s)]
*  who's got a resistance to them because of what happened on Black September because of what the PLO did. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  But, you know, we got money. We can force countries to clear out Gaza. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=198.2s)]
*  That's the problem. That's the problem is like these countries nearby don't want to upset their political balance, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=202.6s)]
*  which is fragile by taking in like half a million Palestinians because then they lose power in Egypt or Jordan. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=209.28s)]
*  Actually, no one has ever cared about the Palestinians as much as the Americans have. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=215.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=220.56s)]
*  And I say that because who helps them? They sort of pretend to help them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=221.08s)]
*  Iran says, here, we'll help you if you kill Israelis, if you kill Jews. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=225.8s)]
*  And then Jordan is like, we've got so many and their economy is not great. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=231.84s)]
*  Egypt is like, well, we don't want them here. We've got problems with the Muslim Brotherhood. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=236.56s)]
*  It is nuanced. It is complicated. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=239.72000000000003s)]
*  It's complex. But what is not complicated is the issue of right and wrong when it comes to these hostages. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  So what he's saying is we're not going to be like Biden anymore. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  The Bidens, they were slow walking weapons to the Israelis like, well, we don't want to we don't want to go too far and actually actually win this thing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=251.16s)]
*  We want to we want to draw out the pain for as long as possible. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=258.56s)]
*  I actually do have a question, though, for the president. Does he mean noon? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  Our time or their time? Because it matters. It does matter. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=265.68s)]
*  It could be what's the time difference? Seven hours. Seven hours. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=268.88s)]
*  Are we talking five a.m.? This is the middle of Shabbat. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=271.56s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen on that front. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=274.4s)]
*  I also think this Hamas doesn't know how to deal with Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=277.12s)]
*  They said you're going to give Trump an ultimatum. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=280.2s)]
*  I don't think so. Like, you're going to try to out negotiate him. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  And you think he's joking. But I will end with this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=286.12s)]
*  I understand the sensitivity for the families of the hostages who we believe are alive, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=289.32s)]
*  because right now they are possibly in more danger than they have ever been in these next few days. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=295.44s)]
*  So I'm hoping that Hamas does the right thing and turns them over. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=301.0s)]
*  As Jeanine said, we've already we should say the Israelis have released 200 convicted terrorists. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. Did any of them look like they've been starved? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  Where's the United Nations? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=312.72s)]
*  My last point on this, actually, is we had hostages that were being held in some of the UNRWA camps. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  This was money that we were paying. Yeah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=320.2s)]
*  That they were giving to them. So the Bidens had it backwards. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=323.56s)]
*  They held back the weapons but gave the aid to Gaza. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  That's not the problem. It's like the opposite of what should have happened. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. So I want the opposite of nuance. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  Let's go to Jesse. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  Magazizstan. Do you think it's going to happen? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Is it a negotiation tactic? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  It is because there's a grand bargain. What to do with the Palestinians. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=341.36s)]
*  You do the displacement and the rebuild, but you also work in. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=345.0s)]
*  You want to redo the diplomacy between Saudis and the Israelis. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  And you also have to deal with the Iranian nuclear weapons. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=354.12s)]
*  So it's all one big negotiation. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=357.04s)]
*  I don't know how it plays in, but as Janine said, they cannot peacefully coexist. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=360.32s)]
*  The two-state solution, living side by side, it's an unrealistic expectation. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  So this, Gazizstan, is the only alternative. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not saying it's the answer, but right now it is the only alternative that's realistic. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=376.84s)]
*  So until the Arab powers come with their idea, this is the only idea at play right now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=381.76s)]
*  I love the deadline, Greg. I love having deadlines. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=388.48s)]
*  You saw how great deadlines were with tariff threats. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=391.36s)]
*  Now there's a military threat to back that up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=393.56s)]
*  And Hamas could miscalculate because they want to stretch the negotiation. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=396.56s)]
*  Once they give away all the hostages, they don't have any more bargaining chips than the ceasefires over. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=400.68s)]
*  And anything could happen. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=407.12s)]
*  So if they're going to test the Israelis and the Americans, the Americans and the Israelis have to understand [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=408.68s)]
*  if they're going to enforce them blowing off this deadline, they're going to have to risk, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=414.44s)]
*  possibly risking the lives of the hostages by going in with heavy strikes. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=421.03999999999996s)]
*  Are they willing to take that risk? I don't know. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=425.67999999999995s)]
*  But the Arab world, the Europeans, the media, they're not pressuring us. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=427.96s)]
*  They're not pressuring the Israelis. We have a free hand here. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=435.4s)]
*  But this this population in Palestine is hostile, uneducated. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=438.68s)]
*  It's even more radicalized than they were at the beginning of this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=446.0s)]
*  I mean, now they have no homes at all. They're even more hateful of the Israelis. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=449.92s)]
*  And their birth rate is explosive. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=455.2s)]
*  The average Palestinian woman has five and a half babies. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=457.88s)]
*  The average Israeli woman has only two and a half babies. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=461.76s)]
*  So demographically, they're a threat, not to mention the national security threat. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=466.04s)]
*  There is no way you can have these two peoples living side by side. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  Interesting. All right, Richard, close this out. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=476.72s)]
*  What is going to happen on Saturday? Give us your prediction. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=479.32000000000005s)]
*  I don't know, but I do hope that Hamas does release these hostages and I hope they do it soon. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  I have a lot of questions about the president's plan to sort of I think he said he's going to make sure that there's peaceful. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  There's going to be hotels, office, office buildings, et cetera. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=494.44s)]
*  And the reason why I have that is because I think no matter what side of the aisle you're on, we've we've sat at this table, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=498.04s)]
*  you and I, Greg, what we were talking about, Afghanistan and long American deployments. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  And the ideal of maintaining peace in this region to me sounds like the beginning of a long American deployment. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=505.88s)]
*  I want to know who's going to rebuild it. I want to know who's going to pay for it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=512.72s)]
*  I want to know how we're going to enforce the peace. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=516.2s)]
*  I want to know how long we're going to enforce the peace. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=519.68s)]
*  And I want to know if it's going to be another long American deployment to make that happen, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=522.56s)]
*  because I think whether no matter what side you live, no matter how old you are, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=525.8s)]
*  I don't want to see more American troops over there. Because to Jesse's point, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=528.72s)]
*  you have two group of people who do not like each other, who one group is more radicalized. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=531.6s)]
*  I think the Netanyahu government does not like the Palestinians. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=536.48s)]
*  I think we're in a world in which the ideal of maintaining that peace will require a long American deployment. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=539.56s)]
*  And I don't know if I like that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=544.24s)]
*  All right. Up next, President Trump is making the IRS audit the border. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jSvtm2ft_g&t=546.4399999999999s)]
