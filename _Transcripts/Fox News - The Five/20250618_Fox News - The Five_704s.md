# ‘The Five’ on if Trump will strike Iran’s nuclear sites
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y)
*  Let's get some quick reaction from Emily on the Karen Reid verdicts. All right guys, this was a textbook [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Illustration of how to nail it the second time around so essentially defense came in swinging because it was a second trial, right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Like surgery and here's what they did [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=12.08s)]
*  They targeted reasonable doubt through all of that missing text messages all of the digital evidence that was missing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=13.48s)]
*  They came in and said look we are turning the spoliation of evidence into something not right here [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=19.28s)]
*  And that's the thing the jurors didn't need to believe that there was this big orchestrated effort or event [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=24.02s)]
*  They just needed to believe that something wasn't right with all of those law enforcement officers that were concealing text [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=28.5s)]
*  Missing text destroying text per the defense right and they use reverse narrative to their benefit [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=34.78s)]
*  So they painted the defendant saying she's the Patsy [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=40.86s)]
*  She's the one that's getting framed her right victim over and over again John O'Keefe be damned essentially and then they repeated [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=43.82s)]
*  Undermining the chain of custody and the scene integrity. Why was his body moved? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  Look this is asking so many questions that they didn't have answers to and they didn't present them as just sloppy mistakes [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=54.58s)]
*  They presented them as this sort of intentional concealment of evidence [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=60.34s)]
*  And then finally they weaponized the arrogance that they framed for all of those protesters that you saw that raised a million dollars on [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=63.92s)]
*  Her behalf that hung on every word of the documentary that traveled by states to watch this, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=70.98s)]
*  They said look at this. These guys think they're pulling one over on all of you and that's why they nailed it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=75.8s)]
*  She's there OJ basically [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=81.14s)]
*  And gut felt will have the whole hour tonight [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  Stay tuned live. All right. Thank you guys, but let's talk about the big story [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=91.7s)]
*  We're following here president Trump still mauling a US military strike on Iran's nuclear sites [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=96.62s)]
*  But teased he's open to meeting with the mullahs at the White House [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=101.86s)]
*  I [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=105.28s)]
*  Have a plan for everything, but we'll see what happens kind of ways to go [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=106.8s)]
*  They should have looked they should have made the deal. I had a great deal for them [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=111.0s)]
*  They decided not to do it and now they wish they did it and they want to meet but it's late to me [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=114.28s)]
*  I don't want to get involved either [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=121.14s)]
*  But I've been saying for 20 years [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  Maybe longer that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=124.28s)]
*  I've been saying it for a long time you may have to fight and maybe it'll end and maybe it'll end very quickly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=127.84s)]
*  But there's no way that you can allow whether you have to fight or not [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=133.44s)]
*  You can allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon because the entire world will blow up not gonna let that happen [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  Katie have you ever seen a president keep his options so open? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=144.68s)]
*  For so long he is keeping options open [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  But the one thing he's made very clear throughout all of this is that the Iranian nuclear program is going away [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=153.24s)]
*  It is not staying he said today that it's going to either go away by us bombing it when they surrender or [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=158.3s)]
*  Bombing it if they don't surrender. So this program is going away [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=164.58s)]
*  It's just a matter of how they decide to do this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=167.78s)]
*  The timeline is that the Israelis say if the US were to get involved with the bombing campaign [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=170.62s)]
*  They can be done with this in a week, which the president has said he wants things to be done quickly [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=175.6s)]
*  He doesn't want these things to drag out. He's consistent with that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=180.3s)]
*  He is a track record in his first term of doing these strikes that are very significant [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=182.9s)]
*  Targeted and getting out of the way Soleimani. He did this with the Houthis. He did this with ISIS [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  There's no reason to stick around and wait it out [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=192.9s)]
*  So he is in another meeting today with his national security team and all options are on the table [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=195.62s)]
*  But if you listen to what he's saying [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  It's very clear that this is going in the direction of Iran's nuclear program is going away [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=202.5s)]
*  For the better of the United States of America and for the region [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=207.26000000000002s)]
*  I think it's very interesting that you've heard a lot about well [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=210.5s)]
*  They don't want this to devolve into a broader war in the region [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  The region's not saying anything the Saudis are happy with this their Jordanians are happy with this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=217.3s)]
*  The UAE is happy with this and if you look at the images that you see of these people sending in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  video from Lebanon from Jordan from [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=227.78s)]
*  UAE seeing these missiles flying through the sky [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=230.94s)]
*  The only people sending those are the Iranians and they don't want them to be the target next [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=233.26000000000002s)]
*  So the program's going away. It's just a matter of when and how [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=237.46s)]
*  Harold does the president have the support of the Democrats in the Senate and in Congress for a strike against this nuclear facility? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=242.06s)]
*  I hope so, but let me go back because I think your question is the right one [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=250.18s)]
*  I would broaden it out. I think to Katie's point. It's good to be back around the table with everybody [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=254.28s)]
*  I think the question that the president who's grappling with the most consequential decision that he's ever had to make I think in his life [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=258.38s)]
*  Certainly as president the first term and certainly up to this point and I can't imagine a more consequential one for the next three years [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=266.78s)]
*  I think the president's asking the question [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  What if what if we don't act in light of all that the Israelis have done and really? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=275.62s)]
*  Softening and diminishing the military power the Air Force the Navy the army [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=281.9s)]
*  Their ability to launch rockets at Israel and for that matter anywhere in the region and they've done [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=287.06s)]
*  They've done a lot the president took an oath of office everyone does to protect and defend the Constitution in the country [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=293.1s)]
*  Regardless of whom the president is not your campaign dogma not your campaign platform not your rally speeches [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=299.14000000000004s)]
*  And this is where it gets really tough to I hope the president's applying the Powell doctrine to this Jesse which [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  Former the late Secretary of Defense and late Joint Chiefs of Staff asked a couple of questions [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  He asked do we have a vital security interest we do they say that to America [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  Do we have a clear attainable objective Katie laid it out well, I think the president has laid it out [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=321.3s)]
*  We want to undermine and neutralize this a nuclear capacity of theirs and their ability to launch missiles [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=326.78s)]
*  Three do we have an exit strategy and have we consider the consequences of what may happen? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm confident the president his team are doing that and this gets to the last point are the American people in support [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=338.5s)]
*  Which is what your question contemplates not just Democrats [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  It appears as we sit here tonight the president's facing more opposition from Republicans and perhaps some in the MAGA [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=346.34s)]
*  Community than he is anywhere else [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=352.06s)]
*  I hope if the president decides to do something whatever that might be and I support him [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=353.62s)]
*  That he comes before the country at the appropriate time and lays out for us [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=357.98s)]
*  Why he's doing it what we're doing and how we're gonna get how we're gonna get out of it and finally the Israelis have done [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  A lot if they had not done all they had done have done up to this point [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=367.4s)]
*  I may not be as in favor of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=370.74s)]
*  Going after the the nuclear facility as I am what they've done over the last year [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  Particularly the last six months has been nothing short of astonishing. So whatever the president decides to do [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  I hope the country supports him, but he's gonna have to lay out clearly [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  Convincingly and forcefully while we're doing it. Do you believe Emily the president's done a good job explaining to the American people the stakes? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=386.66s)]
*  Well, I think he's done a good job explaining to the American people that he's protecting American interests [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=394.62s)]
*  And he's staying true to why we voted for him [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=399.26000000000005s)]
*  Which was peace through strength with the end result of including not ditching our allies and always [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=401.38000000000005s)]
*  Holding American interests first and that's why it's you know to those saying that it's not America first to not even take out for now [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=408.22s)]
*  I look number one. It removes a direct time sensitive threat to the US [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=414.74s)]
*  It's a hell of a lot cheaper than the trickle, you know sort of policy that Biden had [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  Oh, here's a little bit of material support over years and years or the wait-and-see approach of him the Dems [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=424.82s)]
*  Which includes by the way the priceless toll of the 603 Americans that have died at the hands of the Islamic regime [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=430.38s)]
*  And for those worried about mission creep, that's this that's what this would stop right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=436.74s)]
*  This is strength without spread and the biggest result is deterrence mess with a bull you get the horns [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  That's what message he's been clear on and that's why people voted for him and inside note [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  I've many friends in Tel Aviv right now Katie. I know you do too [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=451.88s)]
*  One of them a missile hit the building 80 feet away from his apartment while he was in the shelter [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=454.54s)]
*  It destroyed the entire block somehow his apartment was okay because it was protected by the buildings [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=459.14000000000004s)]
*  He said we're experiencing what we've never experienced before but he said but it's necessary to finish the job and destroy the nuclear [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=463.26000000000005s)]
*  Facilities in Iran that is someone that understands the message understands patriotism and understands an existential crisis that they're facing [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=470.02000000000004s)]
*  How do you see it Greg many different ways Jesse? I'm glad you asked first of all, I'm always [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=477.82000000000005s)]
*  Surprised that people that are so against trade wars are more open to real wars [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=483.1s)]
*  It's not I don't you find that kind of like a cut [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=490.18s)]
*  They do like the people that are against trade wars always talk about the blowback of a trade war. We talk about it forever [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=492.76s)]
*  But with real wars, we don't we don't even know what's next after we decide to do this [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=499.90000000000003s)]
*  And we often don't that's why we ended up with Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=506.1s)]
*  There is a lot of blowback at least with trade wars you can turn off the spigot you can go back in time and stop it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=510.5s)]
*  About the America first thing that was why Trump was elected, but it's not like he isn't being America first already [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=517.02s)]
*  It's like been 150 days [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=525.06s)]
*  We've seen look at the border. No crossings. No releases [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=527.5s)]
*  workers rages or workers wages are up [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=532.22s)]

*  It's divorced from context the guy is doing America first every single day [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=557.92s)]

*  That's where the question is in a way Iran is like an unstable teenager who posts online [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  About wanting to shoot up a school, you know, when do you take their threats and capabilities? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=581.8s)]
*  Seriously, like you know, do you know what his capabilities are? Does this kid have guns at home? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't know so you have to weigh the cost is like what? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=592.2s)]
*  Harold said that the cost of inaction is an action. It's an action. So America first has two lanes [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  America first and what are the options in the Middle East that are best for American interests? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=603.48s)]

*  we elected Trump for his instincts and his guts his gut instinct and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, maybe he knows a way to defend this our staunchest ally without sacrificing our sons [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=619.5600000000001s)]
*  And he doesn't do things that he thinks will end badly [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=625.52s)]
*  That's one thing we know he jumps in when he sees a path and he senses [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=629.84s)]
*  I think he senses Israel has done the work and I think that's another thing that he respects Israel for is that they always [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=635.24s)]
*  Do the work he likes winners and I think he sees this event Israel as a winning bet [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=641.2s)]

*  They have done not only on social media. They've acted on some of it through their proxy. So yeah [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=665.32s)]
*  No, it was a rough analogy Harold. It wasn't the real thing. Don't nitpick the analogy [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMaleqm4w0Y&t=669.0400000000001s)]
