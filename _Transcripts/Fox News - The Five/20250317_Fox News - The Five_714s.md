# Gutfeld: Dems wouldn't be alone in a room with the deported migrants they're defending
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ)
*  I can tell you this, these were bad people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  That was a bad group of, as I say, hombres. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=2.88s)]
*  That was a bad group. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=6.96s)]
*  When you look at them and you look at the crimes [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=8.68s)]
*  that they've committed, you take a look. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=11.16s)]
*  You don't get any tougher. You don't get worse than that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=14.08s)]
*  And now they're gone. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=16.8s)]
*  President Trump defending his move to deport [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=17.92s)]
*  suspected TDA gang members as Democrats [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  side with foreign terrorist organizations [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=24.48s)]
*  that's responsible for some horrific crimes [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=26.6s)]
*  against American citizens. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=28.96s)]
*  I'm not sure why. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=30.36s)]
*  We got new footage showing hundreds of illegal [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=31.52s)]
*  criminal gang members from Venezuela [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=33.76s)]
*  getting dropped off at a mega prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=35.96s)]
*  They get free haircuts. That's a good thing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=39.36s)]
*  President Trump deported them under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  A federal judge tried to block the move [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  and a hearing on that is currently underway. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=47.24s)]
*  The Trump DOJ apparently wants the judge tossed off [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=49.64s)]
*  the El Salvador deportation case. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=52.6s)]
*  Now the White House claims the migrants were already [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=54.56s)]
*  on the flights and out of the U.S. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=57.04s)]
*  If actually was true when the judge made his decision. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=58.96s)]
*  Plus they had good reason to get them out quickly. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=61.84s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=65.08s)]
*  These are monsters who tortured, raped and murdered [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  a 12 year old Jocelyn Nungre. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=69.72s)]
*  And they tortured her to death. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=71.28s)]
*  They sexually assaulted her. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=73.08s)]
*  They stripped her and they dumped her body in a river. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=74.68s)]
*  That's who President Trump is deported from this country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=77.28s)]
*  Behind every single one of those terrorists [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=80.12s)]
*  was another future rape victim, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=82.4s)]
*  another future sex trafficking victim, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=83.92s)]
*  another future murder victim. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=85.92s)]
*  But as usual reminders like that of the gang's brutality [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  never seem to get mentioned by Democratic lawmakers [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=90.96s)]
*  or the pundits of the media. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=93.96s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=95.52s)]
*  What he is doing to Venezuelans is disgusting. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  But you know what? You voted for that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  You're finding out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  Any one of us could find ourselves [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=102.84s)]
*  being deported to some country. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=105.64s)]
*  It is the fact that we can't trust this administration [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=107.84s)]
*  to actually use a scalpel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  But instead they love to use a butcher knife on things. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=113.64s)]
*  We're not gonna be there to allow you to just take people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  off the streets and split up families. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  We're not at war with the gang [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=122.96s)]
*  that is the subject of the executive order. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=125.72s)]
*  There is no invasion that is going on. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=129.72s)]
*  There's the author of the Mueller report by the way. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  All right, so TDA, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=135.6s)]
*  we're just randomly grabbing Venezuelan judge. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta be careful. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=139.64s)]
*  And we're just putting him on planes, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=140.48s)]
*  giving him that unitard [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=141.44s)]
*  and telling him to go up there, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  tip your waitresses, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=144.76s)]
*  give him a free haircut and send them to prison. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Why are we doing that? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=148.04s)]
*  Well, you gotta be careful. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=149.0s)]
*  I mean, if you watch the view, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=150.16s)]
*  they could pick any one of us and send us out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=151.2s)]
*  Look, they are so not aware of what's going on. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Trent A. Arague has been declared [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=157.68s)]
*  a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=159.16s)]
*  As a result of that, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  there is an argument under the 1798 statute [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=162.84s)]
*  that has been the Alien Enemies Act [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=167.12s)]
*  that has been used three times [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=169.48s)]
*  that they are a group that is actually involved [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=171.48s)]
*  with the Venezuelan government [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=174.72s)]
*  and the El Salvadoran government, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=176.32s)]
*  and therefore they can be deported. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=178.28s)]
*  Now, aside from the Alien Enemies Act, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  they are illegal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=183.56s)]
*  They are committing crimes, okay? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=185.16s)]
*  We do not have to have them convicted of a crime [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=187.72s)]
*  to remove them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=190.76s)]
*  But the argument that the administration is making, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=191.92s)]
*  which I think is brilliant, is this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  They are saying that under Article II of the Constitution, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=196.44s)]
*  the president has the authority to engage in foreign policy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=199.2s)]
*  And the president and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  have been engaging in foreign policy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=206.64s)]
*  with Berkeley as well as Maduro. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=208.64s)]
*  And they have worked out an arrangement [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  where Berkeley is taking these TDA members [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=213.48s)]
*  for $6 million and a local judge, make no mistake, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=217.04s)]
*  this is a local judge, folks, who is a trial judge. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  He's not even an appellate judge. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=224.72s)]
*  He thinks he can stop international diplomacy [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  for national security issues that involve the American people [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  because he's a local federal judge. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=235.28s)]
*  He's stupid. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=237.72s)]
*  And let me tell you one more thing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=238.72s)]
*  Tren de Aragua and MS-16, these people are savages. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  I used to prosecute them as a DA. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  They are brutal, medieval, barbaristic savages, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=246.76s)]
*  and they should be removed from this country immediately [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  without any explanation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=253.44s)]
*  And if the Democrats want to take the side [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=255.08s)]
*  of these savages, let them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  But the truth is Donald Trump is protecting the Democrat big cities [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=259.88s)]
*  and the people who live in them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=263.24s)]
*  Dana, it looks like there was 261 sent out, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=264.56s)]
*  101 were Venezuelans. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=267.48s)]
*  But there's going to be a two-week pause [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=269.24s)]
*  as the judge gets a chance to evaluate who the next group are [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=270.92s)]
*  and is he allowed to do this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=274.88s)]
*  I find it very hard to imagine that these gang members [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=276.92s)]
*  are going to get back on a plane and come to America [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=280.2s)]
*  and have hearings here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=282.12s)]
*  I think that's definitely not going to happen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=284.16s)]
*  Tell me the next group. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=286.88s)]
*  That's what the Democrats are thinking about, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=287.68s)]
*  what would happen. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=289.12s)]
*  But the communications on this is so fascinating to me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=289.6s)]
*  So first of all, you have a judge that's sort of like, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=292.08s)]
*  you know, like when a low-level security officer gets a whistle [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=294.4s)]
*  and then they just want to blow it all the time [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=298.92s)]
*  and they feel powerful with the whistle, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=300.64s)]
*  sort of feels like that a little bit. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=302.96s)]
*  I also understand there is due process, I get it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=304.56s)]
*  But I think I'm not going to argue the law. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=306.48s)]
*  Of course, the judge has all of that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=308.24s)]
*  But this is how I think American people look at this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=310.08s)]
*  So you're telling me that one president can let all the TDA [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  members come in, but the next president can't get them out? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=318.52s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense to people. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=323.44s)]
*  And the president is running circles around the opposition [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=325.28s)]
*  and he baits them into defending the gang members. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  And again, they're so mixed up in their own problems [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  with Chuck Schumer and the anti-Semitism. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=337.68s)]
*  And they don't have a coherent message just to be like, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=339.72s)]
*  guys, we want them out of here too. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=342.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=343.72s)]
*  So Greg, were you upset when they didn't turn the plane [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  around in mid-flight last day? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=347.16s)]
*  Were you able to have a good weekend anyway, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=349.04s)]
*  look on the bright side? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm glad that, Brian, that this is funny to you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  I'm sure you're getting a big kick out of these young men. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=355.16s)]
*  We don't know any. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=359.36s)]
*  How many of those men are honor roll students? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=360.48s)]
*  You don't know that, right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=363.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  These are dreamers. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=366.0s)]
*  They're dreamers. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  And we're sending them out there. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=368.4s)]
*  Some of them identify as grandmothers. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=370.08s)]
*  We are sending grandmothers back to dangerous countries. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=372.4s)]
*  How soon will you find that one case? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=376.44s)]
*  The Democrats will find that one case. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  I already have it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=381.44s)]
*  Yeah, you did. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  Let me guess. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  Is his name Jose? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=385.08s)]
*  Let's say Jose Cuervo. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=386.96s)]
*  But he has a child, a child with reverse dyslexia [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=388.32s)]
*  and a stutter. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=391.96s)]
*  And now Jose is gone. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  And who's going to take care of this child? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=395.88s)]
*  They do this with those. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=397.96s)]
*  They do this with the abortion ruling. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=398.96s)]
*  And they will find one example. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  You need only one example to derail [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=402.23999999999995s)]
*  adult-like behavior that makes sense to everybody. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  These are all criminals. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=409.0s)]
*  What did I say in the A-block? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  And be careful, Jessica. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=411.2s)]
*  I don't want you to become this person. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=412.2s)]
*  About the women who marry men on death row, you saw the view. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=414.24s)]
*  You saw Crockett. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=418.64s)]
*  You've listened to AOC. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=419.96s)]
*  These are all young, well, and some really old women, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=421.2s)]
*  defending killers and rapists. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=425.76s)]

*  be alone in a room with them? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=430.76s)]
*  The people you're defending, would you [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=432.56s)]
*  get on a subway car with the Tren De La [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=435.0s)]
*  Rogwins or whatever they're called? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=437.08000000000004s)]
*  They're just a club. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=438.6s)]
*  But we totally glossed over the best part of the story. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=440.92s)]
*  The video is amazing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  It was directed by Michael Bay or something. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=446.24s)]
*  Did you watch it? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=449.24s)]
*  Better than anything on Netflix. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=450.24s)]
*  Anything. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=452.2s)]
*  There was no- [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=452.72s)]
*  Prison break. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=453.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=454.12s)]
*  There was nobody tied to a chair. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  There weren't like three women. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  One woman beating up three guys, which happens in every Jack [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=459.76s)]
*  Reacher episode. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=463.08s)]
*  There was no Kevin Hart, no Nicole Kidman. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=464.4s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=466.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  But she's in everything. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=470.2s)]
*  How about John Marcarubio worked out [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=470.84s)]
*  the deal with El Salvador the first week he was there. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=472.32s)]
*  He said, if you want, I'll take your prisoners. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  Venezuela, we can't count on them to put them in prison [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=477.0s)]
*  because they let them out one time. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  Just for the record, if you have reverse dyslexia, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't think you have dyslexia. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=483.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  That's what I wrote down too. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=485.64s)]
*  I was like, exactly. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=486.76s)]
*  That is happening. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=487.76s)]
*  I wanted to see if you were listening, Brian. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  I was for a change. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=490.88s)]
*  And thank you, I believe I passed the test. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=491.8s)]
*  It invalidates everything that you said. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=493.32s)]
*  Jessica, your thoughts. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=494.96000000000004s)]

*  No. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=499.24s)]
*  Listen, it's ludicrous to allege that any Democrat is [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=500.2s)]
*  losing sleep or upset over verified gang members who [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=505.16s)]
*  have raped and tortured and murdered Americans [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=509.56s)]
*  being sent out of here. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  Great if you negotiated that deal. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=514.36s)]
*  I think we're paying $6 million to the El Salvadorian [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=515.96s)]
*  government for them to take them into these prison camps. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  Get to the one case. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=521.04s)]
*  Funny you should mention that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  No, there is good reason that everybody [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  is saying alleged members and suspected members. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=528.12s)]
*  Because these people, as Dana said, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=531.6s)]
*  have not gotten their due process. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=533.36s)]
*  And there's an immigration attorney [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=534.88s)]
*  who has been posting about her client who was supposed [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=536.6s)]
*  to show up in court on Thursday, has been disappeared since [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=539.32s)]
*  is allegedly on this plane. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=543.92s)]
*  And this person is here. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=545.12s)]
*  What was he supposed to show up in court for? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=546.48s)]
*  He had a legitimate asylum claim. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=548.12s)]
*  He had tattoos. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=550.28s)]
*  A legitimate asylum. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=551.28s)]
*  It's not legitimate until a judge says it's legitimate. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=552.28s)]
*  If you make it so that that person can't see a judge, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  then you're denying their due process. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=557.92s)]
*  I don't know if I buy it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=559.56s)]
*  What Trump is essentially saying is that the asylum system, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=560.48s)]
*  as we know it, is done. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  That you can show up here and you're [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=565.52s)]
*  fleeing from persecution in Venezuela, for instance, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=567.72s)]
*  and you don't get your day in court. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=570.68s)]
*  So if that's what it is moving forward, then just say that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=572.48s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=574.96s)]
*  But you know the asylum system has been gamed. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=575.76s)]
*  It is completely exploited by criminals. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=578.28s)]
*  Most don't even show up and most don't get approval. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=580.28s)]
*  You can throw whatever you want at the wall. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm still going to finish what I'm saying. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=584.24s)]
*  That's not at the wall. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=585.24s)]
*  That's just facts. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=586.04s)]
*  No, but it isn't facts. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  We should build a wall. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=589.16s)]
*  This is for their illegal. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=590.24s)]
*  They don't belong here in the first place. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=591.52s)]
*  They weren't invited. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=593.2s)]
*  Then just be honest and say it's not [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=594.44s)]
*  about getting criminals out. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=596.44s)]
*  It's about getting everyone out who is here illegally, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=597.5600000000001s)]
*  that we can pick up anyone. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=600.12s)]
*  That's not what be Goldberg or Joy Behar. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=601.24s)]
*  Obviously, they're not going to do the worst first. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=602.92s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=604.92s)]
*  But why is this person? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=605.8s)]
*  See, one person. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=607.24s)]
*  No, but this is the first flight. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=608.04s)]
*  Why can't you just wait to let everyone get processed? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=610.64s)]
*  So you agree already? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=614.48s)]
*  Yes, it's the first flight of deportation from the spirit world. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=615.36s)]
*  I'm going to give you this. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=617.44s)]
*  I'm so glad you agree with what's being done. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=618.52s)]
*  You just have a problem with how it's being done. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=621.52s)]
*  So we're making progress. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=624.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=625.36s)]
*  I would say this. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=625.88s)]
*  They've been rounded up. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  They have 37,000 have been rounded up. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=627.64s)]
*  And I don't even think it's been quick enough. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=629.56s)]
*  I think there's a lot more criminals. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=631.2399999999999s)]
*  There were no sanctuary cities who had a lot of them. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=632.4s)]
*  But doesn't it, as an advocate for our legal system, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  and you certainly believe in due process, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=638.1199999999999s)]
*  are you not disturbed by the idea [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=639.76s)]
*  that there could be people on this flight? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=641.04s)]
*  No, I'm not disturbed because they're illegal [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=641.88s)]
*  and the entrance into these. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=643.76s)]
*  Why can't they claim asylum? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=645.0s)]
*  First of all, the Democrats couldn't even [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  say the word Lake in Raleigh. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=647.52s)]
*  Now they want its talk on behalf of Trending Iran. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=649.16s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=651.16s)]
*  You just didn't like how he said it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=651.88s)]
*  I didn't like how who said it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=653.92s)]
*  No, he mispronounced it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  He mispronounced it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=656.04s)]
*  Well, Marjorie Telegreen yelled it out. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=656.88s)]
*  They couldn't say it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  No, he didn't say it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=659.12s)]
*  You know what you're doing. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=660.12s)]
*  The man that he's saying it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=661.52s)]
*  You're saying due process doesn't matter. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  And you know what, Jocelyn Nungeri is another victim [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=664.4s)]

*  And how about the apartments? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=668.48s)]
*  I'm just saying, if you don't believe in due process [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=669.68s)]
*  anymore, then be honest about it, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=671.72s)]
*  because that's what's going on here. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=673.12s)]
*  The only due process I believe in [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=674.92s)]
*  is the legal way to enter this country. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=676.76s)]
*  But claiming asylum is legal. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=678.6s)]
*  Only if you do the legal process. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=680.8s)]
*  But they tried. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=682.44s)]
*  And then they're being disappeared [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=683.24s)]
*  from their court hearing. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYHeRMz8lSQ&t=684.72s)]
