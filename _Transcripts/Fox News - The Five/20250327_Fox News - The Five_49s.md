# Gutfeld: This is why Democrats are really opposed to DOGE #shorts #doge #democrats #foxnews
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ)
*  Why is Doge, with the goal of eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, so upsetting to today's Democrats, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  when it wasn't upsetting to Barack Obama, who used those same terms, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=7.0s)]
*  and it wasn't upsetting to Bill Clinton, who actually did it? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=11.4s)]
*  So it was really popular among them. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=15.0s)]
*  But now, if you go after waste, fraud, and abuse, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=17.7s)]
*  you're actually attacking the nature of the Democrat Party [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=21.3s)]
*  because it has been infested with wokeism, which is behind these programs. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  So if you go after these ridiculously absurd programs, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=28.9s)]
*  you're actually going after their ideology. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=32.1s)]
*  So what was once silly and extreme under, even under Obama, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=35.1s)]
*  which was like a decade ago, I can't remember, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=38.7s)]
*  is now considered basically the system itself, not a bug in the system. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2_G4XOFAQ&t=41.7s)]
