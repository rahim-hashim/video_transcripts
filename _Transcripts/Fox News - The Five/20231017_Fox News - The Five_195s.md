# Judge Jeanine: I'm so angry we're in this situation
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w)
*  The search for a new House Speaker is still happening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman Jim Jordan losing on the first vote for the gavel, and it's unclear if he [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=7.12s)]
*  has enough support to get to the magic number, which is 217. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=10.08s)]
*  Congressman Jordan announcing that a second vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=14.16s)]
*  The guy who had the job two weeks ago, Congressman Kevin McCarthy, is speaking out, and he's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=18.2s)]
*  blaming Democrats for the chaos. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  You had every single Democrat, along with eight Republicans, vote to shut down one branch [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=26.36s)]
*  of government. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=32.0s)]
*  That is why we're in the... [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=33.0s)]
*  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, let's go back to how it got here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=34.0s)]
*  We wouldn't be here if every single Democrat didn't vote with eight Republicans to shut [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=36.68s)]
*  this place down. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=41.24s)]
*  Greg, that to me is an interesting take on why we're where we are, but would you, would [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=43.44s)]
*  you have an opinion on this? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=48.88s)]
*  You agree with Mr. McCarthy or have a different opinion? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=50.44s)]
*  I don't know if I have an opinion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=51.92s)]
*  I kind of want Jim Jordan to win, so maybe he might wear a jacket. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=53.4s)]
*  But this, I mean, obviously, given what's been going on, this feels really small and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  petty. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=61.76s)]
*  It just shows you that petty politics is immortal. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=62.76s)]
*  No matter what happens, this goes on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=65.24s)]
*  We have bigger fish to fry, and by fish, I mean Hamas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=67.22s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=70.88s)]
*  Judge? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=72.16s)]
*  I was looking up the names of the eight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=73.56s)]
*  I'm so angry that we're even in this situation at this point in time with the Democrats. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=75.36s)]
*  McCarthy is absolutely right. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=81.72s)]
*  McCarthy did everything the Democrats predicted. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  The Republicans would shut down the government and people in the military wouldn't get a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=88.8s)]
*  check. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=93.0s)]
*  Now we're in a situation where they need their checks. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=94.0s)]
*  And now McCarthy kept the government open, and now the Democrats are voting to get them [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=95.8s)]
*  out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=100.6s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=101.6s)]
*  And everyone who was involved in that, Nancy Mace, Matt Gaetz, all of them, were in this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=102.6s)]
*  mess because of them. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=106.56s)]
*  And Jim Jordan's great. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=108.44s)]
*  Scalise is great. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=109.76s)]
*  McCarthy was great. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=110.76s)]
*  I don't know what the, it's petty nonsense. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=112.0s)]
*  Jesse? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  You're asking me about the speaker situation? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Do you blame the Democrats for the situation we're in right now? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=119.64s)]
*  That's what you call brilliant framing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  You make this about the Democrats. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=124.36s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=127.2s)]
*  Yes, it is technically true. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  All of the House Democrats and eight Republicans shut down the Congress. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=129.32s)]
*  Now Congress is shut down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=135.32s)]
*  Do you notice anything different? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=138.32s)]
*  Has your life changed? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=139.32s)]
*  I feel like the Israelis are going to get the money. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=140.88s)]
*  Why would you say that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=144.4s)]
*  What do you mean, Greg? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=145.4s)]
*  Advice of counsel, I'd like to go to data. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=148.4s)]
*  Well, I would say where's the problem solvers caucus when you need them? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  This is a problem that you would think needs solved, and they have lots of Democrats that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=155.4s)]
*  could help solve it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=160.0s)]
*  You see what they said over the weekend? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=161.44s)]
*  They said five to ten of them would join with all the Republicans to give Patrick McHenry [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  the limited power for the next to do that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=167.16s)]
*  Did that happen? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=169.24s)]
*  They may have to do it tonight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=171.16s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=172.16s)]
*  Tomorrow. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=173.16s)]
*  But it's amazing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=174.16s)]
*  Let me just let that right here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=175.16s)]
*  This is not the Democrats' problem. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=176.16s)]
*  If the Democrats had a majority, they would choose a speaker. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=177.16s)]
*  One more thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  Always the Democrats. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  One more thing is up next. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  Let me write that down. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpijH1Z58w&t=181.76000000000002s)]
