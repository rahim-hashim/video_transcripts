# 'The Five': 'HOT COMMIE SUMMER'?
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk)
*  Get ready for what Wall Street's calling hot commie summer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=0.0s)]
*  Axios reports that establishment Democrats are melting down a quote full-on freakout [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=3.52s)]
*  over socialist Zoran the Destroyer crushing Andrew Cuomo in the New York City's mayor's race. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Donors are fearful he could hurt the party's brand nationally. Comrade Z wants to defund the police, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  legalize prostitution, and he sees this as a model for the nation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=21.6s)]
*  Do you think that is a platform that would work for other candidates running in other parts of the country? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. I think ultimately this is a campaign about inequality and you don't have to live in the most expensive city in the country [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=32.96s)]
*  to have experienced that inequality because it's a national issue. In focusing on working people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=41.36s)]
*  and their struggles we also return back to what makes so many of us proud to be Democrats in the first place. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=46.16s)]
*  Dana, are the Republicans happy about Zoran the Destroyer? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=51.839999999999996s)]
*  I think it's mixed. Yes, in a way. I do think that they think, okay, well we can really go after this guy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=57.28s)]
*  And in a way it's only Trump's campaign who was able to match the kind of TikTok-ness of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=63.68s)]
*  campaign tactics that he had. If you think about Cuomo wanting to run against this guy, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=71.28s)]
*  he was basically running a campaign from the 1970s. It felt so old and the messaging was old. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=77.2s)]
*  And then you have Mondani who, it's like even if you were not into the policies, you're kind of taken in by [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=83.36s)]
*  the look and feel and the vibe of the campaign. So I think there's that. But I also think there are [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=91.84s)]
*  plenty of Republicans who think this is actually dangerous. You have people who support him saying, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=96.48s)]
*  but real socialism has never been tried. Basically, again, you go back to the fact that nobody goes to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=102.72s)]
*  school, nobody knows their history, etc. I also think that the city has been hollowed out of a lot [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  of families. It's very difficult and very expensive to raise families in this city. So you have a lot [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  of young single people that are here and you have a lot of older white liberals that really liked it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=120.24s)]
*  And then you had the low-income people who are saying, well they don't want him. This is going to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=126.08s)]
*  be a big fight. To me, Eric Adams feels a little low energy and I don't think he understands the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=130.56s)]
*  way to try to beat him. Look at, like we're just showing the video here. It's pretty amazing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=137.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm liking this. The question I would like to ask him is, what does he think happened to the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=141.52s)]
*  one billion dollars that Bill de Blasio gave to his wife to work on homeless issues in this city? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=147.28s)]
*  Gave her a billion dollars. Take it over, do whatever you need. They lost all the money. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=154.16s)]
*  Where do you think it went? What do you think went wrong? Government wasn't charged then. What [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=159.36s)]
*  do you think, sir, went wrong there? Where did that money go? Is it a bad thing that that money was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=162.96s)]
*  lost? Who do you think that money came from, etc.? There's so many questions you could put to him, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  but if it's a campaign on vibes, he's got the edge. Hot commie summer. You psyched? Yeah, so on the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  one, first of all, I love the idea that somebody like Andrew Cuomo paid a price for his handling [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  of COVID. I think that's fantastic. Unfortunately, this is probably not the right lesson to learn [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=184.8s)]
*  from it. Government run grocery stores are not, can you imagine getting your groceries from somebody [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=190.24s)]
*  that it looks like one of the people that mans the stations in the subway and cares about your food [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=196.72s)]
*  delivery, your food order as much as that person cares about your safety? It's not going to be [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=204.4s)]
*  pretty. The other thing that I do love about this is that there are a few places that are [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  bluer political entities than New York City, and this is a confirmation that Democrat policies [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=216.08s)]
*  absolutely fail. Even Democrat voters hate Democrat policies because they have rejected [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=223.12s)]
*  normal Democrat policies in favor of this loony stuff. And as for, I'm sure Republicans who live [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=230.8s)]
*  here are not too excited about this, but if you're President Trump and you're a Republican running [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=238.88s)]
*  anywhere else in the country, we're not making this stuff up. There really are people who believe [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=244.24s)]
*  this stuff, who believe in socialism, and there are voters who support it, and that is very, very good [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=249.04s)]
*  for Republicans. On a scale of one to 10, Jessica, how scared are you if he wins? He's not my first [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  choice. No, listen, there are many issues that I have with his platform. I don't think [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=264.64s)]
*  it's feasible to have a $30 minimum wage. If you want to say that we should have more food pantries [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  instead of government-run grocery stores, I think we could talk about that. But pie in the sky kind [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=280.96s)]
*  of stuff that you often hear from the left, though people did tell Bill de Blasio that universal [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=286.96s)]
*  pre-K was pie in the sky, and we have it now, and everybody loves it and takes advantage of it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=292.48s)]
*  People who even would technically have enough money for private school because the public schools [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=297.92s)]
*  have gotten better in the city in certain areas are using it. And then there's the whole conversation [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  about positions that he's taken, like supporting the BDS movement, his statement that came out on [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=307.92s)]
*  October 8th after the atrocity of October 7th, which also condemned Israel. Those are things that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=313.36s)]
*  are very difficult for me. But two things are important. One, he wasn't running against your [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=318.24s)]
*  average member of the Democratic establishment. Andrew Cuomo was a pretty uniquely flawed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=324.88s)]
*  candidate for this. And like Dana said, he ran a lifeless campaign. I watched a lot of the events, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=330.08s)]
*  know a lot of people who worked in his orbit, and it was pretty joyless. And Mamdani was joyful [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=336.0s)]
*  every single second that he was doing this, even when he was getting grilled about past positions [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=342.96s)]
*  that he's taken. You know, how are you going to get this to work? He looked like he was having a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=348.32s)]
*  blast. And on the question of where you say, well, socialism doesn't work, there's a real split [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=352.4s)]
*  between what younger people think socialism means and what older people think socialism means. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  Younger people think it means tax the rich. Older people think it means bread lines. And that's where [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=362.64s)]
*  you're seeing this real division. But people who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=369.12s)]
*  Like I said, he wasn't my top choice. So it does look like this guy is about vibes and the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=374.8s)]
*  Democrats all they care about is someone who looks like they're having a good time. Doesn't [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=380.08s)]
*  matter what they're for as long as they look like they're having fun. That's the only acceptable [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=384.24s)]
*  explanation for this because to me, this is a joyfully wrapped total anti-statamite that is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=389.04s)]
*  hell bent on destroying the city even further. I spoke with a prominent New York City businessman [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=396.08s)]
*  earlier today and he said, you know, you asked her if she was scared. He said, as a Jew, I'm angry, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=400.48s)]
*  scared and abandoned. He said, I'm scared my kids will not be able to live in America. He said, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=405.84s)]
*  this is how it starts by that one on your screen. And he said, this isn't as much about Mom Donnie [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=411.04s)]
*  as it is my friends and neighbors abandoning us. So everyone here in this borough that voted for that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=415.76s)]
*  totally and utterly abandoned the Jewish community here and across the world. And I think it is [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=422.24s)]
*  fantastic to even entertain his policies that are rooted in utter nonsense. So you have America's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=427.2s)]
*  worst mayor, de Blasio, who came in and said, well, he was successful because he talked about [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  kitchen table issues, direct quote. He said, rent affordability. People are struggling to make ends [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=437.36s)]
*  meet. He talked about the basics of life, food. First of all, that's not what this person was [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  talking about. Mom Donnie is talking about handouts. He's talking about gimmicks. He's [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=447.36s)]
*  diving in the Hudson while he wants everyone to have free everything. The reason older people [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  think of socialism as bread lines is because they lived it, because they lived through World War [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=456.08000000000004s)]
*  II and through communist adventures that were utterly destructive and fatal. So everyone who [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=460.24s)]
*  has the luxury here of voting for Mom Donnie, which I find it ironic because despite those [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=465.6s)]
*  those who are struggling for basics and struggling to make ends meet, as de Blasio said, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=471.12s)]
*  those guys voted for Cuomo. It was your typical rich, overeducated elite snobs that voted for Mom [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=475.04s)]
*  Donnie. And the fact that they overlook the fact that he hates Jews is the worst thing of all. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, you could still door dash the bread. You could just have the delivery guy wait in line [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  for you. Problem solved. Up next, Jasmine Crockett thinks it's racist to deport dangerous [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  criminal migrants. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=498.16s)]
*  And you won't get it anywhere else. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPe7qiwiKk&t=505.04s)]
