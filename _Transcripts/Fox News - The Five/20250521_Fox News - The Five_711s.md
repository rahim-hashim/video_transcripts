# ‘The Five’ calls out ‘FAKE' Tapper on Biden health flip-flop
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8)
*  This is the guy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello everyone, I'm Shannon Bream along with Rosanna Scotto, Harold Ford Jr., Jesse Waters [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=4.76s)]
*  and Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=9.84s)]
*  It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=11.48s)]
*  Okay President Trump ripping Biden's handlers as we get shocking new revelations on the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=19.92s)]
*  decline of the former president, including some details about those in his inner circle [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=24.52s)]
*  and how they shielded a frail president from scrutiny. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=29.44s)]
*  President Trump coming in hot on this growing scandal, posting this quote, Joe Biden was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=32.72s)]
*  not for open borders. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=37.1s)]
*  He never talked about open borders where criminals of all kinds, shapes and sizes can flow into [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  our country at will. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=43.74s)]
*  It was the people that knew he was cognitively impaired and that took over the auto pen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=44.96s)]
*  They stole the presidency of the United States and put us in great danger. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=51.14s)]
*  This is treason at the highest level, end quote. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=55.28s)]
*  And now one of the authors behind this new bombshell book is speaking out about a staged [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=58.06s)]
*  Biden town hall that was so bad his campaign couldn't even use it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  This fake town hall was in order to film it so they could make it into campaign commercials. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=68.3s)]
*  They filled it in, they filmed it in Delaware with supporters. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  But Joe Biden at this point, this is the spring of 2024, Joe Biden's town hall, which was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=76.26s)]
*  closed to press, was so bad that campaign officials determined that it was not usable [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=80.62s)]
*  for a campaign commercial. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=86.54s)]
*  Some people say this was because Joe Biden was incoherent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=87.74s)]
*  He could not really articulate his thoughts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=91.02s)]
*  Some people just said like the lighting was bad. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=93.72s)]
*  That was sort of the two points of view. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=95.8s)]
*  And if that wasn't shocking enough, Dick Tapper claims Hunter Biden was basically acting like [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=99.58s)]
*  the chief of staff. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  Hunter was driving the decision making for the family in a way that people, he was almost [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  like a chief of staff. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=112.14s)]
*  I think he is provably demonstrably unethical, sleazy and prone to horrible decisions. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=113.14s)]
*  Tell me how you really feel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=120.02s)]
*  Well I mean, just look at the record. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=122.66s)]
*  I mean, after his brother died, he cheated on his wife with his brother's widow and then [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=125.42s)]
*  got her addicted to crack. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=129.58s)]
*  Well it wasn't just Hunter in charge. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=132.3s)]
*  As one Biden insider put it, quote, five people were running the country and Joe Biden was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=133.98s)]
*  at best a senior member of the board. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=139.22s)]
*  Okay, Jesse, I want to start off here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=142.7s)]
*  I've gotten through a lot of the book but not all of it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=144.61999999999998s)]
*  But there's kind of this theme where people were so afraid about President Trump becoming [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=146.78s)]
*  president again that they were willing to kind of look the other way on this Biden stuff. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  But it ended up being a self-fulfilling prophecy because propping him up to the last minute [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=155.1s)]
*  gave them President Trump again. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=159.06s)]
*  For maybe three terms in a row, Shannon. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=161.17999999999998s)]
*  I don't think that's a conspiracy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=163.78s)]
*  I'm going to vote again and again and again. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  So he couldn't get through a fake town hall and he couldn't get through debate prep, but [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=167.89999999999998s)]
*  they sent him out anyway and he got slaughtered. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  Permission to make an analogy? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=175.14s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=176.14s)]
*  This is like a quarterback who can't even make it through practice. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=177.14s)]
*  Can't even make it through seven on seven, Harold, non-contact. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  He's turning the ball over, he's forgetting the plays, he's limping around. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  And what do they do? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=186.82s)]
*  They sent him out on Sunday and he gets knocked unconscious on the first drive. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=188.18s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  You got to send in the backup. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=195.98s)]
*  Now why don't they have a better backup? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=197.62s)]
*  Well because the GM never drafted a quarterback or never signed anybody in free agency to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=199.3s)]
*  compete for the starting job. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  So what do you do in the off season? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  You fire the GM. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  Who's the GM? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=210.46s)]
*  Jill. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=211.94s)]
*  That's who is calling the shots. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  Jill and his son Hunter. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=214.62s)]
*  So the woman the President was sleeping with is running the country and then his son who's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=216.94s)]
*  recovering from a crack addiction is running the country and he's filming a documentary [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  during the whole thing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=227.22000000000003s)]
*  I cannot wait to see it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=228.22s)]
*  So Jake, this is where he's fake. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=229.78s)]
*  He comes out now and he says, Hunter Biden is a sleazy criminal with too much access [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=232.22s)]
*  to his pop. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=236.94s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=238.86s)]
*  And when I said it, he called me cruel and a conspiracy theorist. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=240.54s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=244.92s)]
*  The people who were wrong about Biden get book deals. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=246.78s)]
*  What are the people who were right about Biden get? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=250.74s)]
*  What do we get? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=253.7s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=255.02s)]
*  I want an apology and I want a written apology because I want to frame it and I want to put [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=256.02s)]
*  it on my wall. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=260.38s)]
*  Greg knows I don't collect art. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=261.5s)]
*  I collect apology. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=262.9s)]
*  That is true. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=263.9s)]
*  So this is what they're saying. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=264.9s)]
*  They're doing the cover up. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=266.02s)]
*  All the people closest to Joe Biden were duped. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  The anchors who interviewed him in person, the politicians who met with them, the reporters [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  who traveled with them on the plane were all duped. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=275.7s)]
*  But the millions of Americans who were watching him on TV from their couches, they knew that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=279.44s)]
*  he was shot. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=285.82s)]
*  No, everybody knew they're just pretending to find out now with this book as an excuse [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=287.18s)]
*  while they cash in. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=293.32s)]
*  Well, and Harold, the book talks about a lot of people who have regrets that they didn't [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=294.32s)]
*  say something before, probably because they ended with this disaster in the election in [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=298.68s)]
*  the fall, but they had knowledge and they 200 plus people have talked to them. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=302.82s)]
*  Now it's a question now that a lot of people that are running for 2028 Democrats are going [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  to have to answer and they're starting to be asked, what did you know? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=311.32s)]
*  When? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=315.06s)]
*  I mean, that's going to be part of the vetting process for them moving forward. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=316.06s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=318.66s)]
*  Glad you're here. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=319.66s)]
*  I'd say a couple of things. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=320.66s)]
*  First, the story is not getting any better. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=321.66s)]
*  A lot of this Jesse said very well and Greg will say when he speaks, remind us as well [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=325.06s)]
*  as he should. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=329.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=330.3s)]
*  That there are many around this table who were saying this, saying these things for [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=331.3s)]
*  a while. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=334.5s)]
*  It does strike me as a bit incredulous if not insulting to hear people whom are covering [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=335.6s)]
*  this now to say that they had these kind of opinions but weren't saying this during [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=341.26s)]
*  the campaign. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=345.7s)]
*  They have every right to say that, but they should not be so sanctimonious about it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=346.7s)]
*  I don't know when we stop talking about it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=352.18s)]
*  I know there's a U.S. Senator who wants to do an investigation into the White House and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=356.06s)]
*  this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=359.34s)]
*  I don't know what we are trying to get at and if we're trying to get at something noble, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=360.34s)]
*  I'm willing to say we should do it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=363.86s)]
*  But the president has to, former president will have to live with this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=366.18s)]
*  Those around him will have to live with this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=369.42s)]
*  I know there's a cabinet member who said five people were running the country. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=370.82s)]
*  Why didn't they come forward? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=374.06s)]
*  I think the question for me will be more so why didn't they all come forward if they believed [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=375.62s)]
*  that he was not fit to be president or they just believed that they were jealous or that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=380.02s)]
*  person jealous, he or she, that they were not in that room or were they saying it because [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=384.5s)]
*  they thought that the president couldn't run the country. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=388.06s)]
*  But at some point, we should realize the American people recognize this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=390.74s)]
*  They rejected him and Kamala Harris and put back into the White House the person whom [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=394.86s)]
*  he beat four years earlier. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=398.58s)]
*  So that's where I stand on it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=400.42s)]
*  Well and the book goes back to describe that there were people who were concerned as far [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=402.3s)]
*  back as 2015 that the loss of Bo was really debilitating to him. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=406.38s)]
*  So Greg, that begs the question, if they were concerned about him all those years ago, was [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  the idea just to get him elected in 24 and then do the switcheroo with the vice president? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=414.66s)]
*  Did they really think he could go another four years? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=419.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  And I also, I don't want an apology. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=423.5s)]
*  I want money. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=426.12s)]
*  Money plus apology. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=427.62s)]
*  I want 10% of Jake's book. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=429.5s)]
*  10% for the little guy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=431.34s)]
*  Yeah, 10%. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=432.94s)]
*  Very good. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=433.94s)]
*  But you know what else I want? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=434.94s)]
*  The little guy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=437.5s)]
*  I want the town hall tape. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=438.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  Let's release the town hall tape. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  Don't treat it like a Pamela Anderson sex tape where I got to spend days looking for [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=443.38s)]
*  it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  Somebody's got it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=448.41999999999996s)]
*  I want it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=449.41999999999996s)]
*  And then maybe we'll discuss reparations. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=450.97999999999996s)]
*  We need Biden reparations. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=453.94s)]
*  We need the ones that Greg likes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=458.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=459.7s)]
*  Finally. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=460.7s)]
*  We found some. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=461.7s)]
*  I can't help but think that all this went to hell when Hunter quit doing crack. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=462.7s)]
*  Things were great when he was on drugs and then he stopped. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=468.02s)]
*  Everything just fell apart. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=470.64s)]
*  The truth is, the people actually running the country are guilty of identity theft. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=471.94s)]
*  Every day for four years, these imposters took power that they weren't entitled to. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, you're right. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=482.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not about these guys. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=483.86s)]
*  These guys weren't duped. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=484.86s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden wasn't even competent enough to sign away his power of attorney. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=486.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, they preferred to keep it that way. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=491.26000000000005s)]
*  It was like they liked him docile like a drugged sex slave so they could have their way with [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=493.78000000000003s)]
*  the American people. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=499.90000000000003s)]
*  About Hunter Biden. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=501.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he's chief of staff. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  His staff. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=505.70000000000005s)]
*  These journalists had a juicy story. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=506.90000000000003s)]
*  Cocaine in the White House. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=510.14000000000004s)]
*  While Hunter is there. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=513.02s)]
*  How could you not pursue that story? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=514.54s)]
*  You got drugs. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=516.38s)]
*  You got power. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=517.38s)]
*  You got intrigue. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=518.38s)]
*  You got sex. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=519.38s)]
*  And yet the reporters didn't stop to put down their lattes. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=520.38s)]
*  Nothing to see here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=522.26s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=523.26s)]
*  Hunter. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=524.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=525.26s)]
*  Now you say Hunter is the nexus of power and there was a cover up. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=526.26s)]
*  You were there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=529.14s)]
*  You could have uncovered it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=530.14s)]
*  But no one and no one was stopping you from doing that story except you. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=532.18s)]
*  And I think the big confession is this is about personal bias. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  And people are very, very embarrassed to admit their bias about Trump is what drove [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=542.18s)]
*  this story. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=546.7399999999999s)]
*  And now I'm going to save you, Harold. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=547.7399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to create your presidential campaign. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=549.5s)]
*  I'm going to get you elected. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=552.18s)]
*  The biggest scandal in Democrat history is this, but it's also the solution to one problem. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=554.0999999999999s)]
*  What is the Democrat party lacking? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  They're lacking a lane. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=560.3s)]
*  They don't have issues. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=561.8599999999999s)]
*  They don't have leaders, but they lack a lane. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=562.8599999999999s)]
*  OK, so the one person, the one person, Harold Ford, who leads the fight to expose the secret [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=564.7399999999999s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, who is the Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic candidate [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=571.42s)]
*  who is the Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=576.42s)]
*  candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, who is the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=580.86s)]
*  Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=584.9399999999999s)]
*  who is the Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=589.4599999999999s)]
*  candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, who is the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=593.9s)]
*  Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, who is the Democratic candidate, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=598.18s)]
*  to uncover the secret. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=601.34s)]
*  Forty six will win back the Democrat Party's trust. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=602.82s)]
*  You don't have any trust. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  This is the lane you are looking for herald for. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=609.46s)]
*  And maybe Dean don't Claus that she'll VP picks since he was one of the only ones [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=613.02s)]
*  out there willing to raise these questions. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=616.6s)]
*  Rosanna costs)] [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=619.12s)]
*  So you'll see, this was written before we heard about the president's cancer diagnosis, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=620.12s)]
*  but there's a little tidbit in the book where it talks about the doctor that is treating [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  him was so close to him. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=627.36s)]
*  are questions in the book about whether he was too close [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=629.12s)]
*  to objectively treat him in a more aggressive way. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=631.4s)]
*  Not with respect to this cancer. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=635.24s)]
*  Clearly they didn't know anything about that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=636.42s)]
*  when they're writing the book. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=637.96s)]
*  But it raises questions about whether so many people [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=639.34s)]
*  so close to him just weren't able [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=641.48s)]
*  to do their jobs objectively. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=642.96s)]
*  Well, we're finding out House of Cards [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=644.48s)]
*  is nothing like the House of Biden, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=646.88s)]
*  with Dr. Jill and the lead [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=649.22s)]
*  and Jill making special appearances. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=651.08s)]
*  We now find out in this book, right, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=653.2s)]
*  that she is the most powerful first lady in history, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=655.46s)]
*  the defender. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=659.46s)]
*  I don't have contacts in the White House under Joe Biden, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=661.36s)]
*  but something got my attention [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=664.7s)]
*  when Joe Biden and Dr. Jill went to Normandy last year, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=667.7s)]
*  and they were there for the D-Day ceremonies. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=672.5400000000001s)]
*  And Dr. Jill was back and forth on a plane, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=676.0600000000001s)]
*  on a military plane, from Normandy to Wilmington [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=679.6s)]
*  for a hunters' trial back to Normandy on our tax dollar, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=683.78s)]
*  even though the Democratic Party said [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=688.86s)]
*  that they were going to repay [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=690.86s)]
*  what they would pay for commercial flight. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=693.14s)]
*  Listen, Jill was not just standing by her man, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=695.06s)]
*  she was standing in for her man. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=698.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWIvSK1bi8&t=701.78s)]
