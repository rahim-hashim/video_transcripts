# 'The Five': Biden teases comeback as AOC, Bernie trash Dems on anti-Trump tour
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c)
*  Alright, moderates, watch out. The socialists are stepping up to fill the leadership vacuum in the Democrat Party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=0.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders and AOC are hitting the road with their fighting oligarchy tour in red and blue states, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=5.38s)]
*  taking aim at the usual suspects like Elon Musk and President Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=11.52s)]
*  But they are also throwing some shade at their own watch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=15.38s)]
*  We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=19.38s)]
*  I want you to look at every level of office around and support Democrats who fight, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=24.22s)]
*  because those are the ones who can actually beat Republicans. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=30.46s)]
*  You got guys playing defense, but they also play offense. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=34.14s)]
*  Our offense is to remind us all and every person in this country, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=38.14s)]
*  we are the wealthiest nation in the history of this world. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=43.94s)]
*  But the moderate wing of the party is doing their best to counter AOC. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=49.68s)]
*  Democratic Michigan Senator Alyssa Slotkin fired this shot. Listen closely. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=53.06s)]
*  I can't just chain myself to the White House and become an activist full-time, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=57.96s)]
*  because you and others here are going to call me for things that you need. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=63.96s)]
*  All of those things require me to be more than just an AOC. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=68.54s)]
*  Everyone you mentioned has a lot of words, but what have they actually done to change the situation with Donald Trump? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=73.54s)]
*  But if all else fails, the Bidens are looking for a comeback. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=82.08s)]
*  NBC News reporting that former President Joe Biden and his wife, former First Lady Jill Biden, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=86.08s)]
*  have been putting out some feelers to Democratic leaders and saying, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=92.58s)]
*  look, you know, we can help you. We can do fundraising. We can campaign. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=96.08s)]
*  We can do anything else necessary to help Democrats recover the lost ground. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=100.08s)]
*  And boy, it's lost, Janine. It is down to about 29, 27 percent. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  So they've been in Delaware, I guess, for a little while. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=111.1s)]
*  He's going back and forth to Washington, D.C. on the Amtrak, I know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=114.1s)]
*  But they're starting to put out some feelers. You know, you guys, I think you need some help from the two of us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=118.1s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if no one calls. And I don't think they should sit and wait beside their phone. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=122.1s)]
*  Look, Joe Biden and Jill, I think in the end, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=128.1s)]
*  the mess that happened with Kamala Harris is going to be attributed to Joe Biden and to Jill. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=132.1s)]
*  OK, but but having said all that, I really want to talk about the message. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=138.1s)]
*  They want someone who fights. They want someone who does actions, according to Alisa, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=142.1s)]
*  at least Slotkin actions over words. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=148.1s)]
*  And, you know, does that mean that you don't talk about things that, you know, you get out there and you torch things [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=153.1s)]
*  or you burn things up? I'm not sure what that means. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=161.1s)]
*  And plus, I think it's kind of crazy that they want to fight an oligarchy when I think it was Fetterman the other day said, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=164.1s)]
*  I don't think the Democrats should use the word oligarchy. The American people don't know what it means. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=171.1s)]
*  And I don't think they know what it means, especially Bernie Sanders, because he's a socialist. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=175.1s)]
*  And the truth is that, you know, a socialist control pretty much every aspect of your society. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=180.1s)]
*  And they want to fight the oligarchy. I mean, I don't quite get it all. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=185.1s)]
*  But this is a whole bunch of nothing from a whole bunch of nobodies because Donald Trump broke the Democrat Party. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=189.1s)]
*  They don't have a message. They don't have a messenger. They just want to fight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=196.1s)]
*  They don't know what they want to fight about. Half of them are happy about what's going on with the torching of the Tesla vehicles. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=201.1s)]
*  Nobody's coming out against it other than Ro Khanna and maybe Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=208.1s)]
*  They are they are in they're in the middle of an abyss. They don't know what to do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=212.1s)]
*  And, you know, I think in the end, the party is going to be split. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=218.1s)]
*  They say they have like they're like the Republican Party when the Tea Party came in and kind of fractured it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=221.1s)]
*  They felt like two tea parties. They don't know who they are or what they're about. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=226.1s)]
*  And, you know, if the final note, if AOC wants to say they're the party of the working Americans, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=230.1s)]
*  don't let her forget that she wouldn't allow Amazon to come to Queens. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=238.1s)]
*  That there were 25,000 jobs that would have been available for a billion dollars in lost wages, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=242.1s)]
*  four billion dollars in additional business to local businesses. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=249.1s)]
*  Don't even use the word AOC. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=254.1s)]
*  Jess, I have the same question when she talks about fighting, wanting someone who fights and fighting the oligarchy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=257.1s)]
*  What does what does that actually mean to you as you hear it? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=265.1s)]
*  It means that we need representatives that want to be out there with the people holding rallies and town halls. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=268.1s)]
*  People who are talking about what's going on in the administration, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=274.1s)]
*  the tradeoffs of, you know, Trump wanting trillions in tax cuts for people who earn a ton of money [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=279.1s)]
*  and that they're going to come and cut your Medicaid. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=283.1s)]
*  She is talking about people that are open and honest and responsive and people who admit what's going on, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=286.1s)]
*  the harsh realities of what's going on in some blue cities, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=292.1s)]
*  which is she had been talking about it and this week I've mentioned it every day. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=295.1s)]
*  But as recline and Derek Thompson's new book, Abundance, is coursing through the conversation in Democratic circles. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=299.1s)]
*  So, you know, AOC and Bernie can call them radicals. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=305.1s)]
*  They're Democratic socialists. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=309.1s)]
*  They're talking about things like, you know, it should be a basic human right to have good health care [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=311.1s)]
*  and to have the right to a good education and a roof over your head and be able to make enough money to put food on the table. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=315.1s)]
*  That's not where, listen, Democratic socialist is the left side of the party for sure, but they are bringing in crowds. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=322.1s)]
*  He has more people showing up to his rallies now than even when he was running for president. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=329.1s)]
*  And he had big crowds at that moment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=332.1s)]
*  The reason, though, that this isn't a Tea Party movement within our party, at least at this point, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=334.1s)]
*  is that you're not seeing progressives winning their elections. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=340.1s)]
*  They're not primaring moderates and winning it all. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=343.1s)]
*  Moderates were hugely successful in the 2024 election on the congressional and Senate level, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=345.1s)]
*  which is part of what Elisa Slotkin is talking about. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=349.1s)]
*  She won Michigan as a moderate dem when Donald Trump won as well. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=352.1s)]
*  But Pritzker is getting on the road and these town halls are huge. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=356.1s)]
*  Eight hundred for Pat Ryan, thirteen hundred for Jason Crow. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=359.1s)]
*  That's what fighting is. It's showing up. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=362.1s)]
*  Tea Party, Jesse. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=364.1s)]
*  You know, when I think of the Tea Party, I think about smaller government and less regulation and lower taxes [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=366.1s)]
*  that pushed the Republican Party back to those roots. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=372.1s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out, you know, if that I mean, do they want more government, larger government? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=375.1s)]
*  Is that where a fringy Tea Party would push the Democrat Party? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=380.1s)]
*  Well, we know what they want and no one wants it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=384.1s)]
*  It was DEI, it was trans surgeries, it was cash bail. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=387.1s)]
*  It's been rejected and it's all based in cities. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=391.1s)]
*  The Tea Party was a national movement. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=394.1s)]
*  It was intergenerational and they won massive midterms. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=397.1s)]
*  And it wasn't just in the House. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=400.1s)]
*  They put Tea Party people in the Senate and Trump came out of the Tea Party. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=401.1s)]
*  So I don't see a Tea Party yet, but it could be fun to watch. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=406.1s)]
*  I'm afraid what it's going to look like if Democrats fight harder. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=409.1s)]
*  They shot him. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=414.1s)]
*  Yeah, they find him five hundred million dollars. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=415.1s)]
*  They tried to strip him off the ballot. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=419.1s)]
*  They impeached him twice. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=421.1s)]
*  They had a guy with a gun show up to a Supreme Court justice's house after they accused him of rape. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=423.1s)]
*  I mean, literally, what more can you guys do? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=428.1s)]
*  The only thing that you haven't done is shut down the government. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=430.1s)]
*  Be my guest. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=434.1s)]
*  Because then we'll find out who is really an essential worker. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=436.1s)]
*  But you're right, Jessica. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=439.1s)]
*  You actually define fighting better than I've ever heard anybody. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=441.1s)]
*  Because right now your party thinks fighting is like throwing a cane at Trump. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=443.1s)]
*  That's not fighting with a little sign. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=446.1s)]
*  That's nothing. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=449.1s)]
*  I think what you guys need to do is recruit, raise money, and win the midterms. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=450.1s)]
*  And then you can start doing things. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=455.1s)]
*  We had our strongest grassroots fundraising month, actually. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=457.1s)]
*  I'm so excited for you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=459.1s)]
*  Well, maybe Kamala will come in and defend it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=461.1s)]
*  Fighting the oligarchy, Greg. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=463.1s)]
*  Is that resonating with Americans? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=465.1s)]
*  How long are we going to ignore the big story here? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=467.1s)]
*  AOC saying fart. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=471.1s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=474.1s)]
*  You have me on this show and you don't even bring up the fact that she says fart? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=475.1s)]
*  That's from hanging around Bernie, you know what I mean? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=479.1s)]
*  Baby, that message truly stinks. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=482.1s)]
*  But yeah, Bernie and AOC, do you think they're banging the wrong drum here? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=485.1s)]
*  No, the message. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=490.1s)]
*  For example, I've never actually said the word oligarchy out loud until today. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=492.1s)]
*  Oligarchy, oligarchy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=497.1s)]
*  What's next? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=499.1s)]
*  Plutocracies? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=500.1s)]
*  Shall we target plutocracies on behalf of the proletariat? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=501.1s)]
*  I mean, that might make the purple man buns in the quad swoon. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=504.1s)]
*  But it ain't going to fly in the living room, kiddos. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=508.1s)]
*  When they talk about fighting, they're saying they need a Trump. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=511.1s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=514.1s)]
*  But I'm going to define what an oligarchy is and where you can find one. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=515.1s)]
*  It means government by the few. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=519.1s)]
*  So the only way an oligarchy can exist is if it's non-transparent. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=521.1s)]
*  But what's the most transparent government in history? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=526.1s)]
*  The one that shows you where your money's being spent? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=529.1s)]
*  The one that releases files on assassinations? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=531.1s)]
*  The one that answers every single question you ask them? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=534.1s)]
*  The one that tweets or posts every single action and tells you ahead of time [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=539.1s)]
*  what they're going to do. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=544.1s)]
*  If Trump, the administration, is an oligarchy, it's the worst one ever. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=545.1s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=550.1s)]
*  If it was, he would show you how it's done. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=552.1s)]
*  He'd go, oh, yeah, this is an oligarchy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=554.1s)]
*  Come on over here. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=556.1s)]
*  I'll show you what it is. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=557.1s)]
*  So what do you find real oligarchies? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=558.1s)]
*  They're at about three or four places. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=560.1s)]
*  Unions, they're oligarchies. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=562.1s)]
*  They maintain the illusion of democracy and collectivism. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=564.1s)]
*  But it's just elites up top who run and maintain total control [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=567.1s)]
*  because that's the survival. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=572.1s)]
*  A union is now like a political party. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=573.1s)]
*  Biden's White House, complete non-transparency. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=575.1s)]
*  We still don't know who ran the country. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=579.1s)]
*  What's the trademark of oligarchy? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=581.1s)]
*  Secrecy. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=583.1s)]
*  The White House was covered up. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=584.1s)]
*  It's the only president we ever had that was a cutout. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=586.1s)]
*  You know, nameless few directing it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=589.1s)]
*  That's an oligarchy. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=591.1s)]
*  Then you look at Hollywood. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=592.1s)]
*  You look at the legacy media. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=593.1s)]
*  They're all oligarchies. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=595.1s)]
*  They're run by the few. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=596.1s)]
*  And you know who's outside the oligarchy? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=597.1s)]
*  The right. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=599.1s)]
*  We're not in it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=600.1s)]
*  I think they are banging. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=601.1s)]
*  They're banging. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=602.1s)]
*  They're definitely banging. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=603.1s)]
*  They're wrong drum. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=604.1s)]
*  They're wrong drum. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=605.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=606.1s)]
*  And they're farting. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=607.1s)]
*  A farting couple is a happy couple. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=608.1s)]
*  It's probably true. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=609.1s)]
*  I'm going to try to shake that image from my mind. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=610.1s)]
*  I'm going to try to shake that image from my mind. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ICdlkwh9c&t=626.1s)]
