# Gutfeld: Biden gave a 'strong speech'
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0)
*  Hello, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro, along with Jessica Tarlaw, Brian Kilmeade, Dana Perino and Greg [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=5.64s)]
*  Gutfeld. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=11.28s)]
*  It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  President Biden finally doing what he should have done days ago, unequivocally supporting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=21.8s)]
*  Israel, and forcefully condemning Hamas. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=26.32s)]
*  There are moments in this life, and I mean this literally, when the pure unadulterated [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=29.6s)]
*  evil is unleashed on this world. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  The people of Israel lived through one such moment this weekend. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=40.8s)]
*  The bloody hands of the terrorist organization Hamas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=46.64s)]
*  Women raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=51.28s)]
*  Hid their fear for hours and hours desperately trying to keep their children quiet, to avoid [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=56.32s)]
*  drawing attention. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=62.52s)]
*  We must be crystal clear. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  We stand with Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=66.04s)]
*  We will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=68.68s)]
*  and respond to this attack. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=73.4s)]
*  President Biden and the White House confirming that 14 Americans have been slaughtered by [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=76.56s)]
*  Hamas and 20 U.S. citizens are missing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=81.06s)]
*  And also saying that Americans are being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=85.16s)]
*  The families of the victims kidnapped by the terror group are begging Biden to act. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=89.28s)]
*  And they are responsible to bring the U.S. citizens back home safe and sound. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=95.24s)]
*  We expect nothing less from the U.S. administration and from President Biden. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=101.96s)]
*  I'm asking the U.S. not to take a backseat, to do what they can to make this end for us [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=107.36s)]
*  as soon as possible to become family. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  Whole again. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  The president showing some leadership today. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=121.4s)]
*  But where has this version of Joe Biden been? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=124.28s)]
*  Biden practically sat silent for two days without any on-camera public statements as [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  Israel dealt with the worst terror attack in its history. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=132.84s)]
*  His White House was forced to clean up after him and post tweets that claim Biden was quote [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=136.84s)]
*  receiving regular updates on the situation from his national security team. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=142.56s)]
*  All right Dana, I'll go to you first. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=148.32s)]
*  The president promised that the United States would stand by Israel 100%. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=152.84s)]
*  Number one, why did it take four days for him to say this? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=158.72s)]
*  And number two, how long do you think this promise will be good for given the fact that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=162.4s)]
*  urban warfare, which is where we're headed in Gaza, can be extremely long and extremely [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=168.08s)]
*  difficult? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, I thought his comments today, once he finally made them, had some moral clarity [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  to them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  I think there was a missed opportunity to not talk about Iran, but to talk about good [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  versus evil, or stand with Israel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=184.08s)]
*  And you could quibble with maybe you could say this, maybe you could say that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=186.84s)]
*  He doesn't often do that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  Give public comments right away. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=191.8s)]
*  Think back to the Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=193.44s)]
*  There was a period of about 48 hours, maybe 72 hours, where he was silent during all of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=195.36s)]
*  that withdrawal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=200.36s)]
*  And we kept saying, why isn't the president speaking? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=201.36s)]
*  I don't know why he is so slow to do that, because I imagine that what he said today [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=203.4s)]
*  is probably what he thought initially. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  Perhaps their internal process is one that it just takes them a little bit of time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=211.28s)]
*  Another thing that I would have made very clear is that any Palestinian killed in this [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=215.72000000000003s)]
*  response, they are the victims of Hamas as well, not the Israelis. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=223.96s)]
*  And I don't know if that can help some of the public perception, but social media, if [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=230.16s)]
*  you see some of these disgusting excuses being made about Hamas, that is just deplorable. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=236.16s)]
*  And it is happening kind of all around the world. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=244.68s)]
*  One of the things that was shocking to me today was to do a poll, to show a poll from [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  in 2013, in the Democratic Party, 55% of people in the Democratic Party 10 years ago supported [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=251.44s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=257.2s)]
*  Today it's only 38%. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=258.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=260.04s)]
*  And what is the responsibility of the leader of the free world, the leader of the Democrats, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=261.12s)]
*  in order to help try to turn that around? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=265.36s)]
*  But the Iran peace was missing today. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=267.48s)]
*  It's not going to go away. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=269.6s)]
*  The other thing that's happening is they can delay him getting out there and making a statement, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=271.96s)]
*  We all are seeing, everyone in the world is seeing exactly what Hamas did here in real [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  time because of social media. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  So the old tactic of waiting to talk doesn't seem to work that well anymore. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=284.26s)]
*  Brian, you know, as Dana mentioned, missing from Biden's speech was Iran. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=289.23999999999995s)]
*  But Biden, it's the Wall Street Journal is the one that told us that Iran was behind [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=295.58s)]
*  it, orchestrating it, providing weapons training, and yet we don't hear this from the administration. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=300.2s)]
*  But one of the things Biden said was to any country thinking of taking advantage, don't. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=306.8s)]
*  And he was very firm. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  But didn't Iran already do that? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=313.66s)]
*  Yeah, I guess he specifically was thinking about Hezbollah, you know, hey, if you're [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=315.92s)]
*  going to start bombing in the north or if you're going to start with Syria with those [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=319.32s)]
*  renegade outlets there that basically has become a terror state, there's no doubt about [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  it, Iran played a role. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=327.76s)]
*  Calculated, the president calls out Iran directly, we could be looking at a major war. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=329.04s)]
*  So he's being calculated. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=333.58000000000004s)]
*  But there's ways to insinuate we know exactly what's going on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=334.76s)]
*  You know what I would love to have seen, Judge? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=337.92s)]
*  I would love to have seen him say, listen, I gave you guys a chance. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  After maximum pressure campaign, I thought Trump was all wrong. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=343.48s)]
*  The previous administration was all wrong. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=346.28s)]
*  I gave you a chance. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=347.64s)]
*  I gave you, I met in Oman, you weren't supposed to know about that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=348.8s)]
*  I released sanctions. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=352.36s)]
*  I allowed you to pump out more oil. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=353.4s)]
*  We saw all that happen. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=355.26s)]
*  And now I realize it's a mistake. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=356.84s)]
*  Back to maximum pressure. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=358.8s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  And the Washington Post expanded on what the Wall Street Journal said. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  The Washington Post said planning began a year ago. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=364.36s)]
*  And not only did Iran help tactically, they helped set up weapons manufacturing plants. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=366.76s)]
*  And Hezbollah pitched in. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=372.38s)]
*  What was so crazy about the Wall Street Journal story, what was it, 24 hours after? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=373.84s)]
*  We found out that they were having biweekly meetings in Beirut. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=378.02s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=380.88s)]
*  Who knew this? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=381.88s)]
*  I would find a way to call up reporters, not threaten them, just say, listen, this is a [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=383.12s)]
*  huge problem. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=388.0s)]
*  How the hell did you find that out? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=389.4s)]
*  After all, I don't see that being a threat. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=391.96s)]
*  Just say, if you're comfortable giving the sources, I would love to confirm this, because [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=393.64s)]
*  this has got to stop right now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=397.56s)]
*  All right, Jessica, you know, Biden didn't demand that Hamas return those American hostages [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  or demand that not a hair on the body of any American be touched going forward. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  Are you confident that the president has the backs of Americans over there? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=411.91999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I've seen bipartisan support and adulation for this speech. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=417.72s)]
*  I mean, there are people on social media who are conservatives, very pro-Israel, saying [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=423.56s)]
*  that this is a speech that Barack Obama would not have made when he was in office, that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  this was one of the more pro-Israel speeches you could ever have envisioned. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=433.16s)]
*  So I'm sorry if maybe he didn't say exactly the words that you wanted in the order that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=437.04s)]
*  you wanted them, but his message was unequivocally clear. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=443.22s)]
*  I would add to that that I think that he has been clear since day one of this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=446.86s)]
*  He spoke to the American people on Saturday afternoon. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=450.46s)]
*  He came out and he said without equivocation, we stand with Israel. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=453.56s)]
*  There was no talk of the Palestinians making sure that there's no loss of life in the Gaza [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=457.78s)]
*  Strip. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=463.06s)]
*  Said we have your back in terms of what he's been doing then in the interim days when he's [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=464.06s)]
*  been disappointing you, I guess, that he's not on camera. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=467.68s)]
*  There was a joint statement that came out last night signed by the U.S., France, Germany, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=470.34s)]
*  coming together, speaking out in support of Israel. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=476.66s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu has thanked President Biden for his support, the Israeli ambassador to [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=480.46000000000004s)]
*  the U.S., the Israeli ambassador to the U.N. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=485.1s)]
*  The White House now lit up in the Israeli flag color, something that you upset, was [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=487.90000000000003s)]
*  upsetting you yesterday. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  So I don't really get, besides kind of partisan bickering, what the problem is with how Joe [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=494.3s)]
*  Biden has addressed this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=501.04s)]
*  If it's good enough for Netanyahu, it should be good enough for you. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=502.18s)]
*  He's got no choice. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=506.86s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=507.86s)]
*  He's got no choice because we're their number one benefactor. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=508.86s)]
*  So Israel, they have no choice but to praise, just like Zelensky, has to say thanks for [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=511.34000000000003s)]
*  giving me just enough to survive, not to win, because we are their number one benefactor. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=515.3000000000001s)]
*  I will say this, the one thing problem is Obama and Biden have one thing in common. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=519.78s)]
*  They despise Netanyahu. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=525.62s)]
*  Remember, he was whispered, told in Sarkozy, I have to deal with Netanyahu every day. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=526.62s)]
*  He still hasn't invited him to the White House, never congratulated him on the right. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=530.38s)]
*  He did invite him to the White House last month, and now there are people like this [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=533.3399999999999s)]
*  former Israeli defense minister who is calling on the opposition people to not form an emergency [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=536.54s)]
*  government with Netanyahu that he needs to resign. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu's problems are at home. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=544.26s)]
*  They are not with us. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=545.62s)]
*  He does not like, they do not like each other. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=547.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they don't, and Obama didn't like him. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  And the bottom line is there's nobody better than Netanyahu in a situation like this. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=552.42s)]
*  In a situation like this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=557.0999999999999s)]
*  How do you negotiate or protect Americans, Craig, when the Israelis are being used as [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=558.64s)]
*  human shields? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=564.12s)]
*  I don't know, I'm not an expert in that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=566.08s)]
*  I will say that I thought it was a strong, a strong speech. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=567.64s)]
*  And you can get, you know, petty about the words, I guess, but there's a lot of problems [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=573.74s)]
*  with this administration. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=578.48s)]
*  That wasn't a problem. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=580.56s)]
*  I mean, my bar is very low for Joe Biden. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=581.56s)]
*  I was relieved he didn't compare the attack to a fire in the kitchen. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=584.62s)]
*  So that was good. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=588.5s)]
*  That's a win in my book. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=589.5s)]
*  However, it's not like I was fortified or empowered by it because I guess it's just [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=591.22s)]
*  words right now and I'm waiting for the deeds. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=599.04s)]
*  I thought the words were strong, but I always go by the deeds. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=601.34s)]
*  So we have to wait and see. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=604.26s)]
*  I know a lot of people were saying, why did he mention Iran? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=605.94s)]
*  I don't think that was the problem. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=608.7s)]
*  I think that right now we have to talk about our vulnerability, right? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=611.54s)]
*  Our immediate threat. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=615.98s)]
*  And we have one. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=617.5s)]
*  It's called the southern border and it's unprotected. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=618.66s)]
*  And it would have been nice for him to say, we're going to close, we're going to, you [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=621.86s)]
*  know, treat it like we did with COVID, right? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=625.06s)]
*  We got to close the border. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=628.06s)]
*  We got to get troops down there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=629.14s)]
*  We got to treat this as a serious threat to the United States. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=631.22s)]
*  I think that this is a stark, scary moment for the West. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=634.86s)]
*  You know, after 9-11, we were devastated, but there was never a concern that we weren't [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=639.86s)]
*  being led by a team of people with fortitude and will. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=644.4599999999999s)]
*  I feel that right now we're dealing with a leadership deficit. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=648.62s)]
*  And I'm giving him credit for that, for that speech. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=652.4599999999999s)]
*  Albeit it was a couple of days late and he could have done it instead of going to a barbecue. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=655.06s)]
*  But right now it's not like we're at baseline. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=660.18s)]
*  I feel like we're in a hole leadership wise. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  And I don't think we can pretend that we're in a good place right now. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=666.18s)]
*  And I think we have to wait and see tonight. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=670.02s)]
*  It hasn't been a change. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=672.3s)]
*  All we're getting is bad news. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=673.46s)]
*  So I give him props for unequivocally being on the side of Israel. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=675.62s)]
*  But those are the words. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=683.3000000000001s)]
*  I want to see the deeds. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6a2RDqymF0&t=684.3000000000001s)]
