*  X, are you OK? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=0.0s)]
*  This is X. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=2.0s)]
*  And he's a great guy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=4.0s)]
*  High IQ. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=6.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and his son, Lil X, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=8.0s)]
*  showing up in the Oval Office as President Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=10.0s)]
*  signed off on some EOs [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=12.0s)]
*  backing up Doge, the world's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=14.0s)]
*  richest man dismantling the Democrat [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=16.0s)]
*  hysteria over his cost-cutting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=18.0s)]
*  operation, point by point. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=20.0s)]
*  If the people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=22.0s)]
*  cannot vote, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=24.0s)]
*  they will be decided by [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=26.0s)]
*  their elected representatives [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=28.0s)]
*  in the form of the President and the Senate [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=30.0s)]
*  and the House. Then we don't live [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=32.0s)]
*  in a democracy, we live in a bureaucracy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=34.0s)]
*  The people voted [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=36.0s)]
*  for major government [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=38.0s)]
*  reform. There should be no [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=40.0s)]
*  doubt about that. That was on the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=42.0s)]
*  campaign, the President spoke about that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=44.0s)]
*  at every rally. The people voted [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=46.0s)]
*  for major government reform [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=48.0s)]
*  and that's what people are going to get. They're going to get what they voted for. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=50.0s)]
*  It's going to be [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=52.0s)]
*  probably close to a trillion dollars. It could [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=54.0s)]
*  be close to a trillion dollars that we're going to find. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=56.0s)]
*  If you add competence and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=58.0s)]
*  caring, you'll cut the budget deficit in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=60.0s)]
*  half. And [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=62.0s)]
*  I fully expect to be scrutinized [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=64.0s)]
*  and get a daily proctology [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=66.0s)]
*  exam, basically. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=68.0s)]
*  And while Musk and Trump were artfully [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=70.0s)]
*  articulating why Doge is needed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=72.0s)]
*  to cut the federal budget deficit in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=74.0s)]
*  half, Democrats were holding their daily [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=76.0s)]
*  anti-Musk rage fest rallies [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=78.0s)]
*  and letting the F-bombs [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=80.0s)]
*  fly. I said [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=82.0s)]
*  f-bomb Trump! [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=84.0s)]
*  We are going to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=86.0s)]
*  beat. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=88.0s)]
*  I was going to say f-bomb, but no. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=90.0s)]
*  We're not. No, I'm not going to say that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=92.0s)]
*  I don't swear in public very well, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=94.0s)]
*  but we have to f-bomb Trump! [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=96.0s)]
*  Please don't tell my children that I [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=100.0s)]
*  just did that! [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=102.0s)]
*  Hey Greg, the difference between [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=104.0s)]
*  Elon Musk holding court in the Oval [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=106.0s)]
*  and the Democrats screaming outside [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=108.0s)]
*  is pretty stark. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=110.0s)]
*  Well, first you've got a guy whose [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=112.0s)]
*  kid is crawling all over him like [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=114.0s)]
*  he's a climbing wall. He's talking about [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=116.0s)]
*  waste, fraud, and abuse, and the kid's treating him [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=118.0s)]
*  like a jungle gym, yet he can handle [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=120.0s)]
*  it. Meanwhile, you've got these [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=122.0s)]
*  other, these other, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=124.0s)]
*  I don't know what you call them, but they're [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=126.0s)]
*  acting like children. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=128.0s)]
*  I think that what has happened [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=130.0s)]
*  is absent of any policies [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=132.0s)]
*  or vision, they have resorted [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=134.0s)]
*  to a consistent, nonstop [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=136.0s)]
*  tantrum. You know, I've been watching a lot [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=138.0s)]
*  of Netflix, Jesse, and every [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=140.0s)]
*  show has somebody tied to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=142.0s)]
*  a chair. Have you noticed this? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=144.0s)]
*  Every, every, like the hero [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=146.0s)]
*  or the villain is tied to a chair. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=148.0s)]
*  The Democrats in the media are tied to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=150.0s)]
*  a chair, and what they're trying [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=152.0s)]
*  to do is they're trying to turn people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=154.0s)]
*  against each other, like they're trying [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=156.0s)]
*  to get, maybe, maybe Trump will get [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=158.0s)]
*  jealous of Musk, maybe Musk will get [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=160.0s)]
*  tired of Trump, because they don't have anything [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=162.0s)]
*  to do. The problem is, they're not the hero, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=164.0s)]
*  they're the villain. They're not going to get [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=166.0s)]
*  out of that chair. And then they, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=168.0s)]
*  they're also doing these things that, oh my [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=170.0s)]
*  God, USAID, there are [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=172.0s)]
*  programs there that help [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=174.0s)]
*  people, but they neglect [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=176.0s)]
*  to point out that that's the point of the programs, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=178.0s)]
*  to point them out, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=180.0s)]
*  to say, look at these programs while [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=182.0s)]
*  you steer the attention away [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=184.0s)]
*  from the wet work you're doing in other countries. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=186.0s)]
*  They're like, the good programs [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=188.0s)]
*  are like the makeup and the skirt [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=190.0s)]
*  on the person about to roofie your [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=192.0s)]
*  drink. And that's the, that's why [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=194.0s)]
*  again, no heads of state [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=196.0s)]
*  are saying, please don't take [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=198.0s)]
*  USAID away from [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=200.0s)]
*  us. It's only the Democrats, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=202.0s)]
*  only the Democrats that are saying [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=204.0s)]
*  please don't do this to us because they know [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=206.0s)]
*  the gravy train is coming to an end. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=208.0s)]
*  And it is, I hate to say this, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=210.0s)]
*  the tip of the iceberg, but [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=212.0s)]
*  I want you, the way they're acting, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=214.0s)]
*  they are like the mafia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=216.0s)]
*  The mafia kills, what, a dozen [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=218.0s)]
*  people a year, but then, you know, they [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=220.0s)]
*  hand out toys at Christmas in Little Italy, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=222.0s)]
*  as if that's enough. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=224.0s)]
*  I would hate to see your recommended [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=226.0s)]
*  for you Netflix. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=228.0s)]
*  That would get scary. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=230.0s)]
*  You were tied to a chair. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=232.0s)]
*  Do you agree [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=234.0s)]
*  that you're tied to a chair, Richard? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=236.0s)]
*  No, I mean, am I tied now? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=238.0s)]
*  You might be in a minute. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=240.0s)]
*  No, I'm not tied [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=242.0s)]
*  to a chair, America. It was an analogy, Richard. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=244.0s)]
*  Just go along with it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=246.0s)]
*  I didn't understand, I guess I didn't get it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=248.0s)]
*  Alright, either way. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=250.0s)]
*  Listen, I do agree with Mr. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=252.0s)]
*  Moss that people, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=254.0s)]
*  you know, American people voted, anytime you [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=256.0s)]
*  vote for the opposite party in charge, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=258.0s)]
*  you want something different. But once again, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=260.0s)]
*  I think our constitution prescribes how this is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=262.0s)]
*  supposed to get done. It says that when [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=264.0s)]
*  it comes to how spending is allocated, that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=266.0s)]
*  happens via the United States [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=268.0s)]
*  Congress. They are the purse. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=270.0s)]
*  The nickname for the Congress is called the purse. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=272.0s)]
*  They are the ones who determine how money is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=274.0s)]
*  allocated, how money is spent, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=276.0s)]
*  right, not Elon Musk. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=278.0s)]
*  And so, and listen, I agree with Greg. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=280.0s)]
*  If the people do want reforms, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=282.0s)]
*  if they do want to change agencies, then it's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=284.0s)]
*  the job of the Congress to do that. I think [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=286.0s)]
*  what's very interesting in this moment is many [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=288.0s)]
*  of the things that are happening, many of the reforms are [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=290.0s)]
*  happening are things that Republican members [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=292.0s)]
*  of Congress have advocated for [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=294.0s)]
*  years, and they haven't been brave enough [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=296.0s)]
*  to go to the well and actually [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=298.0s)]
*  vote for those things to happen because they're afraid of how [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=300.0s)]
*  voters will respond to it. So now they have [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=302.0s)]
*  the richest men in the world doing their dirty [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=304.0s)]
*  work for them. It's not dirty work. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=306.0s)]
*  The fact is, they're avoiding people like you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=308.0s)]
*  Every time the Republicans [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=310.0s)]
*  No, every time... I didn't interrupt you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=312.0s)]
*  Well, no, I'm responding to you. Every time the Republicans [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=314.0s)]
*  would try to cut something, you [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=316.0s)]
*  guys would say, oh, you're going to kill grandma. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=318.0s)]
*  Well, no, no, no, but wait a second. But let's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=320.0s)]
*  just talk about one of the things that he's prescribing to cut. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=322.0s)]
*  He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=324.0s)]
*  Bureau. Here's what it's done for the folks at home. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=326.0s)]
*  It's limited overdraft fees at banks. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=328.0s)]
*  It's limited credit card late fees. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=330.0s)]
*  It's made it easier for you to switch banks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=332.0s)]
*  It's removed medical debt from people's credit reports [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=334.0s)]
*  so that you can actually get rent [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=336.0s)]
*  after you've been sick. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=338.0s)]
*  It's gone after banks who've taken advantage of people. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=340.0s)]
*  What's your argument? My argument here [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=342.0s)]
*  is these are things that have protected the American people every day [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=344.0s)]
*  and Elon wants to get rid of them because it doesn't work [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=346.0s)]
*  for millionaires and billionaires. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=348.0s)]
*  No, they did not. Yes, they did. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=350.0s)]
*  Yes, they did. I'm sure... Where were you on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=352.0s)]
*  November 5th? Donald Trump did not go to the American people [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=354.0s)]
*  and says, I want to raise your overdraft fees, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=356.0s)]
*  did he? No, I don't think so. No, they made [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=358.0s)]
*  it clear what Doge was [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=360.0s)]
*  when he was running for president. He did not go to the American people and says [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=362.0s)]
*  I want to raise the amount you pay on late fees. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=364.0s)]
*  Actually, the opposite of that. He said [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=366.0s)]
*  I'm going to cap late fees. That's not what's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=368.0s)]
*  happening when you get rid of the Consumer Protection Bureau. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=370.0s)]
*  You're right, it is too late. So hopefully American people wake up to see what's happening. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=372.0s)]
*  You know what this is like? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=374.0s)]
*  This is like saying that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=376.0s)]
*  a prosecutor, if that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=378.0s)]
*  prosecutor sees fraud and abuse [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=380.0s)]
*  shouldn't be... This is not fraud and abuse, Judge Jeanine. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=382.0s)]
*  Can I finish? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=384.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=386.0s)]
*  If you see fraud and abuse, you should [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=388.0s)]
*  just ignore it. Here's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=390.0s)]
*  the bottom line. There is so much [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=392.0s)]
*  fraud, abuse, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=394.0s)]
*  overspending and corruption in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=396.0s)]
*  our government and the Democrats [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=398.0s)]
*  never wanted us to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=400.0s)]
*  know about it, never gave us the ability [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=402.0s)]
*  to look at it. And so now [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=404.0s)]
*  we have a man who had four years out [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=406.0s)]
*  of office to say, you know what, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=408.0s)]
*  there's a lot more going on than we know. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=410.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden, now, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=412.0s)]
*  and this isn't rocket science, you [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=414.0s)]
*  go in, it's like bringing in a forensic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=416.0s)]
*  account and saying, can you look at these [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=418.0s)]
*  books? No one is losing anything. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=420.0s)]
*  There's a temporary hold. We're going to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=422.0s)]
*  decide what we're going to do with this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=424.0s)]
*  And in three weeks, they've unearthed [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=426.0s)]
*  incredible things that the American [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=428.0s)]
*  people are disgusted with. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=430.0s)]
*  We're paying for transgender operas [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=432.0s)]
*  in foreign countries having nothing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=434.0s)]
*  to do with promoting American interests. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=436.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden, they want to say, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=438.0s)]
*  well, you know, this is all for Elon's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=440.0s)]
*  billionaire buddies. Got nothing to do [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=442.0s)]
*  with that. It's about saving my hard [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=444.0s)]
*  earned taxpayer dollars. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=446.0s)]
*  And in the end, they want to turn it into [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=448.0s)]
*  something that it's not. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=450.0s)]
*  But this has gone on for years. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=452.0s)]
*  And finally, we're taking a look at the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=454.0s)]
*  books. And now we've got a judge to say, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=456.0s)]
*  you can't look anymore. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=458.0s)]
*  I want to stop you from looking at the books. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=460.0s)]
*  How un-American [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=462.0s)]
*  is that? That we can't even [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=464.0s)]
*  decide where there's fraud and abuse. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=466.0s)]
*  And people, 83% of the people [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=468.0s)]
*  in this country, want to change [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=470.0s)]
*  in this government. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=472.0s)]
*  And as Elon Musk said, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=474.0s)]
*  it's about competence and caring. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=476.0s)]
*  And you know what? I care [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=478.0s)]
*  about the fraud in this government. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=480.0s)]
*  And they're unearthing it. They've only been [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=482.0s)]
*  through DOJ, through [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=484.0s)]
*  USAID. Wait. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=486.0s)]
*  We get to education and everything else. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=488.0s)]
*  So who's winning the DOJ debate, Dana [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=490.0s)]
*  Perino, in Washington? Well, I think that when [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=492.0s)]
*  these members of Congress, we've seen this for the past [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=494.0s)]
*  three weeks, when they get up there at their [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=496.0s)]
*  rallies, they think that cursing [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=498.0s)]
*  is persuasion. And they look [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=500.0s)]
*  ridiculous. And they're trying to match, like sometimes [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=502.0s)]
*  President Trump curse, right? And then they would be like, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=504.0s)]
*  oh, my stars. I can't believe you did [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=506.0s)]
*  that. But now they're trying to match that. Instead of trying [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=508.0s)]
*  to say, okay, well, they have a better idea. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=510.0s)]
*  There's no better idea. They're [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=512.0s)]
*  not trying to explain that to people. So I think they're [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=514.0s)]
*  losing there. The other thing is, for example, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=516.0s)]
*  last night on CNN, they had a segment [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=518.0s)]
*  that read, we are three weeks into [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=520.0s)]
*  Trump's second term, and there are [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=522.0s)]
*  warnings that the U.S. is dangerously [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=524.0s)]
*  close to a constitutional crisis. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=526.0s)]
*  But they've been saying this so long that it's become [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=528.0s)]
*  the boy who cried wolf. I just want to mention one [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=530.0s)]
*  other thing. I think there's a new nemesis here that people need to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=532.0s)]
*  think about, and that is [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=534.0s)]
*  government labor unions. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=536.0s)]
*  These are labor unions that are [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=538.0s)]
*  formed for government [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=540.0s)]
*  employees. And then they work [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=542.0s)]
*  against the American taxpayer [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=544.0s)]
*  who's paying their salary. So a lot [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=546.0s)]
*  of these lawsuits and things where they're going to try [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=548.0s)]
*  to gum up the works and slow things down [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=550.0s)]
*  go back to government labor unions, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=552.0s)]
*  and people ought to pay attention to that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=554.0s)]
*  And they also dominate, I mean, they [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=556.0s)]
*  donate strictly to Democrats. 100%. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=558.0s)]
*  And Richard has a lot of late fees on his credit card. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=560.0s)]
*  I think we found that out. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=562.0s)]
*  So just pay your monthly balance, Richard. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=564.0s)]
*  It's going to be fine. We don't need the government to tell you [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=566.0s)]
*  what to do. But one, not all government labor unions [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=568.0s)]
*  support, not all government labor [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=570.0s)]
*  unions support, just Democrats. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=572.0s)]
*  The Border Patrol labor union also [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=574.0s)]
*  endorsed them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=576.0s)]
*  And why do they do that? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=578.0s)]
*  I'm just pointing out the facts. All right, Richard, we're about to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=580.0s)]
*  doze you. Up next, President Trump [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=582.0s)]
*  threatening to unleash hell on Hamas [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=584.0s)]
*  while pushing Arab nations [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=586.0s)]
*  to embrace the Trump-Gaza plan. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkvG8iSz34&t=588.0s)]
