# ‘THEY SUCK RIGHT NOW’: Stephen A. Smith roasts Democratic Party
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4)
*  Why are the Democrats such a disaster? A broken party of off-key clowns singing anti-doge protest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=0.0s)]
*  songs and leaders like Chuck Schumer who use props like beer and avocados. Outspoken ESPN star [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=6.72s)]
*  Stephen A. Smith is giving his party some tough advice, saying they should be quote embarrassed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=13.76s)]
*  that he's even being considered for the 2028 nomination. If you're the Democrats, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=19.84s)]
*  that's why Stephen A. Smith is in the news. Because y'all don't have anybody. You don't have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=26.24s)]
*  anybody. Who you got? Who you got? Kamala Harris better not run. She better not run. I'm not in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=33.44s)]
*  news because I'm here. I'm in the news because the Democratic Party is here. Dammit, lower than that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=40.56s)]
*  Down at the bottom. They suck right now. Horrible. Because they don't have a voice. Where the hell is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  the voice? It's clear that the party needs new leadership, but gone are the days of Barack Obama. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=55.28s)]
*  And the best they can muster for DNC chair is this boring white guy named Ken. Take a look. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=63.36s)]
*  We need to get the DNC out of DC, out of the beltway, reconnecting our message back with [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=70.4s)]
*  voters. That's job number one, right? So many parts of our coalition left us this last election [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=76.0s)]
*  cycle, right? We know that from Latino voters to working class households to young voters to women. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=81.76s)]
*  You can go down the list. The only two groups that we overperformed with in the last election cycle [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=86.64s)]
*  were wealthy households and college educated voters. That's a damning indictment on the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  Democratic Party. We got to do a better job. Okay, Jesse, isn't it refreshing? Let's talk about [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Stephen A. for a minute. Isn't it refreshing that a man that they're pushing for president, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  the Democrats, is saying, you are so stupid. You have such a weak bench. You're actually asking me [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=108.72s)]
*  to do it. Yeah, and Carville just called him an idiot. Carville just said basically shut up and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=114.08s)]
*  dribble. And if you're a Democrat, now is the time to run. It's an open primary. You don't have to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=120.4s)]
*  run against Trump anymore. You're dealing with Harris, who's the front runner. See what I mean? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=127.84s)]
*  So if you're a celebrity, if you're wealthy, if you're Harold Ford Jr., this is when you go for it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=133.44s)]
*  And I mean go for it. I still think Newsom has the inside track to get the nomination, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  but he'll still lose. I'm more interested on the Republican side. JD Vance did a great job the other [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=144.32s)]
*  day in Europe, and he's probably got the advantage. I think Megyn Kelly could be president. She is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=149.84s)]
*  very smart. She's a great debater. She's got a good family. She's telegenic, and she's a woman. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=156.88s)]
*  And why not now? Why not have the first female president a Republican? I think she'd do a great [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=164.32s)]
*  job. Also, Hegseth. I think Hegseth, if he does a nice job at the Pentagon over the next four years, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=170.72s)]
*  Hegseth could make a run. And I think he'd do an excellent job as commander-in-chief. There's a lot [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  of people out there. I don't think the Democrats are going to nominate a woman. They tried it twice, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=183.44s)]
*  hasn't worked. They're probably just going to pump the brakes on that, but they just need an athlete. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=188.4s)]
*  Because right now you got guys going to these games, and they look like, get me out of here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=194.16s)]
*  They just need an athlete who sounds like a normal person. I think we should just let him [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=199.68s)]
*  keep talking. Yeah, I could listen to this for an hour. I'm like, you're kidding. Anyway, do Democrats [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  today even know how much trouble they're in, given this new guy, the DNC chair, Ken, is talking [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=209.28s)]
*  about Democrats are on the side of workers, and they just got to get the message out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=215.04s)]
*  I know. That was so boring. It was like nothing memorable. Stephen A. Smith is memorable. But [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=219.12s)]
*  here's the other thing. This has got to hurt. Quinnipiac today has congressional Democrat approval [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=225.44s)]
*  at 21%. Wow. And that's 20 points lower than congressional Republicans. I'm not saying anyone's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=230.4s)]
*  in terrific shape, but the congressional Democrats have never, I don't think, at least in my [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=237.6s)]
*  experience, have not been that low. And then you don't see people out there that are hitting the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=242.72s)]
*  right tone or message to be an insurgent. And if Stephen A. Smith or somebody like that has the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  energy and pushes forward, and then does something surprising, they have to do something that is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  unique and different. And to me, if one of them is willing to take on the teachers unions and say, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=260.32s)]
*  this is not good enough, our children deserve better, they might have a chance. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=265.68s)]
*  So, Harold, how long do the Democrats have to get behind one person? I would think the sooner, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  the better, because you remember Kamala was like, I only had 90 days when she really had four years, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=274.48s)]
*  but that's not the issue. So that raises in the past. We're now less than six weeks into [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=279.76s)]
*  President Trump's first term and last term as president because he obviously served the first [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=284.48s)]
*  term. Democrats have a ways to go. But Stephen Smith, Stephen A. Smith is on to something. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=288.8s)]
*  His criticism is something the Democrats should take into context. What he's saying is, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=293.68s)]
*  you guys are so discombobulated, so unorganized, so disjointed, so without a message that people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=298.24s)]
*  are looking to me. It was a serious guy, but he's saying, I'm not the person that should be president. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=303.92s)]
*  That same poll that Dana pointed out, it's amazing that the numbers that Democrats have in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=309.44s)]
*  Congress, only 20 percent, Republicans only 40 percent approval. And in fact, President Trump's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  at 45, so everybody's kind of upside down. The country's waiting for a set of answers. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=318.88s)]
*  And Democrats, I think the conversation we had in the first segment was telling and revealing, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=324.24s)]
*  I respect Jesse's position on what you would do with the Doe savings and the kinds of things [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=329.36s)]
*  government is doing. We need to have a serious conversation in the country about what the next [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=333.84s)]
*  five to 10 years, 20 years look like for our families, for our communities, for our national [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  defense and how we fund these things, how we cut taxes, how we raise taxes, how we pay down our [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=342.56s)]
*  debt. Democrats, the opportunities are there, but if you keep yelling and screaming and being angry [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=347.76s)]
*  and just opposing things, people aren't going to listen to you. Whatever you want to say about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=354.24s)]
*  Doge, people want reforms. If you have better reforms, offer those ideas instead of singing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=358.08s)]
*  and yelling. I was not as down on this Ken Martin guy. He may not be the most exciting fella, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=364.64s)]
*  but he's right. He's not my leader, but he's a DNC chair. He should take the DNC out of D.C., [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  but take the DNC out of D.C. to get a message, to listen to voters and to bring back a platform [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=374.96s)]
*  of ideas that resonate and connect with our future. Greg, should I get out of D.C.? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=380.96s)]
*  I don't know. I look at Ken Martin. That guy is so white he makes Jesse look like Jay-Z. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=387.52s)]
*  He looks like every dad in a commercial where the wife shows him how he can save money on [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=393.12s)]
*  car insurance because he's too stupid to do it on his own. Harold's too good looking and too [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  smart for politics. That's reverse psychology. The thing is, I listen to all these vocal liberals [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=402.8s)]
*  now and it's like, where were you for four years when you had an incapacitated president? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=410.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't watch Smith. He seems like a nice guy. I don't remember seeing him talk about [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=414.48s)]
*  the fact that we had a brain dead president or that we had a complete conspiracy to hide that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=420.8s)]
*  I disagree that the Democrats suck right now. They suck before. They suck now. I have a feeling [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=427.68s)]
*  they're going to suck after because they've made it clear that within their group of people, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=433.76000000000005s)]
*  some people are better than others. The irony of the Democrats is that there's no equality [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=439.68s)]
*  in equity. Some people are worth less based on their immutable characteristics. If you're a white [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=445.92s)]
*  straight guy, you're not as important as a female woman of color who is gay. I took three boxes [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=452.0s)]
*  there, right? Yeah, got it. I think the problem is that you can't unify a group of people if they [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=464.56s)]
*  all feel like they're part of a hierarchy in which one matters more than the other. You saw that in [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=471.68s)]
*  that DNC meeting when they were trying to choose a guy and they ended up with a white guy. Is he [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=476.32s)]
*  straight? I don't know. Let's get on that research. I need to find out. They were arguing over the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=479.92s)]
*  gender of people. It was embarrassing. This is why they can't find their own Joe Rogan. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=487.12s)]
*  It's because no one can sit in that chair. After five minutes, you're going to be yelling at him [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=492.48s)]
*  about some tripwire he crossed. He goes, my pronoun is they. It's like, screw you, they. All they of you. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=498.64s)]
*  I'm going to find out if Ken is gay. He's married. But is he married to a female? Yes. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=506.8s)]
*  Oh, a woman? Yes. Eww. Let it go. The judge said it well yesterday. You talked about Joe Rogan being [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=512.72s)]
*  a Democrat before. You can't just find a Joe Rogan. That was a natural evolution you made. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=521.52s)]
*  You know, Harold, that was a smart move on his part. Yes, ma'am. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmv1PD8lf4&t=528.48s)]
