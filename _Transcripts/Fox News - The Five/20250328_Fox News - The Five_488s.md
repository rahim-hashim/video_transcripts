# IN DEI-NIAL: Walz SCORCHED for role as ‘false prophet of identity politics’
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs)
*  Tiana Minton is showing why Democrats are failing to rebuild their party after getting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=0.0s)]
*  smoked by Trump in November. The failed VP candidate is now doubling down on DEI. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=5.28s)]
*  Our strength is our diversity. We've been talking about this for years as a country of immigrants, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=13.36s)]
*  and we let them define the issue on immigration. We let them define the issue on DNI, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=19.2s)]
*  and we let them define what woke is. We got ourselves in this mess because we weren't [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=25.44s)]
*  bold enough to stand up and say you're right. We're proud of these policies. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=32.24s)]
*  We're going to put them in and we're going to execute them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=35.84s)]
*  The former coach didn't stop there, springing in some identity politics as well. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=39.44s)]
*  All the young people here, I just pause for a moment and look around and look at, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=46.32s)]
*  I'm especially talking about these old white guys who seem to disappoint us on a regular [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=53.28s)]
*  basis in this country, but not this group, not this group that's here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=57.68s)]
*  All right, Jessica, in exactly what way could doubling down on DEI and woke and redefining it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=64.24s)]
*  contribute or energize those marginalized parties who didn't vote Democrat? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=72.4s)]
*  In no way whatsoever. I don't think there's any Democrat that's been thinking about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=77.6s)]
*  how we win in 26 or 28 that agrees with what Walls is saying, and it just makes for clips that can [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  be aired in our face, which I don't really enjoy as someone who will probably have to watch the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  most of those clips as we head into election season. The truth is that Democrats are winning [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=96.08s)]
*  elections with moderate candidates. The Blue Dogs are overperforming, five points over. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=103.04s)]
*  Far-left progressives are underperforming. And this isn't helping at a moment where actually [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  we're building some momentum. Elise Stefanik would be UN ambassador if the Republicans felt [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=115.04s)]
*  good about what's going on, but she has to go back to her district. They're looking at internal [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=121.04s)]
*  polling from the Florida special election in the sixth district where Mike Walz was. It was a Trump [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  plus 30. The internal polling shows that the Democrat there, Josh Wild, is up three, and we [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=131.6s)]
*  just flipped a state Senate seat in Pennsylvania that was a Trump plus 15. So those are all places [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=136.4s)]
*  where we can win if you have a moderate message, and immigration, I think, is the number one place [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=142.24s)]
*  that you have to make sure that you do. You know, Jesse, Trump's approval is the highest it's ever [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  been, and Republicans are now overwhelmingly supporting him. I think it's 91 percent of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  base, and he's up nine points with black adults since the first term, 15 Hispanic adults, six [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=160.56s)]
*  young adults. He's more popular than ever, even more popular now than he was in November. He's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=166.72s)]
*  even more popular with Jessica. Jessica used to hate him, and now she respects him. And you can [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=172.24s)]
*  see the way he's respected more when he answers questions from the press. Remember the first term, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  they just accused him of being a traitor and a racist all day, and now they're like, Mr. President, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=183.12s)]
*  what is your policy vis-a-vis Ukraine? Like, they're legitimate respecting him now. Now, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=188.16s)]
*  Tampon is acting like the country would have loved being invaded if Democrats had just described the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=193.28s)]
*  invasion differently. Like, oh, if they had said they're just neighbors coming over to mow our [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=199.92s)]
*  lawns and bring tacos, the country would have been like, you know what, let them all in. It's like, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=206.16s)]
*  DEI was a great product. We just didn't have the right commercial. Like, Democrats should have [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=212.48s)]
*  brought in Don Draper and be like, DEI, American as apple pie, cut to Tom Brady throwing touchdowns to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=218.64s)]
*  homeless veterans and transgender, cut to an interracial couple kissing on the beach. That's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=227.6s)]
*  what they think they could have done to sell this. It's all sales. I don't like the fact that he's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  putting down old white guys. Yes, we can't dance. Yes, we get nervous at airports. Yes, some of our [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=239.2s)]
*  decisions have been a little bit bad, but we have done a lot for this country. He's kind of like [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  Doug Emhoff, you know, I'm going to push my wife here. This guy, Tampon, lets his wife order for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=249.28s)]
*  him at dinner. He's that guy. And you know what he orders? Soup. He drinks it through a straw. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  All right. All right, Sandra. I mean, what about the fact that even CNN now is saying [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=264.8s)]
*  he's more popular than he was at any point in time and the largest share of Americans in decades [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  believe the country's on the right track? So I mean, it's just beyond him. Not many people are [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  watching that network right now, but I can tell you from clips that I've watched that there is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=283.04s)]
*  shock in the reporter and the anchors faces when they have to report that news because it is indeed [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=287.36s)]
*  in the case. I just want to stand up for the state of Louisiana and the men down there. They [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=292.0s)]
*  can dance. They can cook. They can do all those things. And gosh darn, they eat soup. It's called [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=295.92s)]
*  gumbo. All right. So I was just noticing the contrast with Tim Walz on that stage making [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=301.92s)]
*  these points. The contrast to what we were just seeing with these strong, smart men sitting with [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=308.48s)]
*  Elon Musk last night in that interview and what they are doing for this country and putting country [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=315.12s)]
*  first. And as the Daily Beast put it, Tim Walz has a bad case of main character syndrome. I mean, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=319.52s)]
*  he makes it all about himself. I think the last time I was on this show, we were watching him in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=325.12s)]
*  this video show how manly he was walking around in a field with a shotgun, carrying it like a baby [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=330.0s)]
*  inappropriately. So I wrote this down as you were talking though, judging as you were leaning in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump's more popular right now than any moment in this presidency and his previous presidency. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  You look at pulling on the direction of the country that is on the rise. People are feeling [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=347.84s)]
*  more optimistic about the future in this country. And you've got Tim Walz who thinks it's a good idea [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=351.76s)]
*  to double down on what didn't work. Yeah. Think about that. Yeah. You think about it, Greg. I'm [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  trying to think first. I must correct something I said in the A block. Oh, yes. I said, Jessie was [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=362.64s)]
*  smart. I misspoke. I said 1.5% of federal workers were released when it was 0.15. And that is a big [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=368.0s)]
*  deal. That's a difference of like 10. Don't ask me. Tenfold. I'm not smart. You know, here's my [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=377.2s)]
*  question. Is Tim Walz gaining any traction since the election? Who is he? And more to the question, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=381.76s)]
*  who was he talking to there? Like, do you ever wonder what his audience was? Is it like these [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=391.2s)]
*  remaining wokesters in the dying legacy media? Has anybody told him Joy Reid is gone? He's like [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=396.08s)]
*  a high school guidance counselor trying to be cool with the non-binaries during recess, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=402.08s)]
*  but he's still preaching the false prophet. He's like the false prophet of identity politics, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=407.68s)]
*  telling everybody that they're just some of their intersectional parts. When in fact, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=413.28s)]
*  if he just acted like a human being, he'd be way better off. But then he contradicts himself. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=420.08s)]
*  He's all for identity politics. And then he comes out and he goes, the worst thing are old white men, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=424.64s)]
*  but not me. You know, he's basically saying it's not, I'm different. Those, but wait a minute, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=431.36s)]
*  you should be in the box. If you created this box, you can't just step out of the box and say, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=437.2s)]
*  oh, I'm not like them. If you say we're all old white men are bad, you're bad too. You should [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=442.56s)]
*  resign. You should resign from your office. Make some room for a black lesbian. You know, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  it's about time for a black lesbian governor of whatever state, Minnesota. I still don't know [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  what he is. We were told he was a new breed of masculine male, so confident in his manhood. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=461.44s)]
*  He could put tampons in a boy's room. Beto O'Rourke's in the audience if you see him there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=466.64s)]
*  You know, I thought that looked like him. Both men do weird stuff like this with their hands. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=472.0s)]
*  What is Beto up to? What is Beto up to? We don't care. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=475.52s)]
*  I'm Beto O'Rourke. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNyw_bTkWs&t=484.64s)]
