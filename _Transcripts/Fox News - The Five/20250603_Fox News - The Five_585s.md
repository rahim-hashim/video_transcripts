# 'The Five' on Biden's 'gotaways' sparking fears of terror attacks
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0)
*  Orders are Tom Homan with an urgent and chilling warning for America after an illegal immigrant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Biden let in launched a horrific hate crime attack against Jewish people in Colorado. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=5.48s)]
*  The Biden administration were bringing people unvetted, handing out work fees like they're [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=12.16s)]
*  candy while they sat here and planned something bad. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=17.12s)]
*  We are going to be dealing with this for the next 10 years because of the chaos they created [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=21.28s)]
*  in four years. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=26.16s)]
*  Two million people paid more to get away. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=27.16s)]
*  They didn't want to be vetted. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=29.24s)]
*  They didn't want to be fingerprinted. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=30.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  This scares the hell out of me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  I've been doing this for 40 years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=34.72s)]
*  It should have scared the hell out of every American what the Biden administration did. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=36.6s)]
*  This two million known God aways scares the hell out of me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=40.4s)]
*  So I'm convinced something's coming unless we can find them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  And now Fox News can confirm the wife and all five kids of the suspected terrorist are [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=47.959999999999994s)]
*  in ICE custody and the White House says the family could be deported as soon as tonight. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  They said, quote, six one way tickets for Mohammed's wife and five kids. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=58.14s)]
*  Final boarding call coming soon. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=62.7s)]
*  Jesse, you know, the two million known God aways, these are people who came over the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=64.9s)]
*  border and went out of their way not to be detected. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=69.7s)]
*  We don't know who they are. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=72.52s)]
*  We don't know why they're here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=73.62s)]
*  We don't know what their goals are being here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=74.62s)]
*  Tom Homan says it scares the hell out of him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=76.58s)]
*  And it should. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=78.98s)]
*  If you were taking a time machine from now to go right after 9 11 and you would say that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=79.98s)]
*  the Democratic Party let in millions and millions of people from the Middle East, from Africa, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=85.46s)]
*  China, Venezuela, you would think the party was committing suicide or you would think [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=91.86s)]
*  there was a hostile takeover of the United States because the same people who were there [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=97.33999999999999s)]
*  on 9 11 are still in power in Washington. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=102.86s)]
*  They go to 9 11 ceremonies and then they tweet hashtag never forget. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=105.61999999999999s)]
*  And then they're OK with letting in half the world unchecked just because they want the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=110.82s)]
*  cheap labor, just because they want the new voters. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=115.26s)]
*  You know, they say, you know, it's different because this guy didn't come across the border. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  They're still flying them in. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=121.9s)]
*  And then there's chain migration. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  So this guy's here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=125.22s)]
*  He's got his wife and he's got his five kids and the kids are using our schools. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=126.22s)]
*  They're using our hospitals. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=131.9s)]
*  They're jacking up rent. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=133.58s)]
*  They're jacking up insurance. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=134.66s)]
*  This is becoming almost as bad as defund the police. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=137.9s)]
*  Remember how much damage that did to the Democratic Party and what they're doing to the ICE agents [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  attacking ICE. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=145.58s)]
*  I think it's going to be the exact same thing what happened to the Democrats with the fund [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=146.58s)]
*  the police here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=150.5s)]
*  Yeah, Dana, I think the question that a lot of us still have is why did this happen? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=151.5s)]
*  You know, you hear Tom Homan say they're they're literally handing out work visas like candy [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=157.02s)]
*  in the Biden administration to these people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=160.62s)]
*  We know that there was just no check at all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=163.54s)]
*  They were they are actually facilitating the entry. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=166.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=168.7s)]
*  Well, as Abe Greenwald says, I hate to keep repeating his phrase, but it's much worse [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=169.7s)]
*  than that because the work visas, it's one thing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=174.9s)]
*  Right. But when we would do stories on Fox about the known gotaways, for example, at [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=177.74s)]
*  the White House briefing room, the press secretary would say the border is secure. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  The Homeland Security secretary would say the border is secure. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=186.26000000000002s)]
*  Like you could literally have Majorca's or Karin Jean-Pierre on TV saying the border [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=188.66000000000003s)]
*  is secure into a split screen and have our cameras at the border, the only media that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=193.66000000000003s)]
*  was there for the most part, showing them actually they're just streaming across. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=198.18s)]
*  Our ICE agents were overwhelmed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=202.06s)]
*  They got into the country of so many gotaways. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=203.5s)]
*  And thank goodness you have people like Tom Homan who can't sleep, won't sleep for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=206.54s)]
*  probably 10 years because of what we are dealing with. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=210.22s)]
*  I also believe that one of the biggest reasons Biden's lost one is this issue. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=214.18s)]
*  But it's also why they are continuing to have this problem, because who's going to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=218.06s)]
*  step up and say Majorca's was wrong? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=221.3s)]
*  Karin Jean-Pierre was wrong. Biden was wrong. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=223.74s)]
*  We should never have let that happen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=225.3s)]
*  And now I do think that every president since 9-11 has lost sleep over this issue. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=226.94s)]
*  This is the thing that worries them the most. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=234.66s)]
*  Like, are we in the right spot? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=236.66s)]
*  Are we finding them? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=238.5s)]
*  And because you have the anti-Semitism that is growing on top of all of this and the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  global intifada is now here inside the borders, it makes it much more difficult. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=244.34s)]
*  So we have to give law enforcement and intelligence, the intelligence community [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=249.06s)]
*  everything that they need to try to protect people who are vulnerable. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=252.66000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, Greg, this guy, I think as Jesse pointed out, maybe he didn't come [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  across the border, but he overstayed a work visa. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=261.94s)]
*  He was here illegally. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=263.82s)]
*  This is just another example, I think, of someone who should never have been here to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=265.66s)]
*  commit this crime. Yet here he was. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  Kind of goes back to what we were talking about in the A-block about the idea that, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=273.02s)]
*  you know, this is different than the usual disgust with a party. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=277.46000000000004s)]
*  Remember, Mayorkas also lied to the American people about Biden's mental state. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=281.58s)]
*  I believe he said that he couldn't keep up with them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  Right. So, I mean, even Harold's laughing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=288.9s)]
*  But when you think about it, the border accurately reflected Joe's mental state, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  you know, chaos, decline and neglect. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=298.7s)]
*  And as a result, a lot of people died. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=301.38s)]
*  They died at the hands of criminals. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=303.46s)]
*  And you have attacks like this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  And the media is complicit because, you know, we, I mean, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=307.29999999999995s)]
*  we were doing the border every day so much so we were sick of it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=311.85999999999996s)]
*  And and and and oh, and every other network did not cover it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=317.34s)]
*  They mocked us. You know, with the I'm sure Chris Van Ahlen, is that his name? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  He's going to probably hop on a plane to meet with this guy's, you know, wife and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=324.9s)]
*  kids. Just don't just don't order the cocktails. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=328.34s)]
*  But I love with Homan, there is no screwing around. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=331.85999999999996s)]
*  There's no phony virtue signaling. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=337.02s)]
*  There's no self-important activism. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=339.41999999999996s)]
*  There's no false empathy or false compassion. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=341.9s)]
*  You may have as a Democrat, you may worry about his methods, but you won't worry [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=345.02s)]
*  about him not doing his job. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  He's moving fast because he has to play catch up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=351.62s)]
*  This is like Trump took over a property that's been in disrepair, overrun by [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=354.7s)]
*  squatters. It's not going to be safe overnight. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=359.34s)]
*  Harold, you know, they you look at this guy, the boulder suspect here, and they [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=362.82s)]
*  say he was a lone wolf, meaning, you know, he wasn't part of a bigger network or [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=366.9s)]
*  anything like that. But you see this on the heels of this D.C. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  shooting of the Jewish couple. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  You see this, you know, in conjunction with all this anti-Semitism boiling over on [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=377.85999999999996s)]
*  college campuses. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=382.7s)]
*  I think a lot of people are feeling very upset and very nervous right now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=384.38s)]
*  And I think rightly so. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=388.17999999999995s)]
*  No, I would agree. We've covered this rightly so. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=389.94s)]
*  And I hope this is a story we continue to cover because it has two, I think, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=393.26000000000005s)]
*  important aspects. One is that you touched on it well, Laura, the anti-Semitism. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=397.14000000000004s)]
*  And two is the this this this deportations we're trying to do. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  I tried to say yesterday, I think Tom Holman means well. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  And I think, again, I've said before, I think he looks oftentimes like he's trying [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=410.22s)]
*  out for Clint Eastwood movie. And that's fine. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  But we ought to be instead of blaming Biden and blaming Obama and blaming Clinton, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  you're in charge now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=421.62s)]
*  I hope that you look at two things to try to get this get the crime thing right, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=422.74s)]
*  because anti-Semitism, the deportations are all revolving around awful crimes [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=426.98s)]
*  that are being committed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=431.22s)]
*  Use and collaborate with local law enforcement. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=432.42s)]
*  They're the ones that have all the information about a lot of these people and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=434.9s)]
*  to use AI to help sort through this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=437.34s)]
*  I want every guy in this country, a woman in this country, a kid in this country [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=439.38s)]
*  who's related to somebody like this guy who's been planning this for a year to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=442.62s)]
*  kill Jewish people, who's waiting for his kids to get out of the house so he could [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=446.78s)]
*  do it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=449.9s)]
*  I want us to find using AI and using every possible lead we can where these [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  people are and let them be a part of that first group you want to kick out as [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=455.65999999999997s)]
*  well. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=458.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm one Democrat who will say send them wherever you want to send them. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=458.74s)]
*  But let's let's stop blaming everybody and the tone and disposition. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=462.78s)]
*  Sometimes I think he and Stephen Miller, who I think is probably a well-meaning [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=466.86s)]
*  guy, work with people, work with local law enforcement and use every tool at your [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=470.26s)]
*  disposal to try to prevent and limit, but not try to prevent these type of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=475.18s)]
*  awful, tragic things from happening around our country, particularly with [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=480.3s)]
*  people who are here illegally. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=484.46s)]
*  But Harold, the tone is part of the package. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  It might be, but that's not my tone. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=488.62s)]
*  It's like, I don't mind, like, I agree, Homan can come off rough, but man, that's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=490.26s)]
*  who he is and that I want that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=493.90000000000003s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=495.42s)]
*  But then do the job. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  He is. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=497.14s)]
*  Have you seen the number of illegals? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  The lowest number in the history of America. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=500.7s)]
*  But then don't blame Biden. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=502.42s)]
*  We have to blame Biden. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=504.5s)]
*  Because there needs to be retribution. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  There needs to be justice. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=508.14s)]
*  And I'm not going to rest until you're behind bars. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  Do you want me to... [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=514.22s)]
*  What if I just blamed whites in the 60s and the 70s and never forgave anybody? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=515.26s)]
*  I mean, I hear what you're saying and I get the hope. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=520.78s)]
*  I've forgiven whites, Harold. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=522.74s)]
*  I have forgiven them. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=523.8199999999999s)]
*  It took me a long time. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=525.02s)]
*  I forgive you every time I'm on this show. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=526.62s)]
*  I understand. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=528.14s)]
*  My only point is use every tool to try to make sure we fight, because there are a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=529.62s)]
*  lot more of these guys out there, I think. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=533.98s)]
*  And I don't want to try to prevent these stories. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=535.5s)]
*  He needs... [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=537.8199999999999s)]
*  They do want to work with local law enforcement. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=538.6999999999999s)]
*  One of the problems is, like, for example, Eric Adams here, he wants to work with ICE, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=540.4599999999999s)]
*  but they're not allowed because of sanctuary cities. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=544.9s)]
*  That's the biggest problem. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=547.4599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=548.66s)]
*  But if you walk in, they will. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  They're not going to let you just set up and go in the restaurants and they differ there. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=550.74s)]
*  I don't mind some of that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=554.22s)]
*  But if you tell them, we know there's a guy named this guy, a woman here and a guy there. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=555.18s)]
*  Here's where they're on this list because we use this. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=558.9s)]
*  We need to be able to find them, help us. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=560.74s)]
*  You have other information? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=562.06s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=563.14s)]
*  I think they think they're tools we should be using. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=563.86s)]
*  They're always ready to go. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=566.4599999999999s)]
*  Look, Clint Eastwood, let's go. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=567.0600000000001s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=568.9s)]
*  Coming up, why are liberals so miserable while conservatives are having the time of their life? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2yt30I4-W0&t=569.46s)]
