# ‘The Five’: Democratic infighting reaches a new level
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ)
*  Did Joe Biden's senior moments ruin it for older Democrats? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  A civil war is erupting in the party, pitting the old guard versus the new guard as a wave [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=4.36s)]
*  of retirements clears a path for younger Democrats. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  A Rutgers political scientist is blaming the former president saying this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=11.92s)]
*  This is fallout from the Biden effect, a contaminated old Democrats. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  According to Harvard's new youth poll, approval of the Democratic Party has plummeted in half [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  in just five years. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=24.8s)]
*  In the first domino to fall, Illinois Senator Dichter has been announcing his retirement [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=26.28s)]
*  after decades in Congress. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  I think if you're honest about yourself and your reputation, you want to leave when you [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=32.92s)]
*  can still walk out the front door and not be carried out the back door. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=38.2s)]
*  This old versus young dynamic is playing out at the DNC with the party's chairman, Ken [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=42.72s)]
*  Martin, forced to rebuke by President Biden. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=48.56s)]
*  Thank you, Greg. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=51.16s)]
*  Anyway, there's some Democrats. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=52.63999999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  Voters should decide who our primary nominees are, not DNC leadership. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  I have great respect for David Hogg. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=62.16s)]
*  I've said to him, if you want to challenge in comments, you're more than free to do that, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  but just not as an officer of the DNC because our job is to be neutral arbiters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=68.19999999999999s)]
*  But the young uprising comes at a cost and National Review is saying this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=74.72s)]
*  Social media is killing the Democratic Party, warning that swing state voters are not fans [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=78.56s)]
*  of the party elevating left-wing influencers over coalition builders. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=82.36s)]
*  But Pete Buttigieg is warning Dems to cool it with the woke finger pointing, saying this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=86.08s)]
*  There are a lot of people that I think Democrats are understood to care about. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=91.56s)]
*  Low income people, black and brown people are disproportionately caught up in the economic [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=95.72s)]
*  pain when something like this happens. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=99.44s)]
*  And so I do think my party needs to do a much better job, especially with the kind of finger [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=101.2s)]
*  wagging that you're talking about. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=104.84s)]
*  I think we are like very prone to that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=106.08s)]
*  You get this sense of like moral conviction and you're so sure of it that you start to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  think it makes it OK to be an a**hole. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=113.4s)]
*  Oh, there's a cursing again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=117.36s)]
*  We love the cursing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=118.8s)]
*  Jessica, they are old, but their ideas seem even older. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=119.8s)]
*  Curious what you think about this decision. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  I know Dick Durbin has been there for a long time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=126.56s)]
*  It's interesting that he's calling himself a moderate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=129.2s)]
*  I'm not sure that would fit the bill. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=132.6s)]
*  Although compared to the young guard, maybe he is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=134.84s)]
*  Is that a problem? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=137.72s)]
*  I'm not sure it's a problem. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=138.72s)]
*  Dick Durbin is not running. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  OK, just kidding. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  OK, so early in the show, you know, Dick Durbin is 80 years old and I'm not sure that this [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  would have been any different. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=151.2s)]
*  This decision had the Biden issue happened or not. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=152.88s)]
*  Or Gene Shaheen in New Hampshire clearing the way for I think Chris Pappas should have [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  very good shot at winning that seat. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=160.12s)]
*  There's a lot of young talent and there are people who I think were considering their [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=162.6s)]
*  retirement before Joe Biden stayed on too long. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=166.38s)]
*  In terms of being moderate, the most important thing that Dick Durbin did for the party was [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  he was always spearheading the bipartisan immigration legislation and really wanting [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=174.64s)]
*  to get a comprehensive immigration plan passed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  And I don't know who's going to take over that mantle piece for us. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=183.0s)]
*  But, you know, I don't think all hope is lost in this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  I think it's great if Lauren Underwood, who I like a lot, is the one that takes over for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=190.52s)]
*  that Illinois Senate seat. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=194.12s)]
*  I think it's a very good thing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=195.12s)]
*  I know Lieutenant Governor is running as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=196.12s)]
*  As for Ken Martin, it's good to see him kind of putting a smack down on what's going on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=199.4s)]
*  with David Hogg. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=203.36s)]
*  And he says, you're more than welcome to spend money on races. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=204.36s)]
*  You just can't be part of the DNC and do that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=206.28s)]
*  And a lot of people wanted that vice chair job that David Hogg got. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=209.32s)]
*  And it'll be interesting to see what he chooses to do to be part of the party infrastructure [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=213.72s)]
*  to go out on his own. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=217.82s)]
*  So time waits for no one, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=219.28s)]
*  It's the most bipartisan thing in the world, Kayleigh. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=220.72s)]
*  And you have the you did have the Biden effect. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=223.56s)]
*  But when you look at the average age of the leadership of the Democratic Party, it is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=226.56s)]
*  way up there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=230.36s)]
*  And so this is a little bit inevitable. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=231.72s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=233.72s)]
*  And you're going to see these challengers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=234.72s)]
*  They tend to be younger. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=235.72s)]
*  They tend to be progressive. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=236.72s)]
*  They tend to be popular among Democrats, like we've seen in the polling with AOC. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=238.44s)]
*  The end of what Jessica said there, I want to pick up on that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=242.52s)]
*  Ken Martin at the DNC. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=244.84s)]
*  He's exactly right to say you cannot be a player and a referee. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=246.84s)]
*  I worked at the RNC for nearly three years and we did not play in primaries. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  It was a strict rule. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=255.16s)]
*  We are there to support whoever gets the nomination and carry it forward. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=256.68s)]
*  So David Hogg is wrong in that sense to say, let's go out in primary people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=260.08s)]
*  Here's the problem for the DNC. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=264.76s)]
*  They have a hypocrisy problem. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=266.52s)]
*  A lot of people like David Hogg, perhaps remember Bernie Sanders in 2016 and Donna Brazile, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=268.8s)]
*  who wrote the book, who said if the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=275.72s)]
*  had control of the party. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=279.32000000000005s)]
*  She was meeting the Hillary Clinton campaign. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=280.6s)]
*  She said it was not criminal, but it compromised the party's integrity. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=282.16s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren was asked, do you think this was rigged against Bernie? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=286.16s)]
*  She said, yes. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  We all remember the emails that came out that talked about Bernie Sanders' religion and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  how that would play in Kentucky and West Virginia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=293.6s)]
*  Even the New York Times called into question the integrity of the DNC and their fairness [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=296.24s)]
*  there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  And then we remember 2024, where not a single vote was cast for Kamala Harris. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  I get it was an aberrational circumstance, but I'm certain there are young people, there [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=304.8s)]
*  are Gen Z, there are progressives on the sidelines who feel like the deck has been stacked against [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=309.12s)]
*  them and the DNC is going to have to figure that out. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=314.0s)]
*  Ken Martin's right, but you got to grapple with the past. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=316.64s)]
*  What about, Greg, the fact that the cover up of Biden's age and acuity is affecting [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=319.24s)]
*  them? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think they hurt people, hurt the Democratic Party for an entire generation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, unless the media doesn't write about it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=330.24s)]
*  The way it's portrayed, they're all acting like this, was a big surprise. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=333.32s)]
*  I think there are obvious explanations for this that have nothing to do with age. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  No one wants to be in a party where they aren't wanted. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=341.44s)]
*  Men left because they were tired of being the villain in every story. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=344.12s)]
*  Where did they go? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=347.04s)]
*  The party where it's okay to be a guy and the women do not have penises. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=348.04s)]
*  So no brainer, that's where you go. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=352.8s)]
*  Sad to see Dick go, though. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=354.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=356.44s)]
*  I think this is a blowback due to identity politics. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=358.44s)]
*  The party became the awful party, the affluent white liberal female, where they identify [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=361.92s)]
*  every group. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=367.76s)]
*  They created a hierarchy of grievance where blame and victimhood became its currency. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=368.84s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you're 40 or 80 or 20 or 30. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=378.08s)]
*  If you embrace this Marxist platform, that life is nothing but a struggle between people [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=381.72s)]
*  with power. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=386.96s)]
*  It's going to drive people crazy. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=388.68s)]
*  We notice this in your Peloton class, in your book club, in the movies you watch. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=391.32s)]
*  It's suffocating. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=397.2s)]
*  People don't want to be in a world where somebody is blaming somebody else. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=398.46s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=402.35999999999996s)]
*  The very worst thing possible. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=403.5s)]
*  The Democrats became uncool. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  This is like the first time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=408.64s)]
*  They became the next door neighbor in Bewitched. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  Was it Mrs. Gladys? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=412.56s)]
*  Gladys. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=415.56s)]
*  The dean in Animal House. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=416.96s)]
*  And then you have Fonzie, America's bad boy, a mix of evil Knievel, Don Rickles, and Godzilla, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=418.64s)]
*  all in Donald Trump. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=426.56s)]
*  And the more that you demonized him, the cooler he got. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=427.8s)]
*  He became the political equivalent of a Hell's Angels jacket. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=431.08s)]
*  You put it on, underneath it you got a pack of smokes wrapped up in your t-shirt. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=434.12s)]
*  It just was like, what kid wouldn't like to be part of that, as opposed to the party that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=438.56s)]
*  their substitute teacher belongs to with all her little pins on her backpack. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=444.84s)]
*  It is the Democrats' greatest achievement that they made common sense, the essence of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=449.52s)]
*  rebellion, and they anointed Trump being its gladiator. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  The wackier and more intrusive, the woke-driven Democrats got, the more subversive stuff like [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=459.84s)]
*  plastic straws, gas-powered cars, you know, hot real women became. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=465.67999999999995s)]
*  The Dems became the frumpy crone in the used bookstore. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=470.86s)]
*  The Republicans became the bikini-clad woman holding a flamethrower. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=475.38s)]
*  Who doesn't want that? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=480.1s)]
*  That's fun. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  That's a good visual to turn to Brian on for our last word. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  I was going to say the exact same thing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=486.42s)]
*  But I don't think age matters. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=488.94s)]
*  I don't think Joe Biden didn't ruin older people for being the leaders of the Democratic [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=490.5s)]
*  Party. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=495.94s)]
*  It's just credibility. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=496.94s)]
*  I think that people know that he wasn't ready for the job. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=497.94s)]
*  They got mad at you when you brought it up, and people covered for him. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=500.18s)]
*  And now the media lied for him. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=503.58s)]
*  Now they have no credibility. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=504.98s)]
*  Joe Biden's gone, and they've lost the trust of the American people. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=506.22s)]
*  In terms of David Hogg, I mean, he has never run a campaign. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=510.62s)]
*  He has never helped a candidate. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=514.1s)]
*  He has just yelled a lot about guns, and he's able to raise a lot of money. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=515.88s)]
*  So he's being attacked not by us and not by people outside here. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=520.22s)]
*  He's being attacked by people at his own party. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=524.46s)]
*  They're saying, calling him a twerp. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=526.22s)]
*  They're calling him out. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=528.0600000000001s)]
*  And I remember what Reince Priebus said on Sunday. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=529.14s)]
*  He said, what would you do if your vice chair came out and said, I'm going to primary people? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=531.0999999999999s)]
*  He goes, oh, I would have fired him. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=536.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=537.42s)]
*  He said, I would have fired him. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=538.42s)]
*  He says, you have some good points. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=539.42s)]
*  I kind of agree with you. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=540.42s)]
*  But you can't do this. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  That's not the way it works. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=542.6999999999999s)]
*  Someone in charge has their deputy turn on them. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=544.3399999999999s)]
*  And I would just say this. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=547.3399999999999s)]
*  You just saw the most inauthentic thing possible to start this segment. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=548.68s)]
*  It was Mayor Pete cursing, growing a beard, who took his pronouns down because he looked [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=552.42s)]
*  at the pie charts and the bar graphs and said, you've got to be tough and you've got to show [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=558.3s)]
*  a ruggedness. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=562.5s)]
*  So he's playing dress up again. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=563.62s)]
*  So to me, if that is what you're going to bet on inauthenticity, and what Trump did [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=565.98s)]
*  today, for example, it just punted anybody who's concerned about age. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=570.62s)]
*  You know, Dick Dermott stepped aside. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=574.8199999999999s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=576.54s)]
*  I don't think he's slipping. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=577.54s)]
*  But does anyone remember they said Trump was slipping? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=578.54s)]
*  This guy every day talks to the press for 90 minutes. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=580.8199999999999s)]
*  He just sat there with the prime minister in Norway and just took every question all [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=583.26s)]
*  the time. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=587.1s)]
*  He's the only one who's ever been asked to go sit down with three reporters from the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=588.94s)]
*  Atlantic. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=592.4200000000001s)]
*  If you weren't confident at the top of your game, well, worry. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=593.4200000000001s)]
*  Do you think he had to go talk to his no offense, talk to his press team to find out if I should [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=596.4200000000001s)]
*  do the Atlantic story? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=600.1800000000001s)]
*  No, I can do it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=601.1800000000001s)]
*  He doesn't talk to them. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  I just think that age doesn't matter. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=603.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't think Biden ruined for age. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=606.1800000000001s)]
*  I just think he ruined for credibility because he couldn't do the job and he didn't tell [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=607.66s)]
*  us. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=611.1s)]
*  He wouldn't admit it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=612.1s)]
*  The party covered for him and now the media covered for him. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=613.1s)]
*  Can I mention one thing about David Hogg that Karl Rove told us today on Newsroom? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=616.58s)]
*  He said that so David Hogg has a super pack of his own separate from this and he raised [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=619.94s)]
*  almost 12 million dollars and he out of that 12 million dollars he donated to two democratic [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=624.6s)]
*  campaigns. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=630.1s)]
*  Where did the rest of it go? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=631.1s)]
*  Operations. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=632.34s)]
*  And one of the things Karl looked at was on the FEC report, DoorDash. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=633.34s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=637.7s)]
*  I mean, the numbers are unbelievable. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=638.7s)]
*  Most compelling analysis. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=646.34s)]
*  You won't get it anywhere else. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLHECWYqnEQ&t=648.26s)]
