# FAN MAIL: ‘The Five’ answers viewer questions
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8)
*  It's Memorial Day, the unofficial kickoff to summer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=0.0s)]
*  But before firing up the grill or hitting the beach, we can't forget what today is about. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=3.56s)]
*  Honoring and saluting our military heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=7.96s)]
*  We have a huge show ahead, so let's kick it off with your fan mail questions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=13.0s)]
*  Isn't that exciting? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=17.52s)]
*  Yeah, so good to be here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=19.0s)]
*  All right, first question from Connie C. What was the biggest punishment you received as [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  a kid? Dana, you were a terrible child, I would assume. The amount of drugs and alcohol you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=28.24s)]
*  participated in. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=34.8s)]
*  That Travis. You forgot the vandalism. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=36.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=38.8s)]
*  That was a bad one. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=39.8s)]
*  You're a bad kid. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=40.8s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, so my mom has since apologized. I used to get the wooden spoon. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=41.8s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=47.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=48.44s)]
*  Yeah. But you know what? It worked. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=49.44s)]
*  It did work. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=50.44s)]
*  I'm not against it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=51.44s)]
*  Yeah. The wooden spoon, I had a fly swatter. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=53.44s)]
*  Ow, that one hurts too. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=56.08s)]
*  The fly swatter being chased with a fly swatter, Jesse. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=57.08s)]
*  Did they catch you? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Yes, they caught me many times. I was a slow child. I never got the belt though. Everybody [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  got the belt. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=65.28s)]
*  I'll give you the belt. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=66.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=67.28s)]
*  Come here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=68.28s)]
*  What about you, Jesse? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=70.28s)]
*  I had to mow my dad's croquet cork. Got in a lot of trouble. And the mower actually got [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=71.28s)]
*  caught up in the wicket. And then the wicket came and hit the poodle in the tail. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=77.44s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=80.64s)]
*  We had to take it to the vet. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=81.64s)]
*  That's such a Jesse Waters childhood. I had to mow my dad's croquet cork. And then we [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=83.0s)]
*  had ice tea in the veranda. And it actually came over. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=89.16s)]
*  What about you? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=93.32s)]
*  The butler took the poodle to the vet there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=94.32s)]
*  You're one to talk, Harold. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=97.24s)]
*  I'll never forget second grade. It was biggest and most memorable. In second grade, I played [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=100.8s)]
*  somewhere at school. And my principal, a woman named Hattie Jackson, brought me into her [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=105.4s)]
*  office and she said, this is going to hurt me more than it hurts you. And she hit me [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=109.48s)]
*  seven times with a wooden paddle. I never went back to the principal's office again. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=114.2s)]
*  I never played in the woods again. We were not allowed to play in some area and I did [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  it. And then I got home and my mom used the belt because I embarrassed my parents at school [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  by getting a paddle. Never got a paddle again. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=128.04s)]
*  Kennedy, what about you? You were a precocious child. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=131.68s)]
*  Thank you, Greg. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=134.76s)]
*  You know, my parents were Democrats. And when I was in high school, my senior year, I actually [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=136.4s)]
*  snuck to the Republican convention. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=142.56s)]
*  Rebel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  In Seaside. And my mom worked for the phone company. So I told her I was at a friend's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  house but I was really in Seaside, Oregon. And so she went to work and checked where [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=151.6s)]
*  the call came in from when I called her collect because we didn't have cell phones back in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=156.76s)]
*  the 1940s, Jesse. And that was the only time in my childhood I got grounded. My mom went [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=161.36s)]
*  home and she was like, I wasn't mad that I was gone. It was the fact that I went to the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=166.36s)]
*  Republican convention. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=168.96s)]
*  I don't think I ever was grounded. I got suspended and expelled from school but never like that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=171.28s)]
*  My parents never did anything. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=176.22000000000003s)]
*  What did you get expelled for? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=177.22000000000003s)]
*  It's a long story, but I was able to come back to school. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=179.8s)]
*  Me too. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. It was amazing. You know, when they couldn't find the victim, the charges were [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  dropped. It had to do with firecrackers in the classroom and then threatening a teacher. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  The victim probably took a wicket to the throat. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=193.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=196.56s)]
*  But I made it to teacher. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=197.56s)]
*  Yes. Long story. Roseanne asks, if you could only eat one thing for the rest of your life, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=198.56s)]
*  what would it be? This is so easy. Kennedy, what would you eat? I know that you're gluten [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=206.12s)]
*  intolerant. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=211.56s)]
*  Yes. Greg, I have celiac and I would like to take this moment for a wonderful public [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=212.56s)]
*  service announcement to save your small intestine. It would probably be my mom's gluten-free [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  chocolate chip cookies. Now I got to butter up because I'm very sure about the whole Republican [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=225.64s)]
*  thing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=229.92s)]
*  Yes. Gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, Harold. What about you? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=230.92s)]
*  If I didn't worry about my vanity, if I was not worried about my weight, I would have [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=234.48s)]
*  ice cream and chocolate chip cookies every day. But even so, I'd eat sweet potatoes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=238.44s)]
*  I love sweet potatoes. I only get them on Thanksgiving, really, but I love sweet potatoes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=242.92s)]
*  Sweet potatoes. That's so lame. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=246.92s)]
*  I would probably just to mess with you, shrimp. Because I know how much you hate shellfish [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=249.16s)]
*  I hate shellfish, but I used to have shrimp as a child, but I got out of it. I had a shrimp [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=255.92s)]
*  cocktail because I liked the taste of the sauce. Yes, it was really good. Shrimp cocktail. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=260.2s)]
*  Speaking of shrimp cocktail, you're quite a shrimp cocktail. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=266.32s)]
*  Yes, I am. I would have steak all day long, every day, every day, all the time. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  I would say pizza because you can do anything with a pizza. So if you feel like having a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=274.4s)]
*  meat or vegetables, any kind of pizza will do. I think I won that round. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=279.6s)]
*  I think I did. I think Jesse lost. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=285.12s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, or lost. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=286.64s)]
*  What is the best book you ever read? This is from Nina. Harold, why don't you go first [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=289.04s)]
*  and say the Bible. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=294.88s)]
*  1984, George Orwell. I read it in seventh grade. I got a B on the test, but it changed [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  my life. It really got me into reading, but it might have gotten me into critical thinking. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=303.44s)]
*  Good for you. Too bad it didn't pay off. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=307.68s)]
*  Jesse? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=311.6s)]
*  The Hobbit is my answer for every literary question. First book that pops into my head, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=312.16s)]
*  I'm going to go Hobbit. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=318.24s)]
*  Dana? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=321.12s)]
*  I would say I read A Wrinkle in Time over and over and over again as a kid. And then [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  actually it was funny because a couple years ago then that book was there was some controversy [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=328.24s)]
*  about it. It was that anniversary. It was like, that might have turned kids Republican [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  or libertarian. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=335.68s)]
*  Was it a time travel thing? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  But also when you went to the time travel is basically you live like a communist and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  nobody wanted to live in communism. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=341.92s)]
*  I'm definitely going to read that last year. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=343.36s)]
*  Get it? Kennedy? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  Yes. Two, I love Jane Eyre. That's like one of the few books that I've read over and over [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=347.92s)]
*  again, but a book that absolutely changed the way I see the world was called An Essay [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=353.04s)]
*  on Man by Ernst Kassirer. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=358.8s)]
*  Oh, Ernst. How is he doing? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  Not alive. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=362.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=364.0s)]
*  I don't know. I was thinking my favorite book I always talked about was Blood Meridian by [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=365.12s)]
*  Cormac McCarthy. And then I've read a couple and then I read it again and I'm going like, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=369.44s)]
*  maybe it wasn't as great as I remember it. But I don't know. But I guess I should just [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=372.88s)]
*  say Blood Meridian. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=377.68s)]
*  It's a good one. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a good book. All right. This is from Dorothy. Dorothy T. What is one food you [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=379.68s)]
*  refuse to eat? I guess I should go to you, Jessie. Is there anything you won't eat? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=387.12s)]
*  Soup. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=391.92s)]
*  In public, it's an embarrassment for men to be seen slurping soup from a spoon. And that's [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=393.2s)]
*  why I don't do it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  It is interesting. Why can't you just drink soup? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=400.64s)]
*  Out of a thermos? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=403.52s)]
*  Yes. Just drink it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=404.48s)]
*  On a hike, perhaps. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=405.36s)]
*  Exactly. Like little beef barley. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=406.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=408.56s)]
*  Little bouillon cube. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=409.44s)]
*  Bouillon cube? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=412.0s)]
*  Bouillon. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=412.8s)]
*  Bouillon. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=413.52s)]
*  Bouillon. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=414.16s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=416.08s)]
*  I don't know either. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=416.88s)]
*  I don't know either. You actually do your yoga exercises on a bouillon cube. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=417.76s)]
*  Hey, Kennedy. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=422.8s)]
*  What food do you refuse to eat? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=424.16s)]
*  There's only one. I will eat anything. I've eaten the weirdest food. I don't think I should say [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  this out loud, but I've eaten a body part from several different animals. I have something to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  eat, to drink in Zimbabwe that cannot be mentioned on a family program. So the only thing I would not [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=438.88s)]
*  eat is gluten. Something containing gluten. That's it. Everything else on the table. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=444.16s)]
*  Dana? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=448.24s)]
*  There are so many things, but the things I'm writing down are snake, alligator, snails. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=448.88s)]
*  Like any of that weird stuff, I would never. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=453.2s)]
*  I've eaten all of it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=455.52s)]
*  I made Johnny eat escargot one time. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=457.12s)]
*  Disgusting. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=459.2s)]
*  Yeah. He didn't even know what it was. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=459.76s)]
*  Poor guy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=461.04s)]
*  That's what you told him anyway. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=461.52s)]
*  Did it taste like chicken? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=461.92s)]
*  I've eaten a lot, but I won't eat black olives and I'm allergic to shellfish. Black olives. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  Black olives? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=468.56s)]
*  Doesn't agree with me. Just doesn't, whatever. It makes my, it's not good. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=468.96s)]
*  I'm going to go with lobster. I don't like how they're treated. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  Same. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=476.48s)]
*  You're not serious. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=476.96s)]
*  No, I've never had lobster in my life. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=477.92s)]
*  You've never eaten it on Jesse's croquet lawn. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes, that's true. Yes. All right. What's the dumbest thing you ever did as a kid? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  I already know Dana's answer because this question comes up every year. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=490.16s)]
*  Again, again. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=493.44s)]
*  Yeah, so don't bring up the plane story. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to play, that's a bad one. A dumb thing I did as a kid, as a little kid. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=495.6s)]
*  Well, I would say, you know, I chose gymnastics over piano when I was forced to make a choice. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=501.76s)]
*  Because I couldn't have like that many lessons in a week and we have to like, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=508.16s)]
*  you know, we have to pay for lessons and everything. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=510.8s)]
*  And I chose gymnastics I should have kept with piano. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=512.48s)]
*  Wow. Your whole life would have changed. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=515.28s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't be here. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=517.44s)]
*  No, that is true. And you'd be tall. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=518.48s)]
*  That's true. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=520.64s)]
*  I don't know. Does gymnastics stunt your growth? That wasn't my problem. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  There was a secret bookshelf in my grandfather's library that we discovered and we went down, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=526.16s)]
*  it's where he kept his rare whiskeys and I accidentally shattered like a $10,000 bottle. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=532.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=537.12s)]
*  You did? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=537.84s)]
*  You looked at that part where you found all that Nazi memorabilia. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=539.12s)]
*  What? Take that out. It was Mussolini. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=542.96s)]
*  Harold? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  I thought that I could be Evo Knievel on a moped. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=551.92s)]
*  And we went, my brothers made this little thing, the ramp didn't really last and then I got, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=556.08s)]
*  I fell off, thank God I didn't break my neck. But it was fun. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=561.92s)]
*  It was fun. I'm not Evo Knievel, I realized. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=564.88s)]
*  No, you aren't. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=567.12s)]

*  decided to drop in on a half pipe and I got a concussion and had to go to the hospital in an [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=574.88s)]
*  ambulance. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=579.92s)]

*  You were a wild little lady, weren't you? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=581.92s)]
*  It was wild. The rest of it I can't remember because of the concussion. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  I was smoking cigarettes. I was young, I remember buying cigarettes in a machine [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  at Macy's. You'd go downstairs into the hallway, put money in and kind of me and this guy Bob. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=593.76s)]
*  Yeah, we went to the high school, we smoked cigarettes and then I came home and I spilled [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=599.76s)]
*  my guts without them even asking. My mom said, hey, what did you guys do? And I go, who smoked? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UPVx6UhCD8&t=605.1999999999999s)]
