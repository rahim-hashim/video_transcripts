# ‘The Five’: Trump filets ABC News for being ‘fake’
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250)
*  Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Judge Jeanne Pirro, Jessica Tarloff, Jesse Waters, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=0.0s)]
*  she lists the seven dwarfs as her emergency contacts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Dana Perino, the Five. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=8.4s)]
*  Jesse and Dana are in D.C., thank God, and they're not doing a 12-hour sit-in with Spartacus. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=16.56s)]
*  We'll tell you what they're up to later. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=21.68s)]
*  But first, the President Trump is getting a head start on the next 100 days by showing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=24.32s)]
*  America how the sausage is made. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  DJT hosting a two-hour long cabinet meeting. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=29.92s)]
*  Core GDP, and this is, you know, you probably saw some numbers today, and I have to start [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  off by saying that's Biden. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=39.6s)]
*  That's not Trump because we came in on January, this is quarterly numbers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=41.68s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, I don't think I've ever worked so hard to try to fire myself. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=45.2s)]
*  They say I wear a lot of hats. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=49.160000000000004s)]
*  We all want to thank you for your help, too. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  You really have sacrificed a lot. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=58.16s)]
*  You've been treated very unfairly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=60.16s)]
*  You're invited to stay as long as you want. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=62.16s)]
*  At some point, I guess he wants to get back home to his car. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=65.16s)]
*  Trump also celebrating 100 days of kicking the left's butt, Jessica, by going back on [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=71.16s)]
*  the rally circuit, doing his signature dance in Michigan, while basking in the glow of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=76.36s)]
*  the MAGA maniacs. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  And it wouldn't be vintage Trump if he wasn't smacking the liberal media. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=82.76s)]
*  Silly. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=85.76s)]
*  They're giving you the big break of a lifetime. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=86.76s)]
*  You know, you're doing the interview. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=88.76s)]
*  I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but that's okay. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=90.26s)]
*  You think Vladimir Putin wants peace? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=93.26s)]
*  I think he does, yes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=95.76s)]
*  Do you trust him? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=97.26s)]
*  I think— [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=98.26s)]
*  Do you trust him? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=98.76s)]
*  I don't trust you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=99.26s)]
*  I don't trust a lot of people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=100.26s)]
*  I don't trust you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=102.26s)]
*  Look at you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=103.26s)]
*  You come in all shooting for bear. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=103.76s)]
*  You're so happy to do the interview. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=105.26s)]
*  I am happy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=106.76s)]
*  And then you start hitting me with fake questions. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=107.26s)]
*  We had a president that was grossly incompetent. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=109.26s)]
*  You knew it, I knew it, and everybody knew it, but you guys didn't want to write it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=111.76s)]
*  because you're fake news. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=115.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=116.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=117.26s)]
*  And by the way, ABC is one of the worst, I have to be honest with you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=118.26s)]
*  So, Dana, you look lovely outside. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=124.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=127.76s)]
*  That's great. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=128.76s)]
*  Okay, enough phony stuff. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=129.76s)]
*  I want to start with that just interview right there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=130.76s)]
*  I think, like, after the Biden cover-up, it's not Trump that's being tested. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=134.26s)]
*  It's the media that has to be tested. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=140.76s)]
*  He has nothing to prove. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=143.26s)]
*  They do, and I think that's how he structures these interviews. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=144.76s)]
*  He has nothing left to say to them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=148.26s)]
*  They have to prove to him that he's unbiased. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=150.26s)]
*  Well, I think that it does say something about President Trump. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=153.76s)]
*  He is literally willing to talk to anybody. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=156.76s)]
*  And they've had an incredible push for their 100 days. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=160.26s)]
*  And I know it's a media construct, but you know what? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=165.26s)]
*  Use what you have. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=168.26s)]
*  Use the tools at your disposal. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=169.76s)]
*  And so that's the one that they tried with this one. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=171.26s)]
*  ABC News, interesting choice. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=173.26s)]
*  It didn't go with David Muir or Lindsey, who did the debate, if you'll remember that one. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=174.76s)]
*  But I do think I admire him for wanting to get out there, be willing to take the interview. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=180.26s)]
*  It's interesting to me that Terry Moran said yes, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=186.26s)]
*  Because you know going in that this is a possibility. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=189.76s)]
*  And I think we got something out of it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=193.76s)]
*  But on the Biden point in particular, ABC News was the chosen entity for all sorts of news from the Biden administration. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=196.26s)]
*  Listen to their podcast called Start Here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=205.26s)]
*  They were always having Mayor Pete, he would go on to talk about something specific coming on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=207.26s)]
*  If you had something from the Department of Energy, then they would have that guy or that woman come on. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=212.26s)]
*  It was always ABC News who got the story. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=216.76s)]
*  But the question is, Greg, to your point, how did they miss the story? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=219.26s)]
*  Everybody acted like it was a surprise on June 27th, 2024, when Biden and Trump debated. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=224.26s)]
*  So yes, they have a whole of their own to crawl out of and comes to numbers. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=231.26s)]
*  I remember one time being at the White House years ago and a reporter said, your numbers are terrible. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=236.26s)]
*  Your poll numbers are terrible. What is President Bush going to do? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=240.26s)]
*  And I was able to say there's only two entities in Washington with lower approval numbers than us, Congress and the media. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=243.26s)]
*  And it's only gotten worse. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=250.26s)]
*  Well said. You know, Jesse Trump keeps rolling along. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=252.26s)]
*  To him, a hundred days is just like is just a number like Pritzker's weight or your IQ. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=256.26s)]
*  Do you think he pays attention to this stuff? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=264.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's why he had a rally, a sit down with ABC and a cabinet meeting. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=267.26s)]
*  I mean, he did more in one day than Biden did in a hundred. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=272.26s)]
*  But I just want to know where the bad ombre mugshots are behind Dana. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=275.26s)]
*  Did you do something, Dana, with the mugshots? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=279.26s)]
*  I literally just got through security. I didn't have time to do anything. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=282.26s)]
*  OK, good. So, yeah, he's busy. There's no lids. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=285.26s)]
*  There's no doctor checking to see if he has Alzheimer's. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=289.26s)]
*  The vice president's not lining up judges to swear in case the president drops dead. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=292.26s)]
*  The vice president's doing what he should be doing, trying to steal Greenland. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=297.26s)]
*  And so right now we're in a really good place. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=301.26s)]
*  He's crushing it on culture, crushing it on the border, and he's crushing on a waste fraud and abuse. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=304.26s)]
*  And the rest of the agenda, we're waiting on deals, peace deals, trade deals, tax deals. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=308.26s)]
*  And I wouldn't doubt that these deals are going to get done because he's already done a lot. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=314.26s)]
*  He's already done a deal with Panama to kick China out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=318.26s)]
*  He's done deals with big law firms. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=321.26s)]
*  They're now like funding him to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=323.26s)]
*  We did a deal with Boeing to get new fighter jets. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=327.26s)]
*  We got deals galore. This is what he loves to do. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=330.26s)]
*  And you're right, he talks to anyone, Greg. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=333.26s)]
*  Bill Maher, he even talks to you. He even did Exclamation Point. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=335.26s)]
*  Now, ABC's in trouble. That was the worst thing I've ever seen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=340.26s)]
*  They couldn't do it with Muir because his fact checks all backfired at the debate. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=344.26s)]
*  They couldn't do it with Stephanopoulos because he couldn't keep his mouth shut. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=347.26s)]
*  And he caught the brass $15 million, and now it's funding the presidential library. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=350.26s)]
*  So they went with a third stringer. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=355.26s)]
*  And the third stringer came in way too hot. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=357.26s)]
*  Trump does his best when he's confronted. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=361.26s)]
*  And he just steam-drolled this guy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=364.26s)]
*  You know what I would have done if I was ABC? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=367.26s)]
*  I would have had Stephen A do it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=369.26s)]
*  He's a Disney guy. He's an ABC guy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=371.26s)]
*  Put Stephen A in there, and that's a great interview. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=373.26s)]
*  Interesting point, Jesse. I'm lying. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=377.26s)]
*  Judge, there's criticism from the media that these cabinet meetings are too deferential. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=381.26s)]
*  What do they expect to happen in a meeting with the president? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=386.26s)]
*  Are they supposed to throw punches? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=390.26s)]
*  Yeah, they're supposed to say, you know, Mr. President, we don't like you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=392.26s)]
*  We don't want this job. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=395.26s)]
*  But, you know, look, the amazing part of the cabinet meetings is that this cabinet, they really like each other. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=396.26s)]
*  You could tell. And they say it. They talk to each other all the time, if not several times a day. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=404.26s)]
*  They are totally in sync. They are working together toward one agenda. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=409.26s)]
*  They are following through on the president's promises that he promised America [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=413.26s)]
*  that he would make sure that the border would be closed, that he would turn the economy back. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=418.26s)]
*  And as we watch with Biden, as industries crumbled and there was unfair trade and there was cashless mail [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=423.26s)]
*  and all of these crazy things that were happening that caused prices to go up, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=430.26s)]
*  this president comes in and he's got a team behind him of people who want to support him, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=434.26s)]
*  whether it's politically or economically or in terms of trade or in terms of education, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=440.26s)]
*  civil rights, they're all on the same page. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=447.26s)]
*  And you know what? For all of the criticism that he has taken over these hundred days, you know, with Doge, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=450.26s)]
*  it's going to be terrible. Name one person who didn't get their Social Security check, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=456.26s)]
*  one person who got thrown off of Medicaid. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=461.26s)]
*  I mean, it's all scared by the Democrats to try to make sure that people don't accept anything that the president's doing. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=463.26s)]
*  And by the way, consumer spending is up 1.8 percent. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=470.26s)]
*  Business investment is up 21.9 percent when Biden left it down by 5.6 percent, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=475.26s)]
*  which makes it a 28 percent increase. Disposable personal income is up. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=482.26s)]
*  So you've got this president who has done things in three months that the Democrats have caused the problems for. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=488.26s)]
*  And he's just trying to come back. But be rest assured, firm convictions. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=496.26s)]
*  He's not backing down. It's what he ran on and he's not going to slow down. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=501.26s)]
*  Jessica, you get the remaining 20 seconds to respond. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=506.26s)]
*  What do you make of the judge's analysis? I don't see any holes in it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=511.26s)]
*  I see a few. It's like it's Swiss cheese. That's the holiest of all the cheeses. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=515.26s)]
*  She's looking at me and smiling at me. We just have to keep looking ahead. So those of you at home know we're still friends. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=521.26s)]
*  I heard he has nothing to prove. The cabinet's totally in sync and he's crushing it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=526.26s)]
*  And if any of that were true, he wouldn't be out there lying about any of everything from election results to how his first 100 days has been. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=532.26s)]
*  It is the worst first 100 days for a president in 70 years. That's not true. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=541.26s)]
*  It's objectively true. No, it's not objectively true. We can't interrupt what we're in. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=546.26s)]
*  No, it's based on the data on approval rating. That's what it's based on. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=550.26s)]
*  The approval ratings for all of the presidents and his being the lowest. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=555.26s)]
*  The GDP number today was negative point three percent. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=559.26s)]
*  It was two point four percent in Biden's last quarter. That's why he was out there today freaking out. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=565.26s)]
*  That's why he's posting about the stock market and saying this is Biden's stock market when he took responsibility for it on January 29th. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=571.26s)]
*  And he said, oh, this is my stock market. Now he doesn't want it anymore. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=578.26s)]
*  And to quote the philosopher king, Dave Portnoy, don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=582.26s)]
*  This is Donald Trump's stock market. This is his economy. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=589.26s)]
*  And the tariffs that he's implementing are destroying the economy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=593.26s)]
*  He could have just come in and continued on the course that we were and made some modifications. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=597.26s)]
*  You want to put more tariffs on China, probably get a lot of Democratic support for that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=601.26s)]
*  But coming in and doing these blanket tariffs and blowing up our system, we have ports that are empty as a result, waiting for those ships to come in that can't come here. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=606.26s)]
*  We're going to have shelving problems by the end of May. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=614.26s)]
*  His I guess his platform is I'm kind of the Grinch. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=617.26s)]
*  Did you hear him talking about Christmas time and how many dolls you're going to get? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=620.26s)]
*  So the little girl, she was going to get 30 dolls, but now she's only going to get two dolls. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=624.26s)]
*  The man who brought back Christmas isn't going to deliver for little Cindy Lou who? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=629.26s)]
*  Well, you know what this is like. We're not getting Social Security. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=634.26s)]
*  You're not there was a man in Seattle who didn't get a Social Security. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=637.26s)]
*  By the way, Joe Biden in two consecutive quarters had a decline of one point six and point nine. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=640.26s)]
*  OK, we're talking about zero point three. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=647.26s)]
*  Give the man a chance to remedy the economy. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=649.26s)]
*  Two point four percent in three years. Remedy to the economy. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=652.26s)]
*  Look, the Democrats are the ones who are willing to give everyone the money. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=655.26s)]
*  For AID and USAID, green energy, NGOs, all the scams. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=660.26s)]
*  Trump is putting an end to it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=665.26s)]
*  And you know what? Everything's going to be a golden age, Jessica. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=667.26s)]
*  And you know it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=670.26s)]
*  All right. Back in the boxes, just like old times. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=671.26s)]
*  Up next, Democrats are holding slumber parties to stop Trump. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYhQgIW250&t=677.26s)]
