# Gutfeld: Nobody knows where George Clooney stands
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0)
*  The Bidens can't seem to escape the Clooney coup as reports continue to swirl that Joe, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=0.0s)]
*  oh that was like I mixed them up, Joe and Jill went back into politics and the duo were seen [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  yucking it up on Broadway with Hollywood stars this weekend. While Clooney's colleagues were [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=10.4s)]
*  schmoozing with the Bidens, the upbeat king himself says he has no regrets on sinking Biden. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  I feel as if there was a lot of profiles and cowardice in my party through all of that and I [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=21.68s)]
*  was not proud of that and I also believed I had to tell the truth. And Clooney isn't the only one [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=28.96s)]
*  tired of Biden, his own aides and Democratic allies don't want him anywhere near the party, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=35.44s)]
*  some calling the idea of having Joe around again a joke or an SNL skit. Greg, it's like the Democrats [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=40.56s)]
*  cannot read the room. The Bidens were voted out. I think you know Clooney's charm is that he always [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  seems restrained, you know he's the opposite of radical but the weird thing is without a horse to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=55.28s)]
*  back do you really know what he believes in? Like I know what he's against, he's against Trump [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  but in this new world of common sense what does he align with? Is he, he might have way more in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=68.16s)]
*  common with Trump than he is with the progressives. The question is does he have the bravery to say [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=74.64s)]
*  that? I have no idea where he stands on the border, sanctuary cities or trans extremism. How does he [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=79.52s)]
*  feel about the fires in LA? Is he happy with how it was handled by Mayor What's-her-face and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=86.0s)]
*  Governor Who's-his-name? You know so when he talks about cowardice he waited a long time but he should [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=92.96s)]
*  have the guts to maybe say that his friends in Hollywood like John Floyd or Mel Gibson or [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Sylvester Stallone who shared a risk might have been right on a few things. He's starring in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=106.0s)]
*  Glengarry Glen Ross am I right? No it's Good Night and Good Luck. Oh never mind I was going to say [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=110.48s)]
*  I mean they have tremendous respect for David Mamet. David Mamet is one of the most conservative [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=115.68s)]
*  people so maybe instead of just sitting in silence you should actually speak up for some of the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=121.92s)]
*  people who shared the risk in Hollywood. That's bravery. And I didn't like this part judge he says [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=127.76s)]
*  I was raised to tell the truth but he didn't tell the truth until after the Biden Trump debate when [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=133.68s)]
*  Obama was basically like can you write this op-ed and try to get him out because just two weeks [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=139.92s)]
*  before they had that big Hollywood thing where Biden had problems and George Clooney said [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=143.76s)]
*  everybody in the audience give me your money so that I can pass it on to Joe Biden because I'm [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  here to do a fundraiser for him because he's the best thing for the next four years and two weeks [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  later he writes the op-ed. Well I think as you said on your show today they were waiting for the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=159.12s)]
*  checks to clear and in addition to that look George Clooney doesn't impress me he really doesn't and I [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=163.52s)]
*  honestly don't care what he thinks about the border or anything else. I think you know this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=170.96s)]
*  this Johnny come lately you know I was raised to be honest is a bunch of BS all right Obama told [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=176.56s)]
*  him to do it he sees himself as this extremely important person I think he's an arrogant [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=183.44s)]
*  condescending smug individual who thinks that you know he should be able to tell people in in America [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=189.12s)]
*  and the Democrat party certainly what they should and shouldn't do. This president Joe Biden is one [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=195.44s)]
*  of the most disastrous presidents that we've had in American history. I don't think there's any [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=202.16s)]
*  question about it. What he did with the border what he did with the with Afghanistan I mean the man [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=206.8s)]
*  was an embarrassment and in the end you know this whole idea and I'll just jump into this for a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=212.0s)]
*  second that Joe and Jill you know they want to they want to get involved and help the Democrats [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=219.68s)]
*  out. The Democrats want no part of them and nobody's going to take them up on it and so I think [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=225.68s)]
*  it's interesting that when he went to the play no one booed him yet they booed JD Vance at the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=230.72s)]
*  Kennedy Center and I'm just curious as to whether or not he fell asleep during the play. I might have. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=237.68s)]
*  Jessica would you like to see somebody like Clooney try to run? I don't think necessarily Clooney but [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=244.4s)]
*  there is an appetite for people outside of the normal political class obviously Mark Cuban is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=251.84s)]
*  testing the waters on that I've heard people talking about the rock like mixing it up worked [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  for the Republicans and it gave a wider range of voters people who are not necessarily concerned [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=262.4s)]
*  with politics the chance to connect with someone on a more pop culture level right or to hear a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  couple of things that they liked and then to show up at the polls and vote for them and so I think [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=272.96s)]
*  there will definitely be people who work in business maybe someone in entertainment that tries it. I [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=277.44s)]
*  don't think it'll be Clooney but this is what Clooney is talking about is going to be very [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=282.23999999999995s)]
*  important for the rebirth of the party and how 2028 goes because people who are running for [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=287.76s)]
*  president are going to have to answer about 2024 and what they really thought was going on and if [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=292.88s)]
*  there are any mea culpa's about it that if you just say we had to hang on because we needed to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=298.08s)]
*  win the election I think that actually is a legitimate argument to make you thought there [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=302.88s)]
*  was an existential threat the American public disagreed with us though but you're going to have [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=307.2s)]
*  to answer it. Still have no idea what he believes in. George Clooney? Yeah. Yeah. Why what do you mean? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=311.2s)]
*  Well no my my point is it's like everything everything that Trump has done is right in the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=317.2s)]
*  meat of common sense so whoever who's Clooney is Clooney going to just stick with the progressive [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=323.44s)]
*  side which is killing your party or not? No what do you think Jesse? Well Clooney just called his [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=329.44s)]
*  party a bunch of lying cowards so do you want to be in a party that are surrounded by a bunch of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=334.32s)]
*  lying cowards? I don't know maybe he will run for president. A Democrat who tells the truth [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=338.96s)]
*  we'll see how that shakes out. Swalwell was at a White House picnic in 2023 went up to Joe Biden [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=344.16s)]
*  said hi how are you doing sir? Joe Biden didn't recognize him. Joe Biden was on the debate stage [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=351.12s)]
*  in the primary he knew who Swalwell was. Swalwell was on tv all the time he had no idea who Swalwell [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  was and for the next year and a half Swalwell didn't say anything and defended Joe Biden said [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  he was sharp said he was much better than Trump he was willing to let Joe Biden run the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=367.76000000000005s)]
*  country into the ground just because he didn't want Trump to run the country it's pretty pathetic [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=374.08s)]
*  Jessica if you ask me even though no one asked. Do you have Swalwell on the show tonight? No we [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE4unf0v5j0&t=378.96s)]
