# ‘PARTICIPATION TROPHY’: Biden’s role in cease-fire deal under scrutiny
**Fox News - The Five:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds)
*  All hell will break out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=0.0s)]
*  If those hostages aren't back, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=1.76s)]
*  I don't want to hurt your negotiation. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  If they're not back by the time I get into office, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=6.44s)]
*  all hell will break out in the Middle East. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=9.14s)]
*  And it will not be good for Hamas, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=12.32s)]
*  and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=14.84s)]
*  All hell will break out. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=16.76s)]
*  Turns out all hell will break out worked. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=18.76s)]
*  Israel and Hamas reaching a ceasefire deal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=20.84s)]
*  that will release hostages over a six-week period. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=23.32s)]
*  It'll be done in different phases, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=26.68s)]
*  with 33 hostages expected to be released over 42 days. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=28.36s)]
*  In exchange, Israel will release [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=32.72s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=34.2s)]
*  President-elect Trump celebrating the news on truth, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=36.4s)]
*  saying, quote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=39.16s)]
*  this epic ceasefire agreement could have only happened [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=40.2s)]
*  as a result of our historic victory in November. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=43.28s)]
*  But, of course, Joe Biden wants all the credit, too, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  despite Donald Trump getting praised by Arab officials [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=49.56s)]
*  who say Trump did more to free hostages [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  and reach the ceasefire than Biden did all year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=54.56s)]
*  Joe rolling out with his squad, Kamala and Tony B, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=57.64s)]
*  to act like he did all the hard work [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=60.84s)]
*  and insisting people blame his successor [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=63.0s)]
*  if it all falls apart. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=65.76s)]
*  We're handing off, then, to the next team [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=68.44s)]
*  a real opportunity for a better future for the Middle East. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=70.28s)]
*  I hope they will take it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=74.28s)]
*  This is the exact framework of the deal [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=76.0s)]
*  I proposed back in May. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=77.8s)]
*  Exact. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=79.4s)]
*  And we got the world to endorse it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=81.04s)]
*  Told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=84.72s)]
*  to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=88.24s)]
*  Because that's what American presidents do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=92.2s)]
*  ... credit for this, Mr. President, you or Trump? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=94.28s)]
*  Is that a joke? Oh. Thank you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=99.16s)]
*  The battle for credit, Dana. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=104.4s)]
*  That'll probably happen for a while here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=106.44s)]
*  I think it's pretty obvious [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=108.8s)]
*  that if this were going to get done under Biden, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=112.56s)]
*  it would have been done before now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=115.24s)]
*  And it's being done under the... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  Certainly, some of the conditions were the same, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  but when Biden says the exact same, that's not exactly true. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=121.84s)]
*  Because a couple things have happened. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=125.0s)]
*  One, the Israelis are now in much more of a position of strength [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=126.24s)]
*  than they were earlier in the summer. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=129.4s)]
*  Last May, we hadn't had the Pager explosions. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=130.64s)]
*  We hadn't had Nasrallah decimated. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=134.04s)]
*  We didn't have Hezbollah on the run. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=136.04s)]
*  We didn't have... Assad was in Syria. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=138.28s)]
*  Iran hadn't had all of the problems. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli defense forces are the ones that put Israel [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=142.76s)]
*  in a better position to negotiate [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=145.8s)]
*  and to be able to use President Trump's push [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=148.56s)]
*  in order to get it done. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=151.28s)]
*  But there's another thing that's really important. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=152.04s)]
*  In that first deal, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=154.2s)]
*  they said that Israel would have to declare an end to the war. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=157.4s)]
*  In this ceasefire agreement, they do not have to say that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=160.48s)]
*  That's an important thing for them, for their psyche, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=163.68s)]
*  especially because as these hostages start to come out, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=166.04s)]
*  first of all, we have to all understand [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=169.52s)]
*  that many of them are deceased. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=171.08s)]
*  So you're going to get bodies back. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  Also, think about if you have the women that are coming out, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=175.56s)]
*  the ones who have been held, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=178.8s)]
*  and the stories they are going to tell [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=180.08s)]
*  that will bring the country to its knees. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  And we're going to have to be there for them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  These hostages have lived underground, in Gaza, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  longer than the Americans were in Tehran. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=189.52s)]
*  And so there's credit to go around. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=193.36s)]
*  There's blame to go around. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=196.44s)]
*  I do think that we should give some credit to the Israelis [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=197.28s)]
*  because now what the IDF can do is to help us [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=199.4s)]
*  by decimating all of those other terrorist organizations [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  and not having to declare an end to the war. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=207.4s)]
*  They can now help turn the attention to the Houthis [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=209.44s)]
*  who continue to cause all the problems [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=212.12s)]
*  in that area of the world. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=213.84s)]
*  And I think the IDF deserves a lot of credit here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=214.96s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  Jesse Waters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  How do you think about this ceasefire here? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=219.76s)]
*  Well, you know, credit fights always seem kind of petty, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=221.36s)]
*  but I'm petty. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=225.0s)]
*  To me, Joe can take all the credit he wants, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  but it's a participation trophy, right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, it's like saying you won the Super Bowl, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=233.28s)]
*  but you're on the practice squad. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=235.84s)]
*  They do give you a ring, but it's a small, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  much smaller, more plain ring. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=241.36s)]
*  I do, you know, the timing says everything. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  It's like, come on. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=247.8s)]
*  Trump makes this promise that you're going to die [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=249.84s)]
*  and suddenly this happens. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=252.68s)]
*  Come on. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=254.44s)]
*  Come on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=255.64s)]
*  He forced Hamas to do this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=256.96s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  I can't, I worry about, you know, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=260.56s)]
*  these people never actually agree to ceasefires anyway. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=265.64s)]
*  They're animals. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=269.96s)]
*  How do you trade prisoners with them [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=272.24s)]
*  without making their actions look like [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=274.36s)]
*  it's being rewarded unless you're dealing with Israel, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  who always have an ace up their sleeve, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  meaning whoever they trade, whatever prisoners are traded, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=284.08s)]
*  they probably have some slow acting poison, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  or perhaps they were internally air tagged [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=291.0s)]
*  so they could be exterminated when they get to their location, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=294.12s)]
*  perhaps with their friends. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=297.44s)]
*  But I think that like the one thing that we, you know, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=300.28s)]
*  you know what it is? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=303.28s)]
*  It's like that scene in Pope fiction [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=304.88s)]
*  where Bruce Willis rescues Ving Rhames from the Gimp [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=306.96s)]
*  and Ving Rhames says, no, I'm going to stay back [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  and I'm going to go medieval on him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  We're like Bruce Willis. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=319.12s)]
*  We're like going to go, you know what, Israel, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=320.35999999999996s)]
*  do what you have to do to the Gimp. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=322.76s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=325.24s)]
*  And that's the way it should be. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  They should wipe Hamas off the face of the earth [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  and we shouldn't care. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=332.76s)]
*  The Gimp session. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  That was a heck of an analogy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=335.2s)]
*  That movie scene was pretty powerful. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=336.4s)]
*  It really was. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  I still think about it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=338.88s)]
*  You were the Gimp for Halloween a couple of years back. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=340.52s)]
*  Not just Halloween. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=342.4s)]
*  Larry Kudlow's birthday. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=344.4s)]
*  Big day today. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=346.32s)]
*  It is. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=347.88s)]
*  I'm reminded of President Kennedy's words [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  after the Bay of Pigs fiasco [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=351.32s)]
*  when he said victory has a thousand fathers [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  and defeat is an orphan. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=355.64s)]
*  Two things can be right at once. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=358.56s)]
*  And the first is the transfer and fluidity [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  of US foreign policy and global power is unmatched. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  So listen to both Steve Witkoff and Marco Rubio, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  the designee for Secretary of State [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=373.48s)]
*  and our envoy, special envoy, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  talk about what they did with Jake Sullivan [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  and the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=380.2s)]
*  to say that we acted together. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=383.64s)]
*  Didn't they hear President Biden say what he said? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=385.0s)]
*  I think signals to the world [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=387.04s)]
*  as we talk about this peaceful transfer of power, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  how indeed real that is. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  Two, both of them deserve a lot of credit. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=393.72s)]
*  I'm not, it is not lost to me when President Trump, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=396.24s)]
*  who has a unique way of negotiating, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=399.16s)]
*  when he and Marilago with Witkoff on the stage with him, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  say they better know if this still doesn't get done, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=404.76s)]
*  it'll be hell to pay. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=407.36s)]
*  I don't want to interfere with the negotiation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=408.44s)]
*  Now, a normal person that would interfere [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=410.24s)]
*  with the negotiation, but President Trump [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=412.2s)]
*  is a unique figure and I give him great credit for that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  I did not notice in his words, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=417.56s)]
*  him saying that he didn't give some credit [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=419.44s)]
*  to the Biden administration for their work, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=421.68s)]
*  which I think is an incredibly important thing [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=423.52s)]
*  for him to do and for the world to know. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Finally, a lot of this now falls on our friends, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  the Saudis and the Israelis, our best allies in the region, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=432.24s)]
*  because this is only a six-week agreement. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=435.12s)]
*  You got 33 hostages, you got hundreds of, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=437.8s)]
*  as you mentioned in your opening, Jesse, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=440.24s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinians that will be released. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=441.68s)]
*  The Saudis and the Israelis are gonna have to manage this [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=445.2s)]
*  and my suspicion is they're gonna have a great partner [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=447.32s)]
*  in President Trump in managing this going forward. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=451.12s)]
*  So how do you feel about the deal, Judge Janine? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=454.0s)]
*  I think the way I analyze this is I look at the world [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=456.28s)]
*  when Donald Trump left office, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=460.08s)]
*  there was peace in the Middle East, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=462.88s)]
*  there were the Abraham Accords. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=464.76s)]
*  The Afghanistan withdrawal signaled to Iran [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  as well as to Russia that it's time to play [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  America's Not Gonna Stand Up to Us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=474.52s)]
*  And the fact that Donald Trump said what he said [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  was all hell's gonna break out. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=482.23999999999995s)]
*  And the fact that this deal will only be successful [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  based upon what Donald Trump does and what he demands, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=492.76000000000005s)]
*  to me is an indication that it is about Trump, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=496.92s)]
*  it is about the IDF, it is about Steve Witkoff, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=501.64000000000004s)]
*  it is about the fact that Hamas has been decimated, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=505.8s)]
*  Hezbollah has been crippled, Iran has been weakened, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=509.6s)]
*  Assad has been eliminated. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=514.72s)]
*  Okay, so I mean, let's recognize Israel did this [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=516.2800000000001s)]
*  at every turn Joe Biden was telling him, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=520.5200000000001s)]
*  not so fast, not so fast as if Israel wasn't fighting a war, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=523.0s)]
*  as if it was like, oh, you gotta go turn now, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=527.5200000000001s)]
*  you can go now, no, it's a war, it's a war to the end, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  people die and Joe Biden and his administration [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  did everything they could to make the Israelis [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=536.88s)]
*  look like they were not justified [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=539.88s)]
*  in destroying every Hamas member around the world. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=542.2s)]
*  So I see this as a tremendous opportunity, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=547.4000000000001s)]
*  I see this as the opportunity for the Middle East [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=551.1600000000001s)]
*  to grow economically as Harold always talks about, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=555.36s)]
*  but also it's really up to Trump to make sure [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=558.5200000000001s)]
*  that Hamas at this point plays no part in Gaza, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  and I have no doubt that he will. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  All right, well said. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxnVneS0Rds&t=568.96s)]
