# ‘The Five’: Dems refuse to admit they are 'dead wrong' on ‘Maryland dad’
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk)
*  The Democrats are looking dumber by the day, so they refuse to admit they were dead wrong [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=0.0s)]
*  about their precious Maryland man. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=4.8s)]
*  No matter how many disturbing details we find about Kilmar Abrego-Garcia's violent past [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=6.96s)]
*  as a suspected MS-13 member. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=11.6s)]
*  The latest shoot of Bust, a liberal narrative, cops just dropped new body cam video from [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=14.24s)]
*  2022 to Traffic Stop, with Tennessee state troopers getting mighty suspicious that Kilmar [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia was tied up in human trafficking. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=25.16s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=27.64s)]
*  You know what you got here, right? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=29.2s)]
*  Uh, no. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=31.2s)]
*  He's hauling these people for money. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=32.2s)]
*  There's eight people in there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=36.2s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=38.2s)]
*  They put an extra roll in suits. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=39.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=41.2s)]
*  So he's getting paid to all these people, probably to Maryland, I would say. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=42.2s)]
*  They don't have any luggage in there, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=45.2s)]
*  And if you get them out, they're going to have a toothpaste and they're going to have [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=47.2s)]
*  toothbrushes in their pockets, I guarantee you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=51.2s)]
*  He's got $1,400 cash in his pocket in an envelope. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=53.88s)]
*  And it gets worse. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=58.36s)]
*  Disturbing audio from 2020 surfaced, where Garcia's wife, Jennifer, begged the judge [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=59.36s)]
*  for protection from her husband and explaining in graphic detail how he hit her. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=64.56s)]
*  He grabbed me from my hair and then he slapped me and then the neighbor, like, he didn't [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=70.64s)]
*  know what to do, he didn't know what to react. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  I have pictures of the evidence, like all the bruises, because even on Wednesday, he [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=75.84s)]
*  hit me around like three in the morning, he would just wake up and like hit me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=80.52s)]
*  And then last Saturday for my daughter's birthday party, before I went to my daughter's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=84.44s)]
*  birthday party, he slapped me three times. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=88.32s)]
*  And then last week I did call the police, my sister called the police because he hit [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=91.36s)]
*  me in front of my sister. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=95.12s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's wife issued a statement to USA Today, which we obtained the audio. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=97.4s)]
*  She says her husband was, quote, traumatized by COVID and being in ICE detention, which [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=102.5s)]
*  contributed to the actions which caused her to seek the protective order. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=108.44s)]
*  But Democrats like Ilhan Omar are not interested in Garcia's violent past. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=112.48s)]
*  Do you think more of your Democratic colleagues should be traveling to El Salvador to advocate [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=117.28s)]
*  on behalf of Abrego Garcia? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  I think you should f*** off. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=122.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=124.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, what? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=125.0s)]
*  Congresswoman? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=126.0s)]
*  You should f*** off. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=127.0s)]
*  Who should? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=128.0s)]
*  You. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=129.0s)]
*  You know, I don't think a lot of American husbands or any husbands just start beating [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=130.0s)]
*  their wives during COVID because they were traumatized, Greg. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=133.72s)]
*  Well, clearly it was ICE's fault. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=136.84s)]
*  Look, Abrego is a Maryland man, right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=138.84s)]
*  Ted Bundy is a dating expert. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=142.28s)]
*  Unabomber is a pen pal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=145.72s)]
*  Charles Manson, family man. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=148.12s)]
*  I think Republicans and other sane people should be credited with unbelievable patience. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=150.44s)]
*  As we had to sit through the endless lionizing of a thug, they turned him into, I don't know, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=157.36s)]
*  Rosa Parks with tats. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=163.76s)]
*  You know, we knew it was inevitable. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=165.68s)]
*  It was just like Jussie Smollett where we had to like bite our tongues and let the Dems [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=168.16s)]
*  work through their five stages of performative outrage. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=173.52s)]
*  But we knew what was going to happen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  It was just going to take time. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=179.2s)]
*  And then what's going to happen? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=180.64s)]
*  They're going to pivot. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=181.64s)]
*  Suddenly, it's not about the Maryland dad at all. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=182.64s)]
*  It's about all of us. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=185.68s)]
*  This, you know, no, it's not about all of us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=187.0s)]
*  You made it about the Maryland dad. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=190.06s)]
*  This is the hill you chose to die on and you're going to die on it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=191.6s)]
*  They always seem to pick the wrong side on the wrong hill. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=195.28s)]
*  Trans athletes, left-wing congressmen who let dogs die, a guy who assassinates a CEO, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=198.84s)]
*  pro-Hamas protesters, BLM rioters, looters who are only trying to get bread, the white-beating [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=205.28s)]
*  gang banger. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=213.68s)]
*  If you want to find a scumbag, just look for the Democrat that's defending him. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=214.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, who do they demonize? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Daniel Penny, men who actually try to do good. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=220.72s)]
*  It's their filter, the oppressor versus the oppressed, which means if a bad guy is like [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=226.08s)]
*  financially worse off than you, he can't be the victim, which means every bad guy who's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=232.04s)]
*  usually financially worse off than you is always going to be the victim. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=237.92s)]
*  Therefore, their victims no longer get justice for their suffering because we've switched [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=242.32s)]
*  it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=248.2s)]
*  I don't believe that the Dems actually ever cared about this guy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  They don't really care about the victims at all. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  What they care about is themselves and how to score virtue signaling points and political [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=254.76s)]
*  points. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=259.92s)]
*  Who is the real victim? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=261.12s)]
*  They don't care unless it's them, unless they get mugged, unless they get carjacked. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=262.52s)]
*  That was some traffic stop, Martha. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it tells you something that the Tennessee Highway Patrol decided, you know what, that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  video that we have in the back, I think we better release it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=275.2s)]
*  I think we better see people, let people see what was going on here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  You got to be careful who you make your hero, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  Because you have to stand behind that story. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  Think about Jocelyn Nungery. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  Think about Lake and Riley. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  No, you know, the deeper you dug into the story, the more tragic and horrible it became [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  and the more victim, you know, the more sensitive we all were to their victimhood. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=298.12s)]
*  This guy, the Maryland man, is an El Salvadoran. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=304.12s)]
*  He's now currently in his home country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  He is back home. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  And what else we know is exactly what his wife said. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=312.56s)]
*  On that tape, she sounds very credible. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=315.58s)]
*  I mean, Justice, Judge Janine has listened to a lot of women tell their story, and I [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=318.64s)]
*  bet it sounds very familiar to her. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=324.24s)]
*  And now I feel, you know, it is sad that she has to lean on ICE because now she's gone [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=327.0s)]
*  so far down with this story of her innocent husband that she has to find some way to make [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=332.72s)]
*  it better. But it is not ICE who woke up and punched you in the face in the middle of the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=337.92s)]
*  night. And it was not COVID that pulled your hair and almost pushed you down the stairs. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=342.76s)]
*  And it is it's sad. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=348.44s)]
*  But you really have to if you're going to make someone your hero, you better kick the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  tires on their story first. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=352.92s)]
*  They're still demanding, Judge, that this person come back to the United States even [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=354.8s)]
*  after this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=360.8s)]
*  You know, Jesse, I can't I can't think for them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=363.0s)]
*  I think that the hate is so deep within them for anything that the Trump administration [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=366.76s)]
*  does that they prefer to be on the side of the criminal. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=373.48s)]
*  But I've spent 30 years watching a society that takes the side of the criminal and then [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=376.6s)]
*  turns the victim into the bad person. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=383.32s)]
*  Look, I'm not an ideologue when it comes to this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=385.6s)]
*  I'm an experienced law enforcement professional. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=388.0s)]
*  I started the first domestic violence unit in the country. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=391.2s)]
*  I know what happens with battered women. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=394.64s)]
*  Any man who is willing to beat a woman in front of another person, whether it is a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=397.2s)]
*  neighbor or a sister, will continue to beat that woman. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=403.12s)]
*  That beating will increase in intensity and frequency as time goes on. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  And when she doesn't go forward with the charges and then minimizes it as she does [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=412.56s)]
*  here, then he is more confident that he can get away with anything. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=417.04s)]
*  So we have a very dangerous man there. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=421.64s)]
*  He's not just a wife beater. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=424.12s)]
*  He is a man who is convinced he is above the law. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=425.72s)]
*  But on top of that, he was arrested in 2019. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=428.72s)]
*  No one talks about this for loitering. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=432.08s)]
*  He was stopped in 2022 for human trafficking. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=434.32s)]
*  OK, and they called ICE. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=437.56s)]
*  But under the Biden administration, ICE never showed up. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=439.24s)]
*  What a shock. And on top of that, he had and I had a gang unit. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=442.48s)]
*  I had one of the few gang units in New York state. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=446.72s)]
*  I had the gang investigators. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=449.36s)]
*  He has all the tats for MS-13, whether it's marijuana, the skull, the smiley face [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=451.16s)]
*  or the cross. It's he is MS-13. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=456.76000000000005s)]
*  All right. This guy, the only reason there was a hold on him is because he said he is [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=459.92s)]
*  afraid of the other gang in El Salvador that they'll kill him. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=466.12s)]
*  Why did they want to kill him? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  Because he's an MS-13 gang banger. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=471.92s)]
*  I mean, Ray Zipson, Sue Esponti, whatever you want to say, if you're a lawyer, this [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=474.4s)]
*  guy is a dirt bag. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=479.92s)]
*  And if you take his side, you know, if you lie in the grass with dogs, you come up with [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=481.4s)]
*  fleas. And that's where the Democrats are. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=485.88s)]
*  This guy who's obviously MS-13, Harold, he is a very good lawyer and he's had very good [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=488.12s)]
*  lawyers over the last couple of years. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=494.0s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  It is. It's good to be back with you guys. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=497.76s)]
*  Been a long week. I'd say a couple of things. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=499.56s)]
*  First, sentimentally, I am with the president on this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm with those around the table. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=505.96000000000004s)]
*  I reject this Democrat-Republican thing because I'm a Democrat and I've got hundreds, if [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=507.16s)]
*  not thousands of Democrat friends who share your opinion that we shouldn't be defending [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=511.20000000000005s)]
*  people who hurt people, particularly people who hit women. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=517.2s)]
*  For the life of me, what I can't quite get my arms around and we can come back to it is [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=520.84s)]
*  why all of this wasn't presented before the judges that looked at all of this, because [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=524.28s)]
*  you've said it very well, Jesse, over the period of a few weeks as the judge has. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=529.6s)]
*  You would think with all of this evidence that they would have allowed for him to be [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=534.28s)]
*  shipped down there, we would not be talking about due process or these rights for him. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=537.36s)]
*  So something is not completely adding up for me. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=540.76s)]
*  Three, the Democrat-Republican thing, I remind everybody, I don't credit people who are [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=544.04s)]
*  different political party than I who may do things. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=552.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think that the Republican Party is a racist party because David Duke, who's [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=554.32s)]
*  an unrepentant head of the Ku Klux Klan, ran as a Republican and was nominated as [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=557.88s)]
*  Republican. I don't think all Republicans are bad or racist. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=561.64s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I don't even think Republicans are racist. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=564.2800000000001s)]
*  I think some people are who happen to be Republican. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=566.48s)]
*  Timothy McVeigh was a bad guy. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=568.88s)]
*  He aligned more with the Republican Party than the Democrat Party. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=570.52s)]
*  I know you're not. I just think we should be careful not to cast a party as being in [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=573.24s)]
*  favor of gang bangers, people who beat women and hit women and people who violate the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=577.72s)]
*  laws of our country. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  Finally, the court is ultimately going to decide and the judge and I, we probably agree [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=586.04s)]
*  on this and maybe we all agree, the court is ultimately going to decide one question. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  Do non-citizens have due process rights like citizens have? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  In the past, we've said that non-citizens have due process rights. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=600.48s)]
*  I can think of citizens who should not have due process rights, who I find completely [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=604.16s)]
*  offensive. There was a guy three blocks from here who shot a guy five in the morning named [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  Louis Mangione, whose due process rights are being respected. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=612.96s)]
*  And he has great lawyers. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=618.12s)]
*  He wanted he's trying to get part of his charges dropped today. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=619.84s)]
*  But that's just how our system works. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=623.32s)]
*  We give people these rights and ultimately, ultimately the court is going to decide do [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=625.2s)]
*  non-citizens because this guy was not a citizen, do non-citizens or people applying for [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=629.88s)]
*  citizenship. What access to due process do they have? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=634.44s)]
*  You may not like that argument, but that's the American system. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=637.72s)]
*  But sentimentally, I'm with everybody around the table. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=640.32s)]
*  I am not for a man who hits women. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=642.48s)]
*  I am not for a man who violates our immigration laws. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=644.48s)]
*  And I'm certainly not for someone to terrorize the children in MS-13. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=647.28s)]
*  Barack Obama deported three million illegals. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=650.48s)]
*  Eighty seven percent of them didn't have a hearing. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=654.6s)]
*  So all of a sudden, when it's Donald Trump, let's get some new rights out there. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=658.0s)]
*  But wait a second, the judge who just in Texas, a judge who said that you can't use the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=662.36s)]
*  Alien Enemies Act to do this, that was a Trump appointee. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=666.4s)]
*  Now, I normally don't care. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=669.0s)]
*  But that's another local judge trying to impact the nation. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=670.32s)]
*  He's a federal judge. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=672.84s)]
*  He's a local federal judge. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=673.6400000000001s)]
*  He's a district court versus a circuit court versus a Supreme Court. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  But some around the table will say that's a Democratic judge. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=679.5200000000001s)]
*  This was a judge appointed by President Trump. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=681.5200000000001s)]
*  Nobody's saying that. We're saying he doesn't have jurisdiction to decide that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  That's the day. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=686.48s)]
*  They're going to keep arguing for the next 10 minutes in the commercial. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=687.0s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=689.7600000000001s)]
*  We will. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WV2E0_bFhk&t=690.2s)]
