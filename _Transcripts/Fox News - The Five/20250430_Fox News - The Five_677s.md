# Watters rips into Garcia's 'security risk': 'FOLLOW THE LAW'
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k)
*  President Trump sparring with ABC News anchor Terry Moran on his best issue with voters, deportations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=0.0s)]
*  Things getting pretty heated over the ongoing case of alleged of his 13-gang member, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=5.8s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. Watch it here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=10.44s)]
*  You could get him back. There's a phone on this desk. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=13.14s)]
*  I could. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=15.44s)]
*  But the court has ordered you to facilitate that release. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=15.94s)]
*  I'm not the one making this decision. We have lawyers that don't want... [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=18.94s)]
*  He had MS-13 on his knuckles. Tattoo. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=22.44s)]
*  Oh, he had some tattoos that are interpreted that way. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=25.14s)]
*  It says MS-13. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=27.14s)]
*  Yeah, that was Photoshopped. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=28.94s)]
*  You want me to show you the picture? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=29.94s)]
*  I'm not an expert. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=31.44s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia is not the only immigration story the press is focused on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=33.44s)]
*  There are many, but Charlamagne the God blasting the media and accusing them of misleading the public [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=36.94s)]
*  over a report that the Trump administration is deporting children with cancer. Watch. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=42.44s)]
*  I do think when the media has that conversation, we can't rage bait though. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=47.94s)]
*  Because, you know, every time they say it, they'll be like, oh, a two-year-old got deported, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=51.44s)]
*  a three-year-old got deported, but they're not telling the whole story of their parent was here illegally [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=53.94s)]
*  and so the parent got deported and so they sent the child with them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=58.44s)]
*  Because when I hear it, I'm like, why the hell would they deport a two-year-old? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=61.44s)]
*  Why would they deport some child with cancer? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=64.44s)]
*  All right. Hey, Greg, just before we get your comments, this little gem came in from a congressman from Georgia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=68.44s)]
*  His name is Hank Johnson. Watch. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=74.94s)]
*  First, they came for the Latinos outside of the Home Depots. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=77.94s)]
*  And I didn't say anything about it because I'm not a Latino at the Home Depot. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=87.44s)]
*  Then they came for the Hispanic-looking folks wearing hats backward with tattoos. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=95.44s)]
*  I didn't say anything about that because I don't wear my hair backward and I don't have any tattoos and I don't look like a Latino. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=104.44s)]
*  All right, Greg. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=115.94s)]
*  Then they came for this stupid congressman. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=117.94s)]
*  I was just thinking, I wish I was sitting next to you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=121.94s)]
*  That would be so much better with bongos, Dana. We need to put bongos under that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=123.94s)]
*  Give me your thoughts. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=127.94s)]
*  Well, let's simplify it. The letters and the numbers are labels that translate the symbols on his knuckles. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=128.94s)]
*  The reporter tried to say that the labels were the tattoo, an intentional deception to make you think he's a gang member. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=138.44s)]
*  No, we know he's a gang member. Those numbers above aren't even the same typeface. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=146.44s)]
*  Let me put it this way. Can you put us back in boxes for now? All of us in boxes? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=153.44s)]
*  Okay, people at home, we're not really in boxes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=159.44s)]
*  It's just a production thing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=163.44s)]
*  That label was added on as a translated. What the newscaster tried to do was make it sound like, oh my God, the whole thing was doctored. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=165.94s)]
*  No, it wasn't. But the real joke is that we are talking about the nature of the tattoo when we already know the nature of the thug. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=175.94s)]
*  And because we know that he is a gang member, that he has a violent history, that there are police reports and there are court proceedings that cover this whole thing, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=187.44s)]
*  we now have to shift this over onto, wow, it's photoshopped. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=197.44s)]
*  No. Do you honestly think the mafia walks around with Gambino crime family tattooed on their chest? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=202.44s)]
*  How stupid are you? But the Democrats and the media have made them into their latest martyr. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=210.44s)]
*  They never do the victims. They only do the victimizer. Whether it's a criminal, a human trafficker, a guy trying to play women's sports, doesn't matter. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=216.94s)]
*  They always pick the wrong guy. In this case, this guy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=224.94s)]
*  And Judge He is from Georgia, and so is Lake and Riley. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=227.94s)]
*  Yeah. I didn't hear him worried about her, which I think is probably the basis of your question. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=232.94s)]
*  But if you will just indulge me, I have to do this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=238.44s)]
*  I am sick and tired of the issue of whether or not Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang banger. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=242.44s)]
*  I had a gang unit as a prosecutor. It was one of the first in New York State. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=249.44s)]
*  I had gang interpreters, gang investigators, and you identify a gang member by the colors or the tats. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=254.44s)]
*  And the gang interpreters have made it very clear that the marijuana on his finger is for M. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=262.94s)]
*  And the S on his finger is not S, it's smiley face, is for the S. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=270.94s)]
*  And the plus sign is equal to 1, and the skeleton is equal to 3. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=278.94s)]
*  That's what a gang interpreter would tell you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=283.94s)]
*  The weed, the smile, the plus, and the skeleton means you're MS-13. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=286.44s)]
*  End of the story. Okay? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=293.44s)]
*  Now, number two. The guy comes here not as an illegal through the regular ports, he comes in as a gotaway. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=295.44s)]
*  He didn't want anyone to know he was coming in. He gets here, he beats his wife not once, but twice. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=302.44s)]
*  Two words of protection. Beats the hell out of her. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=308.44s)]
*  Now we find out that there is a court document where the father of those two children, the mother of whom he was living with, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=311.94s)]
*  goes to court and he wants to get his kids back because his wife is living with a gang banger. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=319.94s)]
*  Okay? And the time is very consistent with the time that she was living with Abrego Garcia. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=325.94s)]
*  Now, we had two hearings. Two judges said he's a gang banger. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=331.94s)]
*  And the only reason that there was a hold put on the deportation order twice the deportation order was issued [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=336.44s)]
*  is because he was fearful of a rival gang in El Salvador that would kill him. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=343.44s)]
*  Okay? So I gotta tell you, I don't know how much evidence you need, but this guy is an MS-13 gang banger. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=349.44s)]
*  And let me just finalize it with this. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=356.44s)]
*  Obama deported three million people, 83% of which never got a hearing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=358.94s)]
*  No one ever complained about a hearing. No one said they needed due process. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=364.94s)]
*  No one even said they needed to call a lawyer. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=369.44s)]
*  This is bizarre. And if you buy into it, you're crazy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=372.44s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=377.94s)]
*  Jessica, earlier today, Hakeem Jeffries, the House leader of the Democrats, said he doesn't want people going down to El Salvador anymore. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=378.94s)]
*  He didn't say not for vacation, but not to go and do this kind of stunt anymore. They must have numbers that show it's not working. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=386.44s)]
*  Well, we know that people's feelings about the economy are what decide elections. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=393.44s)]
*  And he wants to be talking about cuts to Medicaid and cuts to Social Security. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=397.44s)]
*  And that's a real debate that's going on within the party. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=401.94s)]
*  But it is also clear that Van Hollen going down to El Salvador did move public opinion on this issue. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=404.44s)]
*  By two to one margin, people think that Abrego Garcia should be returned to the United States. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=411.94s)]
*  And the reason that people are talking about that exchange last night with Trump and Terry Moran about the tattoos is that we were all assured that no one was dumb enough to think that it was actually said MS-13. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=416.94s)]
*  But it seemed like Trump actually did think that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=429.94s)]
*  And there have been a number of experts on gang tattoos, like CBS, I'm looking at an article right now that they spoke to, who said that these experts did not say that the symbols the judge talked about, the marijuana leaf and the cross and the smiley... [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=432.44s)]
*  Then they're wrong. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=444.44s)]
*  Okay, our gang expert is better than these. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=445.44s)]
*  I prosecuted these cases. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=447.44s)]
*  Okay, that's fine. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=448.44s)]
*  Either way, public opinion has shifted on this issue. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=450.44s)]
*  In terms of the kids, the problem with those cases are that those mothers did not get to talk to their lawyers. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=454.94s)]
*  One of them who had the two-year-old, this is not the four-year-old who had cancer, who was supported with the two-year-old, had two minutes on the phone to talk to her husband to try to figure out what would happen to her American child. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=462.94s)]
*  And so yes, like any mother, they said, I will take my kid with me rather than leave them in a system where I don't know what's going to happen to them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=472.94s)]
*  I think we can all agree that you should be able to talk to your lawyer before you are deported, especially with your American citizen child. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=480.44s)]
*  The New York Times has a really interesting deep dive piece out today on the El Salvadorian president, Bukele, and the prison. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=488.44s)]
*  And what it exposes is that actually he was uncomfortable with the arrangement once he figured out that Donald Trump was sending people to his prison who had not been convicted of any crime. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=496.44s)]
*  We know as well that there is reporting that up to 75% of the people that have been sent there have not been convicted of a crime. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=507.94s)]
*  So think about this. The guy who refers to himself as the world's coolest dictator, he is uncomfortable with what we are doing to people. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=512.94s)]
*  This isn't about deportations. This is about sending people to a foreign prison camp without getting a hearing and without being convicted of anything. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=521.94s)]
*  And that's why Americans' public opinion on the immigration policy has shifted. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=529.94s)]
*  The conviction is not the requirement. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=535.44s)]
*  Let me correct something that I said. Because Hakeem Jeffries apparently denies that he doesn't want people going to El Salvador. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=537.44s)]
*  So maybe Jesse thinks it's a good idea. I don't know. But his office denies this report that he said don't go down to El Salvador anymore. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=544.44s)]
*  Just for the record, Jesse finally brought it to you. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=551.44s)]
*  No one else is going because it's stupid. And I'm sorry, Jessica, I love you, but I don't believe anything you say anymore. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=553.44s)]
*  You're wrong about everything. Every time you come up with these things. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=559.44s)]
*  First he's a Maryland dad that actually does have tattoos that spell MS-13. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=563.94s)]
*  And then there's this other tattoo expert that you have. I thought we were supposed to trust the experts, right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=567.94s)]
*  And all these experts say this guy's a gangbanger and you don't trust the experts. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=574.94s)]
*  Let me ask you this. When a guy hangs out with MS-13 and gets picked up in a gang sweep, how is it that the MS-13 ranking gang members are allowing a non-gang member to hang out with them? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=578.94s)]
*  Don't you think that's a little bit of a security risk, Jessica? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=592.44s)]
*  That's like when the feds raid a Gambino gambling den. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=595.44s)]
*  And do you think it would be believable if some Italian guy was like, I'm not in the mob? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=600.44s)]
*  Yeah, they're just letting random guys play cards in a gambling den with a bunch of mafioso. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=605.44s)]
*  Use your brain, Jessica. And I don't even believe you're this two-year-old nonsense. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=611.44s)]
*  Oh, you just listen to what the lawyers for these migrants tell you. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=616.44s)]
*  And then the day later, it's all wrong. You know what the protocol is? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=620.94s)]
*  When you pick up an illegal, you don't know this. I'll tell you this for the first time. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=624.94s)]
*  When you pick up an illegal and they happen to have their kid with them, they get a choice. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=629.94s)]
*  Do you want to be deported with your child? Or you can assign a family member or a guardian here in the United States to leave the child there. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=634.94s)]
*  That's the choice. And if you don't like the law, then go to Congress, change the law. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=643.94s)]
*  Because otherwise you just get women here, coming here, breaking through the border, having babies, and they all get to stay because you feel bad. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=649.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. You can feel bad about a lot of things, but I'd rather follow the law. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxUVvP-L3k&t=656.44s)]
