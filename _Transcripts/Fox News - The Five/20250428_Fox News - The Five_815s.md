# ‘The Five’: Trump rings in 100 days of ‘fun’ work in the Oval Office
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8)
*  President Trump kicking off 100 days in office this week with a media blitz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=0.0s)]
*  And it sounds like he's feeling very good in this new interview. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=4.4s)]
*  Take a listen here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=7.92s)]
*  One of the things that a couple of your advisors have told us is that you're having a lot of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=8.92s)]
*  fun this time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=14.4s)]
*  I am. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=15.4s)]
*  That there's just... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=16.4s)]
*  I'm having a lot of fun considering what I do. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  You know, what I do is serious stuff. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=19.44s)]
*  Serious stuff indeed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=22.0s)]
*  The president marking his 100-day milestone with a huge focus on immigration with stunning [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=23.0s)]
*  raids in two separate states, one at a migrant nightclub, resulting in the arrest of hundreds [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=28.16s)]
*  of illegal immigrants. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  And the White House, well, they were up early today lining the lawn with posters displaying [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=34.0s)]
*  alleged illegal immigrants' mugshots and crimes they committed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=38.34s)]
*  They also held a rare early morning briefing with the border czar, Tom Homan. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=41.9s)]
*  This is unprecedented success. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  The border's secure. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=50.94s)]
*  President Trump's saving lives. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=53.1s)]
*  President Trump has proven no one does it better. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=55.36s)]
*  Than President Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=57.68s)]
*  There is no equal. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=59.52s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  This is a border emergency until we end it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  End all of it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=63.9s)]
*  You can argue against us all you want and protest all you want. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=64.9s)]
*  But when you cross that line, I've said this a thousand times, when you cross that line [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=67.48s)]
*  to impede me or knowingly harbour and concealing an illegal alien mice, you will be prosecuted. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=71.8s)]
*  Judge or not. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=78.88s)]
*  And so much for nobody is above the law. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=80.44s)]
*  The media sure seems to have forgotten its favorite slogan from the days of Trump's legal [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  problems after the arrest of a Milwaukee judge accused of helping an illegal immigrant [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=86.96s)]
*  in her courtroom escape ICE agents. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  This is all a clown show. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=94.8s)]
*  He wants to be king. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=95.8s)]
*  A king doesn't have a constitution. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=96.8s)]
*  A king just does whatever he wants. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=98.8s)]
*  This is a constitutional crisis. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=100.55999999999999s)]
*  It strikes me as maybe something illegal, but it also strikes me as something heroic. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=102.55999999999999s)]
*  People are sometimes called to do civil disobedience. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  Arresting a judge today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=110.28s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=111.28s)]
*  That is a sign of weakness, not strength. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=113.96s)]
*  Judge, I thought the whispering was over. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=117.16s)]
*  That was Biden. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Rachel Maddow got in on that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  100 days is a time for a little reflection in the White House saying here are the wins [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=121.56s)]
*  that we have so far. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=126.0s)]
*  You know, there's so much to talk about here and I'll be as quick as possible. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=127.0s)]
*  Look, 100 days have been a remarkable success and I'm not going to go through all of them, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=130.16s)]
*  but I think the most important thing is immigration and what's happening and the American people [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=134.88s)]
*  agree. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=139.96s)]
*  Fifty five percent are agreeing that what the president is doing on immigration is incredible [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=140.96s)]
*  and the transparency of this administration and the actual, you know, Trump's speed with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=145.72s)]
*  which they're working is unbelievable. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  It's like we have two press conferences every day. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=153.55999999999997s)]
*  It's like you feel you're actually working in the Oval Office. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=156.11999999999998s)]
*  But let's talk about those hundred people who are arrested. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=159.0s)]
*  During the Biden administration, 170 911 calls, emergency calls, and nothing was done about [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=162.56s)]
*  this club. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  These TDA gang bangers and everyone else are doing drugs, selling drugs, you know, selling [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=171.52s)]
*  guns, doing all kinds of illegal stuff, prostitution, you name it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=176.4s)]
*  Or it's an organized criminal enterprise. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  So kudos to Van Bondy for getting involved in there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=182.0s)]
*  And now, now what the president does and his administration is takes a picture of every [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=186.28s)]
*  one of them, puts them outside the White House with their photo and what crime they're charged [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=191.68s)]
*  with. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  Because punishment is not enough in these cases. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=199.88s)]
*  They have to be socially ostracized. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  And that's what we did in the public square when we were a young country. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=206.0s)]
*  Everyone knew what was going on and who was charged with what. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=210.5s)]
*  So as far as I'm concerned, those individuals who want to blur their faces on the left, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  they say we should blur them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=220.64s)]
*  Why do they have privacy rights? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=221.64s)]
*  Are they even citizens here? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  So but let's move on to the judge. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=225.76s)]
*  This judge should be removed from the bench. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=228.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=231.08s)]
*  No one knows better what she was doing than she herself. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=232.08s)]
*  She made it clear in terms of her actions and in her words, her intent and in what she [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=235.72s)]
*  did. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=240.64s)]
*  What's even more egregious here with this judge is that this defendant who was in a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=241.64s)]
*  courthouse, which is the essence of accountability, and for her it's an escape. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=246.16s)]
*  But what she did was this guy was in court for a trial on a domestic violence case, two [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=251.36s)]
*  witnesses and victims were in the courtroom with the prosecution about to go forward. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=256.92s)]
*  And this judge decides that she's going to move on to the courthouse, tells ICE you go [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=262.6s)]
*  see the other judge, the chief administrative judge, to get them out of the way and creates [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=267.36s)]
*  a danger in the public so that there could be a shootout and other people could be harmed [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=272.2s)]
*  as well. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=278.24s)]
*  But let me finally say that I want to know everything about this judge. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=279.24s)]
*  With this judge went so far as to try to get an illegal on trial for domestic violence [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=284.36s)]
*  out of the courthouse so that he not be held accountable. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=291.0s)]
*  I want to know how many of these cases have been dismissed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=294.16s)]
*  I want to know how many victims have had a case go forward where their rights were protected. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=297.2s)]
*  What the prosecutors have to say about this judge, because it's not enough for her to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=302.6s)]
*  just be charged with this crime. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, she may have judicial immunity, but only for judicial acts. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=309.36s)]
*  This is not a judicial act. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=313.68s)]
*  Those questions cross my mind, too. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=314.88s)]
*  In the kickoff to the first one, yeah, the first 100 days, the administration led with [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  their strong foot, which is the border security and immigration. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=323.04s)]
*  Good idea? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=327.32000000000005s)]
*  I suppose so. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  But first of all, the first 100 days is a media creation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=329.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  It's just designed as a hook for producers to come up with an angle in the summer. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  Because what else are we going to do right now? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  There's nothing really going on. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  The criticism, though, about Trump's 100 days is marred by one thing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=341.48s)]
*  They claim Republicans are critical. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=347.2s)]
*  They're not. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=349.36s)]
*  They love what they see. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=350.36s)]
*  They just want more. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=351.36s)]
*  And then when you look at the Democrats' criticism, you have to ask a follow-up question. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=352.36s)]
*  What is it that's bothering you? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=357.0s)]
*  They don't have an answer, because they actually have no solutions. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=359.44s)]
*  It's always these platitudes like Chuck Schumer. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=362.32s)]
*  It's a constitutional crisis. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  What does that really mean? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=367.12s)]
*  Can you point to anything? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=368.4s)]
*  But it is only 100 days, and yet it feels like 1,000. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=369.84s)]
*  It's because Trump does easily 10 times what any previous president does. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=375.32s)]
*  It's like you went from a dial-up modem to 5G. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=379.52s)]
*  It's like I don't have to sit in front of my laptop and wait for something to happen. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  He says it, and it happens. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=387.2s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=389.2s)]
*  He basically pointed to the, what do you call it, to the stands, the bleachers, and said, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to hit a home run. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  And he did that on illegal immigration. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=397.76s)]
*  He didn't just end it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=399.76s)]
*  He flattened it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  And by doing that, he exposed that the Democrats had been lying all the time when they were [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  saying their hands were tied. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=406.44s)]
*  Well, it looks like their hands had blood on them because they let a lot of criminals [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=407.76s)]
*  in that killed people. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=411.48s)]
*  He also crushed the structural racism of DEI. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=412.64s)]
*  He fulfilled his promise to get women out of sports, and that was quick. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=415.96s)]
*  And now you have imposters like Slotkin going, well, it really wasn't an important issue [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=420.2s)]
*  at all. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=423.48s)]
*  Well, if it wasn't that important, why were you so cowardly in not actually defending [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=424.48s)]
*  the women and the girls who are subject to that travesty? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=428.04s)]
*  The only thing that's kind of out there, there's a couple of things. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=431.56s)]
*  Tariffs. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=435.76000000000005s)]
*  You can't judge that in 100 days. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=436.76000000000005s)]
*  But as predicted, the people that were screaming about the massive drop in the stock market [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  are not saying a word about it returning to normal or near normal. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=442.72s)]
*  And we also have to think about Doge. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=448.04s)]
*  Are we even close to the goal necessary to prevent economic collapse? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=449.92s)]
*  No. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  And everything we just talked about is pointless unless we solve that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=455.5s)]
*  OK, and Jesse, let me go to you next. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=459.5s)]
*  We'll save Harold for last so that he can, you know. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=462.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=467.46s)]
*  Well, I figured we were just on a roll. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=468.46s)]
*  Sure, let's keep it going. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=471.02s)]
*  Can you keep the roll going? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=472.02s)]
*  I just love that Trump put these signs on the lawn. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=473.02s)]
*  Only a president who watches cable news all day could come up with a stunt like that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=477.38s)]
*  He's like, you know what? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=482.06s)]
*  You wanted to see my mug shot? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=483.72s)]
*  Well, here's Jose's mug shot and he's going home, adios. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=485.78s)]
*  This is in the back of every single live shot all day long and they can't do anything about [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=489.78s)]
*  it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=494.14s)]
*  But they did it at MSNBC, Dana. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=495.14s)]
*  They pixelated the faces. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=496.21999999999997s)]
*  Now we have a thing in cable television, you only blur faces of minors. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=498.3s)]
*  They're blurring the faces of people convicted of raping minors. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=503.41999999999996s)]
*  And why are they coddling these people? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=507.74s)]
*  Dana, as you know, there was a school of thought. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=509.5s)]
*  During the time of, I believe, European imperialism, it is known as the noble savages. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=513.02s)]
*  Now, the Western elites believe that these indigenous people were almost more morally [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=520.02s)]
*  superior to the West because they were in harmony with nature. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=527.9399999999999s)]
*  They were pure. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=533.26s)]
*  They were uncorrupted by the materialism of modern society. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=534.26s)]
*  So they were put on a pedestal and they were not allowed to be characterized as evil in [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=539.08s)]
*  any way. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=545.22s)]
*  And this is what the modern left is doing with these people. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  They are coddling them and protecting them. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  And even if they do something bad, it's blurred out, it's ignored because you have to keep [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=553.6s)]
*  that the same way. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=559.2s)]
*  The judges are doing it too. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=560.84s)]
*  They're making planes turn around. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=562.44s)]
*  They're keeping these guys in their homes, MS-13. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=564.82s)]
*  And now they're aiding and abetting the escape. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=567.96s)]
*  They have sworn to administer justice and then they're letting these people escape justice [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=569.84s)]
*  by putting themselves and the criminal above the law. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=575.36s)]
*  And if Trump tries to execute the law, he's not allowed to do that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=579.76s)]
*  I have a law in my family. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=584.6800000000001s)]
*  The children are not allowed to sleep or sit or touch the floor of an airport. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  We're at the airport today. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=593.36s)]
*  What does Jesse Jr. do? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=594.88s)]
*  The kid sits. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  He knows I can't stand that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=598.16s)]
*  I say, Jesse, you can't sit on the floor of the airport. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=599.68s)]
*  He goes, okay. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=602.0s)]
*  Know what he does? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=603.0s)]
*  He squats. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=604.0s)]
*  He did that on purpose. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=605.0s)]
*  And I pick him up. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=607.1199999999999s)]
*  And then you know what he does? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=608.1199999999999s)]
*  He steals his sister's bag, sits on the bag. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=609.1199999999999s)]
*  That's violating the spirit of the law in my family. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  So I grab him, I pull it up like that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=615.56s)]
*  Now I'm allowed to administer justice. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm allowed to execute the law of the land. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=621.92s)]
*  It's my family. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  And if someone was to come in and say, your son's allowed to sit on the floor or you're [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=625.72s)]
*  not allowed to pull yourself up from the airport floor, that would be dangerous. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  Because if you allow that, you have chaos. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=635.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=638.64s)]
*  Keep it rolling, Harold. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=639.64s)]
*  Yeah, Harold, I'm going to know if you can keep it rolling after that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=640.64s)]
*  I'm taking notes on airport rules for my kids. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=643.72s)]
*  I think those are good rules. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=646.48s)]
*  It's a good rule. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=647.48s)]
*  Good to be back with everybody. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=648.48s)]
*  I'll tell you a couple of things. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=649.48s)]
*  FDR was the first person to talk about the first 100 days because the country was in [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=650.48s)]
*  economic disrepair and the country wanted to know what happened the first 100 days. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=654.56s)]
*  The polling we see today, there's some good things for the president. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=660.3599999999999s)]
*  You mentioned some of the DEI stuff, some of the gender stuff, and obviously some of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=663.64s)]
*  the immigration and really the border. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  The president's numbers are mid-50s. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=669.52s)]
*  I'm part of the mid-50s. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=671.0s)]
*  It would sound like what the president's doing on the border. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=672.0s)]
*  We cut down on people crossing it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=674.64s)]
*  I'd probably be with the mixed group. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=676.3599999999999s)]
*  It was about 48, 48, depending on which poll who looked at how the president was doing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=678.2399999999999s)]
*  on immigration. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=681.8s)]
*  I have a different opinion about the judge. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=682.8399999999999s)]
*  I think the judge in the case in Milwaukee and the ICE agents were wrong. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=684.64s)]
*  I don't think you correct that wrong by arresting her. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=689.0s)]
*  They got that guy. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=690.92s)]
*  They want it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=691.92s)]
*  And I think you, the chief justice there should, let me just finish. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=692.92s)]
*  I think the chief judge should say that you shouldn't, if we're harboring anybody, we [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=695.16s)]
*  shouldn't be doing that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=698.5999999999999s)]
*  Three, as much as the president was good on the border, we shouldn't kid ourselves and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=700.0s)]
*  no one around the table should. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=704.5999999999999s)]
*  The reason the president was elected was the border and the economy. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=706.04s)]
*  We talked about inflation and the high prices. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=709.46s)]
*  Dana has said this before. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=712.86s)]
*  It's the next hundred days that are most important. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=714.1800000000001s)]
*  But if the president, if president Trump's numbers were high on the economy, then the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  president wouldn't be upside down on his approval ratings. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=721.14s)]
*  He has the lowest approval in a hundred days, first hundred days since they've done polling, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=723.38s)]
*  which was since 1945. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=727.74s)]
*  And that's because the economy and how people are feeling about their economic futures are [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=729.5s)]
*  down. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=733.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, I'm consistent on this. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=734.5400000000001s)]
*  When President Biden and his team were telling the American people that they were doing better [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=735.5400000000001s)]
*  than the numbers suggested, I came on this show and others and said, there are a long [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=740.18s)]
*  line of politicians who are sitting at home today because they tried to tell people you're [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=744.5s)]
*  doing better than you think you are. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=748.54s)]
*  Seventy percent of those polled believe that we are at or near a recession. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=751.06s)]
*  A little more than that number believes that we're not doing right on tariffs, whatever [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=754.54s)]
*  anyone around the table wants to say about tariffs. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=758.14s)]
*  And about that same number don't like all of the cuts in government. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=760.5799999999999s)]
*  They like the idea and they believe that we can shrink and get out the redundancies and [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=764.2199999999999s)]
*  the fraud and abuse, but they think we can be doing it a little bit better. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=769.9s)]
*  But I end on this. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=773.62s)]
*  Democrats shouldn't show too much glee here. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=775.0999999999999s)]
*  We have to offer ideas ourselves. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=776.8599999999999s)]
*  The first 100 days, the president did not end the war in Ukraine, like he said, in 24 [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfxAYLCya8&t=779.14s)]
