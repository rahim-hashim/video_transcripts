# ‘ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM’: Watters asks why Dems can’t just help us out
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA)
*  President Trump is putting the pressure on China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=0.0s)]
*  The commander-in-chief hitting the communist nation with a 145% tariff [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=3.0s)]
*  while announcing a 90-day pause on the other nations [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=9.8s)]
*  so we can negotiate those tailor-made deals. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  47 meeting with his cabinet as they strategize their next moves. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=16.8s)]
*  Everybody wants to come and make a deal. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=22.2s)]
*  I'm not sure we could ever have enough time in the day [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  to talk to all these countries because they want to talk [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=26.96s)]
*  and they want to talk now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=28.84s)]
*  And they have come with offers that they never, ever, ever would have come with. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=30.16s)]
*  Well, we'll see what happens with China. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  We would love to be able to work a deal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=38.32s)]
*  I think that we'll end up working out something that's very good for both countries. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=41.800000000000004s)]
*  After the market shot up like a rocket yesterday thanks to that 90-day pause, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=47.92s)]
*  here come the Russiagate losers like Adam Schiff [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=53.44s)]
*  to baselessly claim that there was an insider trading conspiracy afoot. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=56.96s)]
*  Who knew in advance that the president was going to once again flip-flop on tariffs? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=62.68s)]
*  And are people cashing in? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=67.48s)]
*  This administration is replete with grifters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=68.8s)]
*  I hope there will be a searching, penetrating investigation [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=72.36s)]
*  into the potential for manipulation and insider trading. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=76.04s)]
*  Outright market manipulation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=80.64s)]
*  The possible stock manipulation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=82.56s)]
*  What if any advanced knowledge did members of the House Republican Conference have? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=84.68s)]
*  The corruption is just completely out in the open. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=91.32s)]
*  If someone with knowledge of an economic policy change [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=93.6s)]
*  that would cause the markets to shoot back up [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=97.0s)]
*  right before posting about how great a time it is to buy [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=100.24s)]
*  right before the policy change happened [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=103.12s)]
*  would certainly be guilty of insider trading. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=106.16s)]
*  But Democrats can't quite figure out if it's insider trading [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=110.08s)]
*  or caving to China. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=114.24s)]
*  This was not the plan. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=116.64s)]
*  This was, he had to cave because of these external pressures. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  The plan was made up that day. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  It was not, nobody on Wall Street, they didn't run it by Wall Street. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=124.36s)]
*  They didn't run it by business leaders and CEOs. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  He blinked, as he should have, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=131.24s)]
*  because he was about to destroy the American economy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=133.16s)]
*  The president won't cave. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  He's got a spine of steel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=137.24s)]
*  Turn out the spine of steel was no match for the brain of mashed potatoes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=139.4s)]
*  OK, Jesse, they say it's stock manipulation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=145.2s)]
*  But how's it stock manipulation when Trump says at 9.17 in the morning, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=150.11999999999998s)]
*  you know, everybody buy, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  and it isn't until four hours later that he takes the pause? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Nancy got filthy rich, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  and now they want to look at stock manipulation? Come on. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=162.32s)]
*  The Democrats are mad when the market goes down, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  and then they're mad when the market goes up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=167.6s)]
*  You just can't win with these people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  Is he caving to China? Is he too tough on China? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=172.8s)]
*  I wish the Democrats would just help us out for once. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  This is about economic patriotism. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  This is about national security. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=183.52s)]
*  And the Democrats have to just criticise everything this guy does. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=185.8s)]
*  Oh, he blinked. Wait a second. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  I thought you wanted him to lower tariffs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=193.36s)]
*  Now you're going to investigate him for lowering tariffs? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=195.44s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=198.72s)]
*  They say that this is going too quickly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=200.64s)]
*  So if you do it the way they want to do it, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=204.12s)]
*  maybe you go 5% tariff, 10% tariff, 15% tariff, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=206.4s)]
*  and it just never gets anywhere. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  And our allies never race to negotiate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  And then that's an actual trade war. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=215.0s)]
*  They'll just sit back and they'll raise their tariffs, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=217.04s)]
*  and then we get nothing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=219.2s)]
*  Trump has to do this fast. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=220.84s)]
*  He's up against the midterms. He's term-limited. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=222.92s)]
*  We think he's term-limited. He is. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=225.64s)]
*  So the only way to get this done is shock therapy, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=227.6s)]
*  and it's already getting results. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  You've got to do this to get the high-tech manufacturing [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=233.32s)]
*  back into this country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=236.16s)]
*  You have to have aerospace, steel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=237.52s)]
*  You have to have shipbuilding, medicine, robotics, AI. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=240.32s)]
*  These are the kind of jobs that can go to high-skilled, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=245.16s)]
*  high-wage workers in this country, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=248.56s)]
*  and they have to be done here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=251.04s)]
*  And everybody agrees. Jessica agrees. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=252.72s)]
*  Schumer agrees. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=255.16s)]
*  Everyone's all agreed on this, but for some reason, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  they're criticizing the way Trump's doing it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=259.64s)]
*  Well, what strategy have the Democrats employed? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  Have the Democrats ever brought high-tech manufacturing back? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  Had they ever gotten one other country [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=269.04s)]
*  to lower their trade barriers? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=270.88s)]
*  No, they haven't done any of this. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=272.68s)]
*  All they do is sit back and chirp. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=274.24s)]
*  Now, what you're seeing right now [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=276.64s)]
*  is Trump is getting the entire world [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=279.0s)]
*  to rally with us against the Chinese. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  If he can cut deals so they lower their trade barriers against us, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=284.6s)]
*  invest in the United States, bring their factories here, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=288.72s)]
*  and raise their trade barriers against China, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=291.24s)]
*  what that does to China, it collapses their economy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=294.84s)]
*  Mass unemployment, and then possibly the regime gets toppled. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=297.96s)]
*  So if they don't want their regime getting toppled, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=302.0s)]
*  they have to cut a deal with us [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=304.68s)]
*  so then they can start playing fair, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=306.6s)]
*  because everybody knows they cheat. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=308.16s)]
*  They dump cheap, subsidized products into our market. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=310.4s)]
*  They steal our trade secrets, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=313.12s)]
*  and they send us viruses and fentanyl. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=314.64s)]
*  That has to stop. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=316.72s)]
*  Jessica knows it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=317.72s)]
*  She doesn't have a strategy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=319.04s)]
*  She should just get on board and do the right thing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=320.68s)]
*  Okay. So, Dana, right now we find out that, you know, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=324.08s)]
*  the Democrats said we're going to alienate our allies, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=328.76s)]
*  and they're going to start working with China. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  Now we find out that Australia said no to China. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=334.8s)]
*  We don't want to work with you. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  And Trump is exactly where he wants to be. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=339.36s)]
*  He's got all 75 countries ready to make a deal, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=341.96s)]
*  and he's alienating and isolating China. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  And even Kevin O'Leary says they should actually [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=348.68s)]
*  have a thousand percent tariff on them [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  because they are so corrupt [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=354.56s)]
*  in terms of how they handle the economy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=356.0s)]
*  So lots to agree with, and then a couple things [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=358.4s)]
*  I would maybe say, I'm not sure. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=362.96s)]
*  On the Democrats and helping out, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't understand why they don't, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  because tariffs are a left-wing thing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  And conservatives, for so long, we're like, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  well, I don't think I'm for that, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=373.32s)]
*  because that doesn't make any sense [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=374.44s)]
*  in the law of economics. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=375.68s)]
*  And now you see a lot of Republicans say, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=376.6s)]
*  well, okay, they can be on the team. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=379.2s)]
*  They've decided. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  And like some of them are tying themselves in knots [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=382.36s)]
*  and saying, well, yeah, I know I said something else [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=383.88s)]
*  three years ago, but it doesn't matter now [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  because they're on the team. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=386.44s)]
*  And I actually can't be okay with that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=387.44s)]
*  If you're going to be honest about it, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=389.8s)]
*  like you've changed your mind, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  or you want to be on the side, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  or you want to give it some patience, okay, let's go. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=392.92s)]
*  Let's see how that's going to work. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=395.0s)]
*  But the Democrats, they're not smart enough [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  to figure out that strategy to say, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=399.16s)]
*  oh, he's coming our way. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=402.0s)]
*  Let's co-opt him and put the Republicans in a box. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=404.16s)]
*  Because if they had done that, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  they might have been able to derail the bill [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=408.68s)]
*  that Thune and Johnson were able to pass today. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=411.12s)]
*  That's the president's priorities. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=413.6s)]
*  The Republicans have had not a great week. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  And still the Democrats can't figure out a way to derail [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=417.76000000000005s)]
*  that bill. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=421.0s)]
*  That means to me that the Democrats are in much worse shape [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  than the Republicans are. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=424.44000000000005s)]
*  That they can come together and get that done is important. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  On the point about the other nations [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=427.76s)]
*  being willing to help us, Australia, and also Japan, Korea. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  So we've talked about the shrimpers in Louisiana. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=435.28s)]
*  One of the things that happens, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=438.0s)]
*  if you have a shrimp coming in from other places, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=439.08s)]
*  that's a problem. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=440.88s)]
*  So can that help? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=441.88s)]
*  Maybe, except for that we still have these tariff deals [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=443.8s)]
*  that we need to get done. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=446.36s)]
*  Lutnick was in the cabinet room saying, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=448.0s)]
*  well, it's going to take a long time to do them. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=449.48s)]
*  Time is not something that we have a ton of, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  but there was good news on that front for people [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  because we talked about this yesterday. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=455.48s)]
*  The Treasury Secretary, now apparently, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  the one that is driving. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=460.36s)]
*  He's in the driver's seat, along with the President. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  So now everybody knows, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=465.0s)]
*  if the leaders from the other countries are calling, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=466.24s)]
*  they're not calling around, they're saying, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=468.08s)]
*  Besant President, that's who they're talking to. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think that's important for credibility. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  But on the shrimpers front, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=474.12s)]
*  there's still a 10% tariff everywhere else [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=475.36s)]
*  until we get them all worked out. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=477.12s)]
*  And they buy cables, for example, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=478.68s)]
*  two or three cables a year from South Korea. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=481.0s)]
*  Those are pretty expensive. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=484.36s)]
*  That's where those are made. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=485.36s)]
*  The nets that they need to get, those come from India, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=486.56s)]
*  because that's where the, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=488.96s)]
*  and it will take years [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=489.8s)]
*  in order to get those types of things made here. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=491.08s)]
*  And maybe we don't need to do that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=492.76s)]
*  if we can buy them from somewhere else. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=494.36s)]
*  So that's why those deals are super important [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=496.0s)]
*  to try to get done. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=498.0s)]
*  And I don't think we have a ton of time to do it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, Greg, the truth is that the United States [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=501.0s)]
*  has been pretty much a welcome mat [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=504.96s)]
*  where the other countries just bring in whatever they want, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=508.0s)]
*  whatever tariffs they want. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=511.6s)]
*  And now we're in a position to actually leverage [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=513.36s)]
*  the fact that we're the biggest consumers in the world. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=516.08s)]
*  That's not a question, Judge. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=518.64s)]
*  So let me come up with a question. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=520.12s)]
*  Are the Democrats authentic? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=522.6s)]
*  No, they are not. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=524.12s)]
*  Did you listen to that? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=525.44s)]
*  It was like a bat signal went out. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=526.6s)]
*  They said exactly the same thing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=528.2s)]
*  Just have one original thought. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  And when you get the original thought, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=533.48s)]
*  don't share it with everybody else. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  Expect other people to have their own original thought. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=536.88s)]
*  You are NPCs, non-playing characters in a video game, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=539.4000000000001s)]
*  the background that provides context [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=542.48s)]
*  to people who live real lives, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=545.48s)]
*  who are playing the video game, us. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=547.16s)]
*  The stock market reacts poorly to uncertainty. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=549.2s)]
*  The problem with Trump, uncertainty is his superpower. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=552.32s)]
*  And uncertainty brings people to the table [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=556.04s)]
*  and it scares other people away. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=558.2s)]
*  But we knew this going in. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=560.24s)]
*  You know, Trump wasn't a Trojan horse like Joe Biden [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=562.64s)]
*  who pretended to be middle of the road [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=566.96s)]
*  when he was roadkill in the middle of the road. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=569.44s)]
*  Trump was transparent on trade for 40 years, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=573.16s)]
*  even when people were laughing about it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=575.92s)]
*  But people said, okay, we like the whole package. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  I said I like the whole package, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=580.64s)]
*  even though I ignorant on tariffs. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=582.36s)]
*  I didn't even know what they were like two years ago. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  That's on me, all right? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=588.56s)]
*  But you don't marry Ozzy Osborne [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=590.0799999999999s)]
*  and then act shocked when he does drugs. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=592.52s)]
*  You don't marry Charlie Sheen [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  and act outraged when he's not monogamous. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=597.48s)]
*  We knew what Trump's superpower is [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=600.16s)]
*  and we know how it works and we've accepted it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=602.68s)]
*  Only amateurs use the word cave [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=605.08s)]
*  because clearly you've never engaged in a negotiation. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=607.88s)]
*  A negotiation begins at extremes [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=611.48s)]
*  and you work towards a middle. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=614.24s)]
*  Most of these countries are at a standstill, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=615.92s)]
*  so they got to work towards us. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=617.88s)]
*  It's a process toward agreement. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  It is not a cave when somebody agrees with you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=620.92s)]
*  Likewise, Trump always starts at an extreme, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=623.96s)]
*  an audacious start that resets the table [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=627.72s)]
*  and then you'll work from there. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=631.52s)]
*  The idiots in the media have never worked in a negotiation [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=633.4s)]
*  or if they have, it's through their agent [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  and your agent sucks. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=637.76s)]
*  I've been in negotiations where they've offered me [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=639.64s)]
*  an embarrassingly low number to start [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=641.72s)]
*  and I'm not insulted because I know that's smart. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=644.64s)]
*  Why would you not start at the lowest level? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=647.76s)]
*  Likewise, why would you start at the highest level? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=650.16s)]
*  So I come in with an embarrassingly high number. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=652.96s)]
*  You wouldn't believe the things I have asked for. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=655.3199999999999s)]
*  Some of the things I've asked for, I look back on [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=659.84s)]
*  and I go, I can't believe I asked for that. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=662.12s)]
*  But the thing is, that's how you start. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=665.48s)]
*  You start way over here, they sit wherever [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  and you just, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=669.1600000000001s)]
*  But government doesn't understand that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=671.2800000000001s)]
*  because they're always negotiating [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=672.64s)]
*  with somebody else's money. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=674.2s)]
*  So they don't need to negotiate. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=676.48s)]
*  America is like Tom Brady in his prime [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=678.6s)]
*  and Trump is his agent working on his behalf [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=681.44s)]
*  and if he wasn't a bastard about it, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=685.96s)]
*  he would be derelict in his duties. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=688.1999999999999s)]
*  So you asked Fox for a jet and then you settled on a car. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=690.52s)]
*  This is how you do everything. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=694.4s)]
*  In fact, that's what makes negotiating fun. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=696.52s)]
*  I wish I knew this when I was younger. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=700.4s)]
*  Yeah, me too, I had a terrible negotiation. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=702.12s)]
*  All right, Jessica. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  All right, there's a lot to unpack there. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=705.48s)]
*  I wanna try to, I guess, use different words [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=708.16s)]
*  to make sure that I'm not an NPC Democrat today. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=711.28s)]
*  But I heard you say Trump is exactly where he wants to be [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=715.04s)]
*  and he wouldn't have reshuffled his team [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=718.8399999999999s)]
*  if that were the case. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=721.64s)]
*  He wouldn't have said, Peter Navarro, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=722.5999999999999s)]
*  I never wanna see you again and Howard Lutnick, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=724.64s)]
*  you're the bad cop now, which means that maybe [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=726.56s)]
*  he gets to go on Jesse's show once every couple of weeks. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=728.5999999999999s)]
*  Wait, Navarro is what? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=731.8s)]
*  Navarro is sidelined completely. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=733.24s)]
*  Navarro's on my show tonight. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=736.0s)]
*  So how's he sidelined? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=738.12s)]
*  Well, he's not, according to the reporting, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=739.1999999999999s)]
*  he's not supposed to be. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=741.56s)]
*  Wait, is my show on the sidelines? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=742.4s)]
*  Wait, is it Anna Navarro? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=744.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh no! [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=746.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=748.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=749.0s)]
*  He's just transparent. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=751.48s)]
*  He's also trying to market this as the fact [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=753.0s)]
*  that he paused the tariffs and he absolutely did not. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=755.52s)]
*  He canceled the reciprocal tariffs, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=758.8s)]
*  but we are still, as Dana said, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=760.28s)]
*  tariffing the entire globe 10%, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  even the people that we have good relationships with, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=764.64s)]
*  like Australia. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=766.52s)]
*  And there was questioning of Jameson Greer, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=767.8s)]
*  our trade representative earlier this week, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=769.9599999999999s)]
*  about why we're possibly doing that. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=771.8s)]
*  And he had absolutely no answer for it. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=774.56s)]
*  The Yale Budget Lab just came out with new figures [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=776.1999999999999s)]
*  based on yesterday's tariff numbers. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=778.4s)]
*  It says that this will cost each American household $4,400. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=780.16s)]
*  This is the highest tariff rate since 1909. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=784.4s)]
*  Who came up with that? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=787.56s)]
*  The Yale Budget Lab. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=789.04s)]
*  Oh, not the Yale Budget Lab. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=790.3599999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry that I didn't pull it out of a cartoon [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=792.8s)]
*  or something, wherever you got your point. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=795.4399999999999s)]
*  We'll see it tomorrow, everywhere else. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=796.28s)]
*  The Yale Budget Lab. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=799.04s)]
*  Why are you making fun of smart people [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=801.12s)]
*  that calculate things? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=803.04s)]
*  The Economic Anxiety Index for the US, it's a chart. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=804.68s)]
*  And the number is off the chart now. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=808.7199999999999s)]
*  They can't even keep it on the page. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=810.9599999999999s)]
*  The CEO of Amazon came out and said, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=812.68s)]
*  these tariffs will be passed on to the consumers. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=816.0s)]
*  Our sellers will 100% not be paying them. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  You will be. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=821.16s)]
*  There will be, I think it's 70th. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=822.0s)]

*  You're talking about Bezos? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=823.9599999999999s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=825.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about Andy Jassy, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=826.42s)]
*  who's the CEO of it, actually. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=827.36s)]
*  You guys are talking about this from a very privileged seat, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=830.12s)]
*  where you can say things like, no, you're not. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=834.6s)]
*  Bringing jobs to middle America is not privileged. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=837.04s)]
*  Okay, but this is what it's doing. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=840.04s)]

*  Auto plants are- [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=845.8s)]
*  That had nothing to do with this. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=846.64s)]
*  And how many manufacturing- [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=847.48s)]
*  Yes, it really did. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt_R2pbA2SA&t=848.32s)]
