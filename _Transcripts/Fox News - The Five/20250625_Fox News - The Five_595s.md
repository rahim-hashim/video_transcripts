# ‘The Five’: Socialist SHOCKER in NYC
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU)
*  So a socialist shocker in America's largest city. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=0.0s)]
*  That could mean trouble for Democrats across the country. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=2.64s)]
*  State Assemblyman Zoran Mamdani declaring victory [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=5.68s)]
*  in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=9.68s)]
*  after three term ex-governor Andrew Cuomo [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  conceded the race in a stunning upset. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=15.08s)]
*  The final call still waiting on rank choice, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=17.48s)]
*  but Zoran is already seizing the means of the election. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  Where rent stabilized, apartments are actually stabilized. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  Where buses are fast and free, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=29.1s)]
*  it's where the mayor will use their power [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=34.1s)]
*  to reject Donald Trump's fascism. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=38.34s)]
*  To stop mass ICE agents from deporting our neighbor. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=45.32s)]
*  Tonight was not our night. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=50.22s)]
*  Tonight was Assemblyman Mamdani's night. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=53.5s)]
*  Freezing the rent, city run grocery stores [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=58.92s)]
*  and taxing the you know what out of millionaires [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=61.72s)]
*  to pay for it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=64.36s)]
*  Zoran is running on a socialist platform [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=65.32s)]
*  that would make Bernie and AOC blush. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=67.7s)]
*  Here's just a small sample. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=69.86s)]
*  How many more New Yorkers will you detain? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=72.4s)]
*  How many more New Yorkers will you have choice? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=74.84s)]
*  Do you believe in the First Amendment? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=77.1s)]
*  Do you believe in the First Amendment, Tom Homan? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  The push is defund the NYPD [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=81.08s)]
*  and refund all of these different social services. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=83.44s)]
*  Would it just make you uncomfortable? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=86.44s)]
*  Like the phrase globalize into Fada [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=87.5s)]
*  from the river to the sea? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=89.04s)]
*  You know, I know people for whom those things [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  mean very different things. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=93.04s)]
*  Arabic words can be twisted. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  President Trump couldn't resist taking a shot [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=96.98s)]
*  at the rising socialist with a very lengthy post on truth [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=99.14s)]
*  where he called Zoran quote, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=102.12s)]
*  a 100% communist lunatic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=103.68s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna get a lot of disagreement [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=106.62s)]
*  here on that one. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  Kennedy, the youngster seemed to believe [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=111.72s)]
*  that real socialism has never been tried. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  And they would like to try it now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=118.26s)]
*  What say you? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=119.7s)]
*  I say talk to my family who left, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=120.9s)]
*  fled the communist Soviets from Romania in the 40s. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=125.0s)]
*  And socialism has been tried and it has failed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=131.04s)]
*  and it has failed utterly everywhere. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=132.6s)]
*  And it is a cruel institution [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=134.88s)]
*  with which to shackle citizens. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=137.18s)]
*  And that's exactly what he's selling. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  He's not hiding what he's selling, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=141.32s)]
*  but he does it in such a way it's so slick and polished. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=143.56s)]
*  It's like a teaser episode of Love Island. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  And of course millennials get on board with this [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=149.98s)]
*  because they're sold something that Eric Adams [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=152.14s)]
*  has called snake oil. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=155.18s)]
*  And it's much worse than that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  Look back at the de Blasio era where taxes were high. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=159.22s)]
*  There was a proliferation of mentally ill homeless people [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=163.02s)]
*  all over New York City. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=165.96s)]
*  This is going to be worse than that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=167.42s)]
*  because his contempt for the police [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=169.4s)]
*  is actually greater than Bill de Blasio's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=172.14s)]
*  if you can fathom that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=174.8s)]
*  And he has told you all the things that he despises, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=176.54s)]
*  including a free market. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=179.02s)]
*  Try going to the post office in a city as big as New York. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  Look how that's run. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=185.8s)]
*  Imagine a grocery store run by the city. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=186.98s)]
*  It would be a hell hole. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=190.8s)]
*  And that's just one of a number of things [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=193.06s)]
*  that you can list off. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=196.02s)]
*  Not to mention his virulent anti-Zionism. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=197.78s)]
*  And that's a very nice way of saying anti-Semitism. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=201.48s)]
*  And the way he twists words so offensively [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=204.72s)]
*  to suit himself and his agenda, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=209.28s)]
*  which is scary at best, but deeply racist at its worst. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  Tyrus, it's a major humiliation for Andrew Cuomo. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  I think he had it coming. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=223.0s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't think it was the constituents [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  that voted for him that heard him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=227.88s)]
*  I think it's the constituents that aren't here anymore [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=229.16s)]
*  because of him that heard him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=231.44s)]
*  Senior vote matters. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=232.92s)]
*  And somewhere shout out to Janice Dean. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=233.78s)]
*  Not on our watch, mama. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=235.38s)]
*  So having said that, but listen, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  Jesse, I wanna add, you have very strong convictions [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=239.17999999999998s)]
*  and rules and you don't drink with a straw. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=243.06s)]
*  You don't eat soup in public. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=245.7s)]
*  I would like to add to your list. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=246.98s)]
*  Never trust a man who yells on a microphone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  There is no reason to yell and scream on a microphone. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=252.22s)]
*  And it seems all of his emotional outbursts [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=254.73999999999998s)]
*  are within a foot of a camera. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=257.42s)]
*  So this is also anyone who ever needed [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=259.62s)]
*  to make a motivational commercial [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=263.4s)]
*  for why you don't wanna live in New York, this would be it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=265.48s)]
*  Now the New Yorkers have a choice. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=268.6s)]
*  Mayor Adams, who has put the city before politics, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=270.88s)]
*  that is where you're going. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=276.68s)]
*  The streets are cleaning up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=277.96s)]
*  We're seeing reductions in crime, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=279.2s)]
*  or you're gonna go back to the same old. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=281.12s)]
*  And his socialist is the same. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=284.32s)]
*  Is it Bernie's socialist and all socialists? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=285.6s)]
*  Socialism for you, not for me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  He's gonna make sure he's in the mansion. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=290.0s)]
*  He's gonna make sure he's making money [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  and all these other kinds. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  And everyone else is supposed to share and attack the rich. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  So again, this is a horrible look for New York. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=296.06s)]
*  I hope that the people, this is why I don't live in New York. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=298.46s)]
*  Hopefully they'll make good choices [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=301.56s)]
*  and do what's best for the people, not party. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=303.12s)]
*  Because this guy, the only thing I see him do [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=305.52s)]
*  is yell and scream. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=307.55999999999995s)]
*  And Jesse, I'm hoping that I get approval from you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=308.4s)]
*  to add that to the list of things you don't do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=310.88s)]
*  Put that on the list rules for men. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  Go and ask the control room to pull up [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=315.32s)]
*  and call for number four. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=316.74s)]
*  This is Harry Enton. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=317.56s)]
*  He's the pollster for CNN. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=319.14000000000004s)]
*  The people who hate this result the most [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=322.42s)]
*  are the democratic establishment. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=324.5s)]
*  We have seen poll after poll after poll [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=326.06s)]

*  And Harold, I talked to a Democrat friend today [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=334.74s)]
*  who said he believes that this is a hangover [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=336.70000000000005s)]
*  from Biden's decision to run again [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=339.56s)]
*  and that young people in the Democratic Party [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=341.3s)]
*  have said no more of this. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=343.06s)]
*  We want a new direction. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  Are you going to save the city and run instead? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  So I think you should never underestimate [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  the power of voters who seek a better quality of life. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=354.08s)]
*  The better quality of life could be cleaning up the streets, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=357.96s)]
*  could be providing better jobs, lowering costs. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=360.88s)]
*  The greatest example in the last eight years [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=363.9s)]
*  is now back in the White House. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=366.4s)]
*  President Trump upended the political scene in the country [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=368.32s)]
*  and upended the political dynamics in the country [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=372.2s)]
*  by appealing to Democrats and appealing to Republicans. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=374.58000000000004s)]
*  In this sense, since this young guy, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=377.02000000000004s)]
*  who I didn't vote for, I accept the outcome of this race, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  focus on the things we talk about around his table [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=384.18s)]
*  every once in a while that Democrats ought to get back to, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=386.06s)]
*  which is an affordability agenda. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=387.82000000000005s)]
*  The question is, can he convince this, Mr. Madhami, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  can he convince voters between now [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=392.18s)]
*  and implicating the point that Tyrus is making, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=394.18s)]
*  can he convince voters that giving away everything for free [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=397.3s)]
*  is the way to actually make their lives better? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  He proved in the primary that it was. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=405.28s)]
*  Now, did he have, were there the candidates, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  toughest candidates in that race? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=409.44s)]
*  I don't know, I followed the race [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  and I had my choice in the race. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=412.32s)]
*  Eric Adams and him in the fall, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  I think this will be the most consequential race [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=415.96s)]
*  that New York City has faced, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  certainly in my 20 years living here, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=421.12s)]
*  and I would argue over the last half century, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  because of the direction this young man [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=425.96s)]
*  wants to take the city, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=427.52s)]
*  and it's incumbent upon Eric Adams, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=428.7s)]
*  who will be on the ballot in the fall, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=430.86s)]
*  to lay out a positive, tough-minded agenda [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=433.26s)]
*  for where the city's gonna go and how he's gonna achieve it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=437.94s)]
*  It's not gonna be enough just to criticize this young man, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=440.41999999999996s)]
*  because they did that in this campaign here at Inwork. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=442.5s)]
*  You've gotta lay out where you wanna take the city. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=444.38s)]
*  And if he does that, if Eric Adams does it, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=447.14s)]
*  then the city will have an opportunity to choose [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=450.09999999999997s)]
*  between the vision that Mr. Madhami's offering [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=451.74s)]
*  and the vision that Mr. Adams wants to pursue. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=454.06s)]
*  It wasn't just what he was selling, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=456.76s)]
*  it was how he sold it, Jesse. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=458.04s)]
*  He is very prolific on social media, especially TikTok. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=459.36s)]
*  And his mother is a film producer, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=463.64s)]
*  and many of his ads and the things that they put up [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=466.12s)]
*  on social media were very attractive. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=469.12s)]
*  They had the merch, and it became like a vibe campaign, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=471.12s)]
*  which helped put him over the edge. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=473.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, you can't blame the blacks and Hispanics. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  They voted for Cuomo. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=478.24s)]
*  You gotta blame the whites. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=479.32s)]
*  They wanted communism, and they got it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  They loved communism in college, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=482.88s)]
*  and then they graduated with no skills [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=485.08s)]
*  and $200,000 in debt, and they came into a city [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=487.34s)]
*  that's hard to get ahead with high prices. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=491.62s)]
*  So they see this kid on TikTok talking about [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=493.82s)]
*  he's gonna soak the rich and he's gonna control prices, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=496.34s)]
*  and they say, that's my guy. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=499.94s)]
*  Okay, so he gets into the city, y'all, and then what? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=501.34s)]
*  He's just gonna attack the country, cops and capitalism? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=503.68s)]
*  He's just gonna cause more crime and chaos. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=507.38s)]
*  He's gonna turn the prisons inside out, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=509.62s)]
*  and he's gonna turn Whole Foods into No Foods. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=512.54s)]
*  This is what happens when you let the wacky wing [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=516.0999999999999s)]
*  of the Democrat Party run wild. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=518.88s)]
*  This is what the Democrat establishment's been trying [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=520.8s)]
*  to keep a lid on for decades since Occupy Wall Street. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=523.36s)]
*  Biden tried to keep a lid on it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  Cuomo couldn't keep a lid on it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  This is the Bernie bro, Dave Hogg, AOC faction [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=532.14s)]
*  that's now gonna run wild all over the place, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=536.38s)]
*  and you're basically giving this, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=538.78s)]
*  I guess he's a Muslim communist from another country, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=541.26s)]
*  city hall in the best city in the world. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=545.66s)]
*  This is the financial capital of the world. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=548.86s)]
*  It's the biggest city in America, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=551.88s)]
*  and you're gonna run a communist out. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=555.32s)]
*  I thought I was right when I said we'd hit rock bottom [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=557.92s)]
*  with Bill de Blasio. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=561.66s)]
*  I was wrong, and it takes a big man [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=563.14s)]
*  to admit they were wrong, but I was wrong. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=565.1s)]
*  And so this guy is gonna do his thing, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=566.96s)]
*  and thank God I left for Jersey. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrdJ-0xjrU&t=569.62s)]
