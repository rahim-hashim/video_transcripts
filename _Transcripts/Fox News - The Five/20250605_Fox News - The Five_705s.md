# ‘The Five’ on Elon Musk and Trump’s fiery feud
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY)
*  It is the Trump travel ban 2.0 in the wake of the horrific firebomb terror attack against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=0.0s)]
*  a Jewish gathering in Boulder, Colorado, done at the hands of an illegal immigrant who overstayed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=9.48s)]
*  his visa. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=14.42s)]
*  President Trump is issuing a sweeping new travel ban that covers 12 countries and partially [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=16.0s)]
*  restricts entry to the U.S. from seven others. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=20.68s)]
*  Earlier, he explained why in the Oval. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=24.12s)]
*  It can't come soon enough, frankly. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  We want to keep bad people out of our country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=30.0s)]
*  The Biden administration allowed some horrendous people, and we're getting them out one by [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=33.2s)]
*  one. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  And we're not stopping until we get them out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  We have thousands of murderers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=41.32s)]
*  We want to get them out. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=43.44s)]
*  We want to get them out now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=44.44s)]
*  We don't want to have other bad people coming into our country by using the word bad and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=45.44s)]
*  being nice. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=49.92s)]
*  But the media smells a distraction trying to make the travel ban all about Elon Musk's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=51.92s)]
*  recent criticisms of President Trump's big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=56.96s)]
*  The other obvious reason for announcing the travel ban tonight that will take effect on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=61.44s)]
*  Monday is to turn our attention away from Elon Musk's war on Donald Trump. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=67.44s)]
*  Trump has issued a travel ban. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=77.12s)]
*  And I think that is very effective for this president in terms of changing the direction [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=79.16s)]
*  of headlines. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=83.6s)]
*  The president made a series of announcements just yesterday going out for former President [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=84.6s)]
*  Biden announcing this, certainly knowing that it would change the topic. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=87.72s)]
*  Speaking of which, President Trump is responding to Musk. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=92.72s)]
*  Elon and I had a great relationship. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=96.96s)]
*  I don't know if we're well anymore. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=100.88s)]
*  He's worn the hat. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=102.28s)]
*  Trump was right about everything. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=103.8s)]
*  Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=105.52s)]
*  And he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=110.56s)]
*  the EV mandate. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=113.36s)]
*  I'm very disappointed in Elon. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=114.36s)]
*  I've helped Elon a lot. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=116.0s)]
*  And I'll be honest, I think he misses the place. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  He actually went up in campaign for me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=119.88s)]
*  I think I would have won. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=122.32s)]
*  Suzy would say I would have won Pennsylvania easily anyway. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=123.32s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=126.32s)]
*  But Musk is firing back quite a lot on X. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  And it continues right now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=130.6s)]
*  It all started with this post that said, quote, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=131.92s)]
*  Without me, Trump would have lost the election. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=134.39999999999998s)]
*  Greg? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=138.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=139.6s)]
*  Where are you going with this? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=140.44s)]
*  Well, I think what you're seeing is a battle between the purist and the pragmatist. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=145.72s)]
*  I want it to stop. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  I want to tell them if they're both watching, knock it off. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  We're done with this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  This is an incredible moment for our country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=153.76s)]
*  It's awake. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=156.64s)]
*  It's optimistic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  It's on board with the golden age. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=159.32s)]
*  Don't sabotage it with the self-inflicted feud. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=161.64s)]
*  Don't let the Dems get back up from the floor where they belong. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=166.83999999999997s)]
*  You got two really successful people, billionaires. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  And they both, I guess, have egos. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=174.44s)]
*  But they also have different ways of seeing things. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=176.72s)]
*  The great thing about this is we all see it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  This is an incredibly transparent administration. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  This isn't a bug in the system. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=185.92s)]
*  This is the system. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=187.92s)]
*  So I want you to compare this system to the one that ended in 2020. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  Would you take a forceful president and a billionaire publicly feuding in public [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  over an invalid president who was kept hidden from the public, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=200.64s)]
*  leaving the country without a leader? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  I'll take this any day. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  At least I know what's going on. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=209.2s)]
*  And I can somewhat enjoy it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=211.04s)]
*  But I want them to stop. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  I've had it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  This is like, I don't want to see my parents fighting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=215.12s)]
*  I just want them to get back to, I like Batman and Robin. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=218.72s)]
*  I don't like spy versus spy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=222.52s)]
*  Can I just finish up on all the outrage over the travel ban and stuff? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=224.64s)]
*  This is a collision between adult actions and childish ideals. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=229.68s)]
*  You know, the hysterics have gone without adult supervision for so long. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=234.16s)]
*  And the muscle of deterrence have atrophied. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=240.88s)]
*  They don't know what it's like. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=243.24s)]
*  That's why every time Trump takes an adult action, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=244.36s)]
*  it's like a big bucket of ice water on their head. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=247.4s)]
*  But the travel bans, deportations, the criminal roundups, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=250.6s)]
*  these are a course correction necessary after four years of children running [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=254.8s)]
*  the candy store, doling out benefits and cash to everybody. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=259.64s)]
*  They happily forfeited their adult role to be basically a global Santa Claus. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=263.6s)]
*  I mean, you could have protected the country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=268.96s)]
*  This wouldn't have happened. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=270.72s)]
*  But now the adults are in charge. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=271.6s)]
*  You know, Kaylee, do you see this as a big distraction from all the good work [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=273.24s)]
*  that this administration has been able to do up to date? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=276.84s)]
*  Will this only distract from any of those moments? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't see it as a distraction. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=283.0s)]
*  Yes, the liberal media will go nuts over this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  They have been all week. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  But this was predictable. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=287.52s)]
*  You have the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=288.88s)]
*  and the most powerful man in the world, President Donald Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  For this to work, the richest man in the world would have had to subjugate [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  his ego to the most powerful man, because guess who the American people elected? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  The man sitting behind the resolute desk you are looking at. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  And Elon Musk, he did a lot of good. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  He brought attention to spending, to cutting spending. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=306.56s)]
*  No one wants to touch that issue. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=309.6s)]
*  He touched it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=310.92s)]
*  And there was a lot of personal backlash. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=311.52s)]
*  He lost value in his companies. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=313.08s)]
*  He got death threats. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=314.92s)]
*  But ultimately, President Trump is the one who won the election. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=316.44s)]
*  For Elon Musk to say, I won Trump this election, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=319.92s)]
*  President Trump won all of the swing states. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=323.52s)]
*  He is the first person in the Republican Party [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=326.24s)]
*  to win the popular vote in 20 years. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=328.44s)]
*  He had the highest raw vote total of any Republican nominee [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=330.32s)]
*  ever in the history of the party, increased double digits [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=333.56s)]
*  over the last four years among Latinos, black, and young people. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=336.32s)]
*  No amount of money bought that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=340.2s)]
*  What bought that was a movement. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=341.92s)]
*  And Elon Musk had to decide, I'm either going to fold into this [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=344.08s)]
*  or go away from this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=347.68s)]
*  And he chose to go away from this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=348.8s)]
*  I think it's a sad thing to see. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=350.48s)]
*  I agree with you, Greg. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=351.56s)]
*  I don't want to see the adults fighting, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=352.96s)]
*  but I do think this was predictable. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=354.6s)]
*  Well, Harold, what are your Democrat friends saying [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=355.84s)]
*  about what looks like a breakup at the moment? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=357.92s)]
*  So Sandra, good to, I'm glad you're here and glad Kayleigh's here. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=360.96s)]
*  My Democrat friends are disappointed too. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  No one wants to see this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=366.44000000000005s)]
*  I don't think this is a Democrat or Republican thing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  We should just call it for what it is. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  The adults are not in charge. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=371.36s)]
*  The president did benefit from Mr. Musk. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  If you go back and replay and we talk about the things [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=375.68s)]
*  that we say on this show, we were right on border security. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  We were right on the cognitive decline of the president. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  And we thought we were right about this relationship [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=384.72s)]
*  with the two of them. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=386.72s)]
*  I'm hoping, I agree with you, this is not a partisan thing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=387.36s)]
*  I hope they're able to repair this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=389.68s)]
*  For the richest person in the world who [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  happens to live in America and has dual citizenship, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=392.92s)]
*  I think, but here in South Africa. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  And for the president of the United States [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=396.56s)]
*  who had a relationship a year ago, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=398.32s)]
*  they were the greatest of pals. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=399.8s)]
*  And for the world to see this is just simply not a good thing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=401.6s)]
*  Two, he said something. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  He said two things, Mr. Musk did, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=406.88s)]
*  and the president said another thing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Musk said that he was responsible for this when [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=410.72s)]
*  and responsible for the Senate and the House. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=415.92s)]
*  It's interesting the way he said that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if I agree with him on that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=419.64s)]
*  I think you make a good point, Kayleigh. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=420.88s)]
*  But we're going to see what he means by that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=422.72s)]
*  Then he said something else. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=424.2s)]
*  He said, the president's only around for three and a half years. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=424.96s)]
*  I'm around for 40 years. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=427.24s)]
*  Now, I take that to mean to those in politics, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=428.96s)]
*  Democrat and Republican, that I'm going to be a kingmaker, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=431.64s)]
*  continue to be a kingmaker in politics. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=434.44s)]
*  And then the president said that he would cancel [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=436.36s)]
*  some of the contracts. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=438.76s)]
*  That the way to save money would be to cancel contracts. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=439.68s)]
*  I've never been one to think that the president was totally [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=443.68s)]
*  consumed by revenge and retribution. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=446.36s)]
*  Not in my party, and others have said it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  I think at times he's human. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=450.0s)]
*  He's got flesh. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=451.4s)]
*  So he wants to punch back at people who punch him. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=452.4s)]
*  But why, if you really believe, we said eight weeks ago, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  12 weeks ago on this show that, but for Elon, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=457.79999999999995s)]
*  we wouldn't have a space program. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  But for Elon Musk, we might not have the ability [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=461.35999999999996s)]
*  to communicate around the globe like we do. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=464.35999999999996s)]
*  And certainly Ukrainians wouldn't have been able [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=466.2s)]
*  to do what they did against Russia, but for Starlink. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  I've sat on this show and we bragged about his prowess [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  as a technologist. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=473.67999999999995s)]
*  So I just hope, to Greg's points, I agree with you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  I hope they're able to dial this back and deescalate [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  because we may be motivated by different reasons, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=479.88s)]
*  but I don't like it because it's not good for the country. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=483.24s)]
*  It's not good for how we look around the globe. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=484.8s)]
*  But I gotta tell you, there are a lot of, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=486.8s)]
*  some of my Democratic friends, Andrew, who are saying, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=488.36s)]
*  let them fight, just like they just go on [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=490.68s)]
*  with the old political kind of thing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=492.24s)]
*  My enemy, if my friend, if my enemy is fighting [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=493.48s)]
*  with the enemy, then it's okay. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  And then remember, Elon was a Democrat [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=497.44s)]
*  for a long, long time. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=499.12s)]
*  So, and last, I hope, I don't mind the travel ban, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=499.94s)]
*  but I do, it's interesting that Egypt is not a part of it, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=502.88s)]
*  and the guy was from Egypt in Colorado. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=505.52s)]
*  And as we talked about before, I wish they'd start tracking [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=507.84s)]
*  people who want to learn how to build [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  Molotov cocktails online. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=511.0s)]
*  If you go and try to build a bomb, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=513.08s)]
*  we should know who you are. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=514.92s)]
*  I can't buy Robitussin at a drug store [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=515.8s)]
*  without presenting ID and being on camera. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=517.8s)]
*  How can you go online and learn how to build [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=519.92s)]
*  a Molotov cocktail and we don't track you? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=521.72s)]
*  Jesse, I wonder if this means Harold's friends [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=524.16s)]
*  will start buying Teslas again. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=526.12s)]
*  They never stopped. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=529.0s)]
*  And maybe Trump will torch the one that Musk gave him. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=530.12s)]
*  Sometimes when you're angry, you say things you don't mean. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=533.92s)]
*  Greg knocked my hair last week, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=537.0s)]
*  and I said, he's on the Epstein list. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=538.68s)]
*  Yeah, you did. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=540.6s)]
*  No, I didn't mean that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  I made it up. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=542.96s)]
*  How did you know, though? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=543.8s)]
*  How did Musk know? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=545.08s)]
*  No one knows what the list is, he didn't know. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=546.64s)]
*  But sometimes guys fight. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  Guys sometimes will punch you in the face, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=550.6s)]
*  and the next night you're having a beer. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=553.12s)]
*  Sleep with your girlfriend and you patch things up. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=554.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=557.52s)]
*  What? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=558.36s)]
*  Who was your girlfriend? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  Who your girlfriend? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=561.24s)]
*  No one slept with my girlfriend, let's put it that way. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=562.88s)]
*  Oh my word. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=565.0s)]
*  These guys are like roommates. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=566.04s)]
*  They were living in close quarters [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=567.4s)]
*  for like the first six months of the year. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  They're just blowing off steam. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=571.16s)]
*  The issue is donor maintenance. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=573.56s)]
*  This guy's the mega donor. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=576.24s)]
*  So you don't want him accusing you of being a pedophile, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=577.6s)]
*  and you don't want him calling for your impeachment. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=581.0s)]
*  I hope he doesn't mean that, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  but maybe they can patch things up. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=586.48s)]
*  I mean, Vance called Trump Hitler and he's on the ticket. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=587.72s)]
*  My issue is that the media said [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=591.62s)]
*  that Musk was the co-president. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=594.04s)]
*  He doesn't look like the co-president anymore. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=596.28s)]
*  The media said Trump was doing favors for Elon Musk. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=598.48s)]
*  Well, if you look at this big, beautiful bill, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=602.24s)]
*  there's no favors for Elon Musk in it at all. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=604.24s)]
*  Now the big, beautiful bill, now he's got a beef with it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=607.32s)]
*  These are the things that Trump ran on and won on. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=610.4s)]
*  Wall, ice skies so you could do mass deportations, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=614.28s)]
*  military F-35 ships, pay raises for the troops, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=619.24s)]
*  and tax relief for everybody, no tax on tips. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=623.12s)]
*  These are the things that won him the election. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=626.44s)]
*  He didn't run on balancing the budget. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  So this is the priority right now. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=630.24s)]
*  You have four years to balance the budget. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=632.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of pork in this thing. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=634.4s)]
*  There's always a little pork, all right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=635.76s)]
*  But this is not a spending bill. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=637.44s)]
*  This is the signature piece of Donald Trump's second term. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  This may be the last major piece of legislation [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=642.72s)]
*  Trump ever passes. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=646.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, he might have three terms, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=648.36s)]
*  but for now we're saying this is it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=649.6s)]
*  Now I don't like the fact that he said [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=652.2s)]
*  that he won the election. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=653.84s)]
*  This guy got shot, popped back right up. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=655.36s)]
*  He won all the swing states. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=657.6400000000001s)]
*  He was always ahead in the polls. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=659.1600000000001s)]
*  The money was great. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=660.88s)]
*  Trust me, the money helped. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=662.6s)]
*  Thank you, Elon Musk. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=664.2s)]
*  But if money wins elections, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=665.36s)]
*  Kamala should have coasted, she had twice the cash. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=667.1600000000001s)]
*  And if money wins elections, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=670.12s)]
*  then Elon should have been able to win those seats [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=671.44s)]
*  in Wisconsin. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=673.6400000000001s)]
*  So Trump so far has taken the high road. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=675.36s)]
*  I think Elon right now, think about it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=678.44s)]
*  I thought he was gonna call him a drug addict [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=681.7600000000001s)]
*  about an hour ago. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=683.84s)]
*  He hasn't called him that yet. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=684.72s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=685.88s)]
*  I think Trump should just take the high road, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=686.72s)]
*  let Elon blow off some steam. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=688.84s)]
*  They're both powerful men, great men, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=690.48s)]
*  and they'll patch it up. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=692.6s)]
*  The night is young, that is for sure. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpHYlTXXsY&t=694.88s)]
