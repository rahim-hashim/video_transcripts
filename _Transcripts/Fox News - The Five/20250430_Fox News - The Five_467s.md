# Gutfeld: Democrats' 100 days is 'worse than watching paint dry'
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY)
*  Chuck Schumer tried to pull an all-nighter in the Senate to protest Trump's first 100 days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=0.0s)]
*  He accused 47 of being a mob boss, but he couldn't last. They gave it up at midnight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And after getting called out on his 17 percent favorability rating, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=11.28s)]
*  Schumer was back embarrassing his party today and he brought some friends. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=15.68s)]
*  Donald Trump's first 100 days can be defined by one big F word. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=20.48s)]
*  Failure. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=27.2s)]
*  This is not Joe Biden's economy, Donald. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=30.88s)]
*  It is your economy. It is the Trump economy. It is a failed economy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=36.0s)]
*  But at least they're wrangling the hog. According to a new report, the DNC could vote to oust their [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=42.64s)]
*  vice chair, David Hogg, after he vowed to primary Old Guard Democrats. They're going to hear a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=47.6s)]
*  challenge next month by a Native American DNC member. Hogg also facing the wrath of Carville. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=53.84s)]
*  What is your plan to deal with our abominable approval rating? When elections, when elections. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=63.2s)]
*  Judge Jeanine Pirro, when you're supposed to do an all-nighter, does it count if you go to bed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=72.0s)]
*  before midnight? I gotta tell you, the whole thing is laughable. I mean, the guy says he's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=78.24s)]
*  going to do an all-nighter and he's got to go to sleep at midnight. I mean, come on. Your favorability [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=84.8s)]
*  rating is 17 percent. It can't stay up. And then, you know, you actually, it's time for him to go. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=90.64s)]
*  And for him to not have anything to say. I mean, think about it, Jesse. How many presidents did he [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  work for when he was in the Congress? I think in the 80s. So you had Reagan and then you had [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=104.96s)]
*  the first Bush and then Clinton and the second Bush and then you had Obama and then you had Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=112.24s)]
*  That's seven presidents and the best idea he's got is to do an all-nighter and he can't even do that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=119.28s)]
*  You know, this is why you've got people like Hogg who were interested in taking these people out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=126.16s)]
*  And you look at the Republican Party and we've got people like Thune and Mike Johnson and, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=132.32s)]
*  you know, people with energy. And our president, who is actually older than Chuck Schumer, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=137.6s)]
*  he can run circles around him, you know, from now until, you know, next year. It really is a question [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=142.88s)]
*  of whether or not they've got the energy and the intellect as well as the ideas for the Democrat [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=149.28s)]
*  Party. And ironically, the Democrat Party is that they're failing at masculinity, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=156.4s)]
*  they're failing at intellect, they don't know what to do. Donald Trump is crushing them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=162.16s)]
*  Jessica, Dave Hogg's gonna get cooed by a Native American. I don't need to know anything else. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=167.36s)]
*  I'm for the Native American. They deserve it. That actually shocks me. I think it's the first time [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  that you've ever said something like that. You're on the side of Native Americans. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=177.68s)]
*  Something nonsensical is that? No, that happened a lot yesterday even. And I miss you here. It [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=182.16s)]
*  feels very empty over here to my left. The Democratic Party is, we're fixing ourselves. We [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=187.84s)]
*  don't have a unified leadership structure, a lot of different voices that are making an impact and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=195.76s)]
*  connecting with people. But give us a little bit of time and we'll find our footing. Donald Trump [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=202.32s)]
*  is working at a breakneck pace and as usual, we've got to keep up with it. But I do think that if [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=207.68s)]
*  they move forward with this big beautiful bill, that that will be a tremendous opportunity for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=213.68s)]
*  the Democrats because the $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, if it goes through as it is now, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=218.88s)]
*  will be the undoing of the Republican Party in the midterms. There are a number of swing district [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  Republicans who have hundreds of thousands more people on Medicaid in their districts than the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=229.52s)]
*  margins that they won by. People like David Valadeo in California who's had concerns about [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=234.64s)]
*  this bill, Mike Lawler here in New York. And if the Republicans make them take that vote to get [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=239.83999999999997s)]
*  the big tax cuts, to balloon the deficit, explode it, balloon it, however you want to say it, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  and they're going to have people in their districts losing their Medicaid, there is no way that the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=253.04s)]
*  Democrats don't retake the House in 2026 and have a chance of picking up some important Senate seats [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=258.56s)]
*  as well. Dana, she's making a lot of predictions today. A lot of predictions. I didn't say blue wave, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=263.76s)]
*  you know, I'm not like a red wave rider like you have been, but I'm just saying don't take away [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=269.92s)]
*  people's health care. They don't like that. Does it matter if they're legal or illegal? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=273.92s)]
*  Even though Obama took it away. Let's get Dana in. Dana, what? I think she's wrong on a couple [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=278.8s)]
*  of things and here's a point. I'm sorry, I mean, but I'm within, I'm not within striking distance, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=284.4s)]
*  so I'm going to take my shot. Okay, so first of all, what the Democrats are talking about in terms [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=290.88s)]
*  of the big beautiful bill is that they want to deny a middle class tax cut. So first of all, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=296.24s)]
*  I do not believe that President Trump is going to sign a bill that cuts Medicaid. I don't. I don't [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=302.8s)]
*  believe it. And I think that the Democrats are going to go into this saying that's always going [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=307.36s)]
*  to happen or that your Social Security is going to get cut. None of those things ever end up turning [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=311.44s)]
*  out to be true. They are the scare tactics. But if you start telling people who are already souring [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=315.12s)]
*  on this economy, and one of the reasons the president's numbers are down that across the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=320.24s)]
*  board that the Democrats want to deny a middle class tax cut and all those taxes are going to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=324.56s)]
*  increase as well. I don't care what they do on Medicaid. That is like the one of the worst ideas [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=329.44s)]
*  and some numbers came out yesterday since we apparently like numbers on the show today. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  The NRCC, that's the Republican congressional arm. They did a hundred day polling and the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=339.04s)]
*  congressional ballot for the midterm of 2026 is six points closer than it usually is. What is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  that tell you? To me, it says the Democrats one have no ideas, two, they're so unpopular and so [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=350.0s)]
*  uncool that even for people who think, I don't really love what's going on in the first hundred [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=355.68s)]
*  days of the Trump administration, they're not going over that to the Democrats and they don't [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=360.48s)]
*  have a lot of time to make that up. Greg the Schumer F-bomb joke bombed. You know how that feels. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=364.24s)]
*  I do. I do. I felt very bad for him. You know, he should just emulate Joe, walk toward the light, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=370.88s)]
*  trade in AOC for a visiting angel. It's embarrassing. You know, the hundred days of the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=378.0s)]
*  Dems, it's not, it's worse than watching paint dry. It's like watching sour milk curdle. They're [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=383.84s)]
*  not getting any better. I'm with Jessie on the Native American. You know, she's citing fairness [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=389.28s)]
*  and gender diversity as a reason to eject hog. I'm with her. I mean, how do they pick another [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  white guy born of white privilege? I mean, first they're bringing back Columbus Day and now they're [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=402.56s)]
*  doing this. You know, if he wants to live by the woke, he's got to die by the woke. You know, it's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=408.88s)]
*  like a cannibal covered in peanut butter. The Democrats are eating themselves and that's where [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=413.44s)]
*  the real chaos is. They keep projecting chaos. They are possessed with chaos because the ideology [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=418.48s)]
*  of identity politics has created this internal competition, this bitter competition between who [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=425.92s)]
*  is the most aggrieved, you know, who has victim status and they can't agree on it. The only thing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=432.0s)]
*  that can unite them is their distaste for Trump, but that's not enough. And that's why Republicans [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=438.56s)]
*  under Trump are thriving because they're not looking at each other. They're looking outward [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=444.72s)]
*  at the world with shared experiences, trying to see what problem they can solve rather than [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=449.36s)]
*  looking at each other and saying, that's not fair. I deserve that job. Click here to subscribe to the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lfAHoRqBY&t=454.24s)]
