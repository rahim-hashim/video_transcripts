# Gutfeld: Biden was the perfect 'house guest' in the White House
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk)
*  It looks like sleepy has awoken from his slumber. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Biden will deliver his first public speech later this evening in Chicago. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=3.24s)]
*  And privately, the Democrats aren't thrilled. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=8.08s)]
*  One ex-Biden campaign adviser puts a quote, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=10.76s)]
*  the country would be better served if he rode off into the sunset. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=13.68s)]
*  And check out Rahm Emanuel's lackluster response to the big guy's reemergence. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=18.2s)]
*  To me, from a pure Democratic Party interest, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=23.68s)]
*  I'd rather focus both on voices and people thinking about the future, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=27.16s)]
*  how they're going to fight for the American dream in the middle class of this country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=31.04s)]
*  President Biden's voice is important, but understanding the strategic landscape we're in. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=35.28s)]
*  President Trump is using that as his kind of backboard. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  And that's not helpful not only for the country, most importantly, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=44.0s)]
*  but also the Democrats who want to talk about and go into the future, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=47.08s)]
*  make this a referendum on Donald Trump and his tenure. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=49.92s)]
*  So, Jessica, why is Joe coming out now? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=53.6s)]
*  Is anyone going to listen? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=58.72s)]
*  And he didn't want to talk too much for four years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Now he's coming out to give his speech. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=64.04s)]
*  Well, it's been a while. It's not actually like he's appeared that much. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  And we're having this day of action around cuts to Social Security. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=68.68s)]
*  And it's an incredibly salient political issue. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=72.48s)]
*  It affects millions of Americans. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=74.92s)]
*  It keeps millions of seniors out of poverty. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  So I understand why he wants to talk about it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=80.12s)]
*  But I really don't think that it matters. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=81.96s)]
*  I think Rahm Emanuel is generally right about it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=84.36s)]
*  He's going to give a speech. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  There'll be little fanfare. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  I think Democrats are focused on how we can win in the midterms and then hopefully again in 2028. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=90.08s)]
*  And there are some signs that the tide is shifting in our proverbial direction, you know, being up on the generic ballot. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=96.44s)]
*  This is now the first time since May 2021 that Democrats are favored as to who can better handle the economy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  And those are the kinds of things that I'm focused on. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=109.36s)]
*  All right, Dana, why does Joe Biden have no library plans? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  You're a library expert on Reagan and Bush. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, it takes a lot. I don't know why. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you got to raise a lot of money to make it happen. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=122.8s)]
*  And you have to have a really strong network and you have to have everything in place and you have to have a strong like group around you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  And what about a medical library for his treatment? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=134.6s)]
*  Just to keep him in there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=139.76s)]
*  No, for Dr. Jill. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=140.72s)]
*  Yes, Dr. Jill, she could make one. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=141.96s)]
*  I assume that it's not wanted and they don't think it would be worth the money. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=144.04s)]
*  And I also think that there are most Democrats today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=148.0s)]
*  You know how when you schedule dinner with somebody way in advance or a speech and then you're like, oh, I hope somebody cancels. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  I hope somebody cancels. Democrats all day long have been like, why didn't Biden cancel this speech? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=158.84s)]
*  Because they don't want him to drive a news cycle. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=163.0s)]
*  Because it just brings up all the other things like all the books that talk about his inner circle. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=165.72s)]
*  And also, like we did in the previous block, we were talking about the harm that has been done to this country because of the border policy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=170.84s)]
*  And now they let everybody in and we're expected to go one by one to get everybody out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=177.8s)]
*  That doesn't it doesn't make any sense. And there's a tremendous harm to the country from that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  The other thing is a story we haven't really talked too much about is that Kamala Harris is planning to create a think tank on policy and ideas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=187.08s)]
*  That is actually one of my favorite stories. They do not have a leader. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=193.88s)]
*  Cory Booker gave a speech for 24 hours. No one remembers it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  The fact that he gave a speech for 24 hours is not important. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  They have a huge problem. And I also say what cuts to Social Security? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=204.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Well, to be honest, Jesse, the name of the group that he's speaking to is it's a keynote for advocates, counselors and representatives for the disabled. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  I wonder why they called him to do the keynote. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, he needs the money because the Chinese aren't bribing his family anymore and Hunter's broke. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=224.12s)]
*  So you're going to see a lot of him on the speaker circuit. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=229.0s)]
*  And I love it. First, in the beginning of the week, they're defending MS-13. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=231.76s)]
*  Now they're going to have to talk about the big guy for the next 48 hours. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=236.44s)]
*  And they'll probably say the Easter Bunny's trans by the weekend. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=239.6s)]
*  You know how these things go. This guy is hated. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=243.68s)]
*  No one wants to see him out there, but he hates them more than they hate him. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=248.28s)]
*  He's mad at Nancy, Chuck and Barack. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=252.28s)]
*  And he's mad at all the donors for freezing out his cash. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=254.72s)]
*  And he's pissed at all of his ex, all of his people that work for him for leaking to all of these authors. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=257.48s)]
*  So he's going to come out and he's going to lay everybody out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=263.12s)]
*  He's going to say, I told you, look what Doge is doing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=265.6s)]
*  Look at the stock market, even though it's off like seven percent. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=268.52s)]
*  And in his second year, it was down 18 percent. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=271.72s)]
*  And then he's going to crow about Social Security. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=274.68s)]
*  Obviously, there's no cuts there. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=276.92s)]
*  He is a failed president. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=278.96s)]
*  And remember how he went out. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=281.68s)]
*  It was an explosion of corruption with all these stupid pardons that he never explained. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=283.56s)]
*  His party is at 21 percent approval rating. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=287.88s)]
*  They don't want him anywhere near him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=290.56s)]
*  And Kamala is his legacy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=292.28s)]
*  And what is Kamala doing? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=294.6s)]
*  Kamala might run again and lose again. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=296.04s)]
*  So he's going to give birth to two losses through Kamala Harris. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=299.64s)]
*  And he's going to be speaking because he's so broke for the next two years. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=303.6s)]
*  And these are the factors that are going to keep the White House in Republican hands. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=307.44s)]
*  All right. Greg, did you know that during Cory Booker's filibuster, the 25 hour filibuster, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=313.24s)]
*  it's not really a filibuster, but he used the word fabulous 98 times. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  That's fabulous. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=323.68s)]
*  Fabulous is an underused word. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=325.0s)]
*  It's often directed at me when I wake up every morning. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=327.48s)]
*  I want to address your concerns or the Democrat concerns over this possible chaotic speech [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=331.0s)]
*  of Joe Biden. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=339.48s)]
*  They should just go to him right now and tell him he did a great job. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=341.08s)]
*  Just say, Joe, that was amazing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=345.84s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=347.28s)]
*  The speech. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=348.52s)]
*  It was incredible. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=349.56s)]
*  And then you have like fake. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=350.56s)]
*  You just doctor up some fake articles and go, look, Biden kills it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=352.08s)]
*  Joe Biden presided over the fall of his party, but it wasn't his fault. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=357.84s)]
*  You know, he was given a ceremonial post under the assumption that the machine would run itself. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=362.44s)]
*  But the machine was operated by a resentful mob of deconstructionists who want to unpack biology, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=368.64s)]
*  crime, gender, capitalism, work, speech. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=376.0s)]
*  They wanted to take it all apart. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  But as long as Joe had Air Force One, a cool jacket, a place to nap, fluorescent duct tape [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=381.44s)]
*  on the ground to lead him down his path, he wasn't going to complain. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=388.92s)]
*  He wasn't a president. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=393.12s)]
*  He was the perfect house guest because it never was his house. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=394.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=400.08s)]
*  All right. Up next, President Trump dropping the hammer on woke Harvard. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=401.48s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=411.44s)]
*  You won't get it anywhere else. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcvRYEHCPRk&t=413.36s)]
