# ‘The Five’: Shocking new info on Biden’s alleged decline shakes Democrats
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo)
*  PP, I'll come to you first on this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=0.0s)]
*  Is Jake Sullivan's answer there, do you believe believable or credible? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=3.52s)]
*  No. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=7.4s)]
*  But I mean, first of all, when all these books are coming out, why not cancel your media [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=8.4s)]
*  appearances? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=14.76s)]
*  Do it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=15.76s)]
*  Why is everybody out there talking? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=16.76s)]
*  If you want to move forward, then cancel the media appearances and just take the L and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=18.68s)]
*  just get over it for a while. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=23.92s)]
*  Remember I used to say, why does President Biden never have a cabinet meeting? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=26.4s)]
*  They never met. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  They went nine months without meeting. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=31.56s)]
*  And now you find out that anonymously they were saying they didn't hear from Biden for [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=33.28s)]
*  weeks at a time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=36.96s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg just told the media this week that he didn't see anything wrong with that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, what was Buttigieg doing all the time? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=41.76s)]
*  He was working on his own political brand and not working on things like air traffic [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=44.0s)]
*  control. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Then you have somebody like Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, who could not get [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  into the Oval Office to talk to him about something called inflation and that they had [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=52.92s)]
*  to have talking points written for everybody in order to do that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=57.68s)]
*  I'm beginning to think that Lloyd Austin might have said something to President Biden about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=60.64s)]
*  going into the hospital and that somebody forgot and that he just was a good soldier [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  and said, OK, fine, I'm not going to I'm not going to say anything anymore. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  I made a mistake a couple of years ago and I demanded that Jake Sherman testify. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=74.44s)]
*  Jake Sherman works for Punchbowl News. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=80.76s)]
*  I meant Jake Sullivan. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  And I actually do wonder where the hearings are about this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  You think there should be hearings about a former president? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=89.52s)]
*  Absolutely. So once they pass this big, beautiful bill, Harold, the Democrats are going to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=92.28s)]
*  vote for some will get onto the hearings. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=97.36s)]
*  And if they don't, I'm going to give them a piece of my mind. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=100.08s)]
*  Dana is right. This book by Tapper should have been called Fox was right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  What's really new besides the wheelchair? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=107.12s)]
*  We knew we didn't have cabinet meetings when they did happen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=109.16s)]
*  They were staged. We knew no one saw them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=112.2s)]
*  So why are we talking about this book so much? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=114.76s)]
*  It just confirms everything we knew because people in the inside told Jake, all right, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=116.76s)]
*  this kills every shot Kamala would have had in twenty eight because the cabinet never [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=122.64s)]
*  met her and she's never and him and she's never been asked about any of these revelations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=130.32s)]
*  So the second she gets out there, she's going to get crucified. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=136.2s)]
*  You know what she smells like? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=139.84s)]
*  She smells like cover up. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=141.6s)]
*  She'll never get it off her. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  And for that matter, nobody in the administration who where's my work is working right now, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  Harold, for the Sinaloa cartel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=150.48s)]
*  Where's binder working? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  She was the one saying Biden was running circles around her. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=154.56s)]
*  The whole administration is a disgrace. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  Greg, you've been eloquent about the media should share more blame here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=161.48s)]
*  You still is this continues to be your point? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  Is that some kind of racist comment? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, this is bigger than Watergate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=171.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it is. This makes Watergate look like a parking ticket. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=175.76s)]
*  We don't need to move forward. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=179.44s)]
*  We have to move backwards. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  There was this other tidbit cabinet members believe the president could not be relied on [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  to respond to a crisis at night. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=187.6s)]
*  That means when Biden was president, he was pure 25th Amendment material. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=190.48s)]
*  How do we know this? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  We found out on May 15th, 2025, a year or two, maybe longer after the fact. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=198.4s)]
*  So this book isn't telling on Joe. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=205.16s)]
*  Joe's pathetic and sad. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=206.96s)]
*  It's telling on itself. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=208.36s)]
*  You know, when does information become so urgent that you don't save it for your stupid [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=210.08s)]
*  book? If this were Trump, if any of this information were about Trump, they wouldn't [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=216.64s)]
*  have saved it for a book because he remember. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=221.0s)]
*  While this was happening, Trump wasn't even president and they were saying he was an [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=224.4s)]
*  existential risk. He was a threat to democracy while they were saying Trump was a threat [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=228.44s)]
*  to democracy. They had an incapacitated president that they were covering up for. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=232.96s)]
*  This is it's insane. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=238.36s)]
*  This story is so big that I believe the books are designed to kind of let the air out of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=239.88s)]
*  it and just like, let's get past this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=246.96s)]
*  We can't we can't let them do this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  We can't. This is a this is a huge deal. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=252.44s)]
*  We were lied to. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=256.0s)]
*  Look, did you hear about like they were doing fake cocktail parties for Kamala Harris? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=257.4s)]
*  And get this, because they were worried that she couldn't handle a cocktail party because [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=262.4s)]
*  she drank. We talked about her being drunk all the time. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=266.0s)]
*  They were doing these dry runs because they thought she was an alcoholic. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=268.8s)]
*  And if we made those jokes, oh, my God, she's brilliant and poetic. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, how do you say she's so accomplished? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=276.52s)]
*  No, she's wasted. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=278.32s)]
*  Look at her. Look at her when she talks. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=280.48s)]
*  The cover up would be one thing, but they failed to cover what we all saw. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=283.36s)]
*  And but for Fox News, we would never have seen people crossing the border the way we [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=287.04s)]
*  did. We would never have seen Joe and heard Joe Biden. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=290.48s)]
*  I'm so sick of hearing, had he not run, Kamala would have had more time. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=293.96s)]
*  She didn't lose folks because of racism and sexism. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=297.68s)]
*  She lost because of eyesight and hearing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=300.24s)]
*  She had a different kind of cognitive challenge where she never stepped up into that role. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=302.24s)]
*  If you see the president United States is not being able to perform, if you yourself [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=307.08s)]
*  is his number two, don't have confidence in his competence, you are duty bound [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=311.84s)]
*  constitutionally and practically and politically to step in. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=315.96s)]
*  And because she didn't work hard, they had no faith in that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=319.28s)]
*  By the way, I'm a little tired of hearing about his physical problems. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=323.4s)]
*  That is not the problem here, folks. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  They stood at podiums. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=329.52s)]
*  We don't know what was going on underneath the podium. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=331.36s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=333.52s)]
*  It's a cognitive decline. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=334.68s)]
*  It is the mental capacity to not be able to do the job. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=337.04s)]
*  I'm not letting anything get away with it because they tried to ruin us. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=340.64s)]
*  They tried to ruin our families. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  They tried to. They spent more time on my kids and Hunter friggin Biden. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=345.96s)]
*  Lock them up. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm not, you know, I'm not forgiving any of them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=350.52s)]
*  What about the pardons? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  The 25th Amendment, you mentioned it, Greg, I read it again today. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  I paid a lot of money for that law degree. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=359.0s)]
*  I'm going to use it once in a while. Damn it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=360.52s)]
*  I read it again today. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=362.24s)]
*  It clearly should have been invoked by people who were responsible enough in that party. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=363.36s)]
*  And I have one last question. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=368.6s)]
*  Why would you even want a job you can't handle? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=370.12s)]
*  Why does your family want you in that job? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=372.44s)]
*  Look at Trump. He doesn't need that job. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=374.52000000000004s)]
*  He took that job because he believes in this country and the people believed in him. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=376.32s)]
*  But I would say that, you know, the folks who have covered this up and the journalists [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gK0GBj6svo&t=380.0s)]
