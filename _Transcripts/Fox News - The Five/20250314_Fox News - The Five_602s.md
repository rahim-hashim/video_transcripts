# Gutfeld: This ‘third act’ of the Trump movie can't be forgotten
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM)
*  Donald Trump is going to prison! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=0.0s)]
*  You can't bully the feds themselves. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=4.84s)]
*  He's going to have to plea, or I'm predicting he's going to get charged [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  and very likely will spend time in jail. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=13.72s)]
*  He could end up in prison. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=15.88s)]
*  It doesn't look very good for Donald Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=18.72s)]
*  OK, well that didn't work out well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=21.68s)]
*  One year ago, they tried to take away his freedom. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=24.2s)]
*  But earlier today, President Trump walked through the doors [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=27.56s)]
*  of the DOJ headquarters in Washington, laying down his vision [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=30.6s)]
*  to restore law and order and vowing to end the weaponization [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=34.6s)]
*  of government once and for all. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  We're turning the page on four long years of corruption, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=41.96s)]
*  weaponization and surrender to violent criminals. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=45.96s)]
*  And we're restoring fair, equal and impartial justice [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=48.92s)]
*  under the constitutional rule of law. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=53.36s)]
*  The DOJ and the FBI will once again become the premier [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=56.48s)]
*  crime-fighting agencies on the face of the earth. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  I promised my wife I would never use a bad word, so just a little bad. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  The case against me was bullsh**. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=69.08s)]
*  And she correctly dismissed it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=72.88s)]
*  President Trump also vowing to crack down on violent criminals [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=75.92s)]
*  and the liberal prosecutors who enabled them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=79.56s)]
*  I have no higher mission as president of the United States [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  than to end this killing and stop this law breaking [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=87.4s)]
*  and to making America safe again. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  Instead of having Marxist prosecutors who want to put police officers [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=92.76s)]
*  in handcuffs and go after a police officer rather than a criminal, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=97.2s)]
*  I appointed patriotic tough one crime warriors who will partner [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  with police to put dangerous offenders behind bars, put them in jail. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=105.12s)]
*  You know, Charlie, before I get into the substance of this, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=109.72s)]
*  think about what it was like and how many people tried to prevent [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=114.12s)]
*  former President Donald Trump to become president again [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=120.12s)]
*  and, you know, to put him in jail to make sure that he would never be around again. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=124.4s)]
*  And of course we're seeing why because they, Democrats have completely lost out of, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=131.0s)]
*  run out of any viable issue that connects with voters [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=135.04s)]
*  and even within the Republican Party and when, you know, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=138.76s)]
*  they wanted to keep him from taking over that leadership. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=141.64s)]
*  And it goes back to 2015 when Donald Trump first launched his presidential campaign [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=144.6s)]
*  and at the highest levels of the Obama administration, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=150.67999999999998s)]
*  they made the decision to spy on Donald Trump and his campaign. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=153.72s)]
*  And from their perspective, it worked because they maintained [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=158.76s)]
*  that throughout the entire first term, the entire political press, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=164.64s)]
*  the media in Washington focused entirely on the proceeds of that spying on his campaign, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  done again at the highest level of the Obama administration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  And it defined his first term. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=181.48s)]
*  And then, of course, you know, it got him out of the White House by 2020. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  He was impeached twice on idiotic, fake, made up things. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=187.27999999999997s)]
*  And then why wouldn't they keep pursuing it? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  It worked for them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=194.83999999999997s)]
*  And so then they spent the next four years pursuing the exact same strategy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=195.92s)]
*  And in the end, it obviously, you know, because he is the tough guy that he is, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=200.2s)]
*  he managed to come out, he managed to beat them, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=205.32s)]
*  and they are left with absolutely nothing except crying [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=208.83999999999997s)]
*  because he walked down to DOJ and gave a speech today. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  You know, the truth is, Katie, that the president indicated [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=217.2s)]
*  that he was going to end the weaponization and the politicization of the Department of Justice. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=222.44s)]
*  But is that enough? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=228.72s)]
*  Because as Charlie just referenced, Jim Comey signing unverified affidavits, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=229.92s)]
*  going before the FISA court, going again, re-upping his spying, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=236.48s)]
*  does there have to be more consequence? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=241.28s)]
*  I would argue that the weaponization went back to 2010 during the Tea Party movement, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=243.68s)]
*  when the IRS and Department of Justice worked together to go after conservative grassroots activists [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  with the power of the Justice Department and the federal government under Barack Obama. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  They got away with it. There's no accountability. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  So then they moved into 2015 and did even more illegal activity in spying against the Trump campaign, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=259.76s)]
*  moved that through his first presidency. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=266.48s)]
*  And there's a big difference to answer your question between retaliation, weaponization, and accountability. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=268.72s)]
*  And when he goes to DOJ today and talks about how he's getting out these prosecutors who are engaged in this behavior, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=275.32s)]
*  it's because he doesn't want this to continue on. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=280.44s)]
*  They're holding people accountable for what happened because this is such a stain on the American system of justice. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=282.68s)]
*  We should be the crown jewel of the entire world in terms of fairness. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=289.48s)]
*  That's why we're different than the rest of the world. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=294.32s)]
*  We're not supposed to have King of Rue courts or Banana Republic style justice. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=296.52s)]
*  We're supposed to have real justice. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=301.08s)]
*  And that was completely destroyed over the course of the past four years under Biden and during the Obama administration. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=302.88s)]
*  So accountability is a very different thing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=309.64s)]
*  One thing I also love that he said was that he is back in Washington now and he wants the capital of America to be clean and safe. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=311.52s)]
*  It belongs to all Americans. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=319.84s)]
*  And I don't think that we should discredit how much that actually means in terms of the pride of the country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=321.48s)]
*  Well, you know what, it's not only pride, Harold, but it's the broken windows theory. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, the more this kind of low level crime, whether it's graffiti or anything else, it kind of have this aura of lawlessness. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=331.44s)]
*  But reorienting the Department of Justice to its main mission, which is the prosecution of crime, is a good thing, don't you think? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=338.92s)]
*  I do. I have no issue with the president going over to the Justice Department today [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=346.56s)]
*  and laying out what he laid out. I do take a little umbrage at the I'm just different in how I accept and how I gloat about a win. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=350.88s)]
*  He won everything you said, Charles, and everything that Katie said. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=360.84s)]
*  The real display of power and confidence, the real jury spoke in November and returned him to the White House after all of these things, whatever whatever it is you want to say to. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=365.76s)]
*  I don't like the personal stuff. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=377.24s)]
*  I agree with the president in this regard. There are things that the criminal division, the way they go about pursuing prosecutions at the Justice Department that shouldn't be changed just because of President Trump. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  There are a number of Americans who don't have the resources, certainly don't have the the kind of the determination that this president had to fight those things in order that they have the political support this president had. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=388.52s)]
*  And they have been prosecuted by the Justice Department. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=399.12s)]
*  They should reform the way the criminal division and other divisions that the Justice Department goes about conducting their business, not just making it about President Trump, because the ultimate told you so was him winning in November. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=401.88s)]
*  And I salute him, applaud him for that. I just wish he didn't make it so personal all of the time. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=413.84s)]
*  You know, Greg, I'm glad he made it personal because nobody, of course, nobody, of course, has been has been faced with the kind of targeted, vicious, unjustified prosecutions [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  that the Democrats engaged in. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=431.64s)]
*  I am so disgusted by what Harold said. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, this isn't about winning, Harold. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=437.88s)]
*  It's about imprinting the memory of this event on history, because as we know, history is always rewritten by the losers. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=439.44s)]
*  We know the history. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=449.88s)]
*  If you think media is fake, what do you think about the people? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  Where do you think the historians came from? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  They came from media. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=457.28s)]
*  So we have to. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=458.56s)]
*  No one else is going to do this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=460.12s)]
*  He has to do it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=461.76s)]
*  We have to do it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=463.24s)]
*  What you don't hear right now. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=464.4s)]
*  What's that silence? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=466.8s)]
*  It's all the people in the media who tried to take him out. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=467.68s)]
*  They aren't saying, oh, we were wrong. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=470.12s)]
*  Oh, whoopsie daisy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=472.76s)]
*  Biden has dementia. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=474.48s)]
*  They are doing that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=477.76s)]
*  So we have to. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=479.36s)]
*  They've disappeared. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=480.8s)]
*  They've gone away. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  How is this not a fable for the ages, an inspirational lesson to everyone who has felt targeted in their lives, who felt felt outgunned and outnumbered? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=482.8s)]
*  If this were a Democrat, there would already be 12 movies made about this man. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  The most consequential political triumph in American history and Hollywood and media are staying home in their pajamas, weeping into their funions. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=499.68s)]
*  And so that's why we have to do this. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=510.2s)]
*  It's not like it's not gloating. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=511.92s)]
*  It's a reminder that this third act of this Trump movie cannot be forgotten. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=514.12s)]
*  If there was justice, we should be able to parade every hack on TV from the morning Joe's to the Daily Show guy on camera. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=520.88s)]
*  And they literally, literally, I don't mean metaphorically, they have to eat their words. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  We actually take their words verbatim. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=535.0s)]
*  We bake cookies and we write their words on the cookies and then they have to sit down. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=537.2s)]
*  We it's it's not even pay per view. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=542.4s)]
*  It's free. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=544.84s)]
*  And we just force them to eat their words, every single word. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=546.08s)]
*  But what if they like their cookies? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=551.76s)]
*  Well, that might happen with Stelter. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=553.84s)]
*  But why not reform the Justice Department for everybody? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=556.72s)]
*  Well, OK, OK, OK. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=559.08s)]
*  Can I respond to that? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=560.4s)]
*  You saw two things going on there. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=562.6s)]
*  One was the personal justice Trump, but he also was talking about American justice. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  So, well, he's focused the attention on illegal immigration, on crime, on ending foreign wars. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=568.92s)]
*  He has taken the concern, the boutique white liberal concerns of race, identity and trans, and he's put it on the things that benefit everybody. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SpNlrZPeYM&t=574.9599999999999s)]
