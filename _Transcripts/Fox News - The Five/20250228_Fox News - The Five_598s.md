# 'The Five' analyzes the heated Oval Office spat between Trump and Zelenskyy
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4)
*  We have a Fox News alert. President Trump is speaking to reporters right now, saying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=0.0s)]
*  Zelensky overplayed his hand and that Ukrainian president wants to fight, fight, fight. We [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=4.44s)]
*  will bring you that video when we have it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=9.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, the media had a field day today. Watch this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=11.68s)]
*  Never in the history of modern diplomacy, war, peace, whatever, have I ever, ever, ever [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=15.76s)]
*  seen anything like this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=24.04s)]
*  This was a tragedy. This doesn't make the American people better off tomorrow. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=25.5s)]
*  This is a catastrophe. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=30.0s)]
*  The president of the United States is a coward who is Vladimir Putin's puppet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=32.88s)]
*  It seemed as though, you know, Vladimir Putin's work was being done for him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=38.16s)]
*  Trump become a lapdog for a brutal dictator in Moscow. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=43.32s)]
*  The propaganda is what's coming out of J.D. Vance's mouth, and it's Russian propaganda. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=48.0s)]
*  Which side of this war is Donald Trump on? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=52.0s)]
*  Putin and his cronies are probably popping champagne bottles right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=54.84s)]
*  So, Sandra, you know, it's kind of odd considering what we've been through over the last [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=60.96s)]
*  couple of years. But given what we saw today, is it do you think it's the best strategy [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=65.24s)]
*  for Democrats to go back to the playbook of, oh, Trump is a Putin stooge? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=71.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's going to work. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=78.08s)]
*  And the fact that the American public was able to see every bit of this happening in the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=79.84s)]
*  Oval Office, they'll be able to decide for themselves. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=84.64s)]
*  And so it behooved the press to cover this fairly and from all sides. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  Just looking at some of what we're hearing from President Trump as he is departing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=90.64s)]
*  And remember, we're going to hear from Zelensky a short time from now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=93.96s)]
*  And that sit down with Brett. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=96.64s)]
*  It sounds like Trump is making sure that his intentions are known. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=98.0s)]
*  Some of what we are hearing is what you would expect. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=103.64s)]
*  We are looking for peace, not a 10 year war. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  He says Zelensky wants to fight, fight, fight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=109.96s)]
*  I think that's what people saw him doing in the Oval Office. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=112.16s)]
*  Trump says the U.S. is not looking to play games. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=115.76s)]
*  Clearly, when you see that exchange with the president of the United States, he sat down [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=118.36s)]
*  for a deal. He did not come to play games. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=123.16s)]
*  So the fact that this so publicly played out on the global stage, there's going to there [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=126.32s)]
*  are going to be strong opinions on what this means for world leaders to have seen this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=131.48s)]
*  play out. But certainly for the American public to see this play out and then see the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=136.32s)]
*  reaction from the media. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=140.52s)]
*  What if what if this meeting had taken place and just simply a statement came out or we [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  learned that Zelensky got kicked out? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  You can only imagine the speculation, but people saw exactly what happened there and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  they can decide for themselves. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  I think the diplomatic words are frank. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  They had a frank discussion. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  That's all we would have gotten out of it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=157.48s)]
*  So, Jesse, like one of the things that I love about this is that beforehand, Zelensky [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=158.92s)]
*  met with a bunch of members of Congress to like prep for the meeting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  What do you think those phone calls were like when he walked out of the meeting and he [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=167.11999999999998s)]
*  called those guys back and he's like, so how did I do? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=170.48s)]
*  He used to have to get prepped by Biden officials before getting on the phone with Joe [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=173.6s)]
*  because he'd get on the phone with Joe and make endless demands and never say thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=178.92s)]
*  And it drove Joe crazy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  And the same thing is happening here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  I have a lot of respect for Zelensky. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  He's a brave guy. His people are brave, but he's got no leverage anymore. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=190.28s)]
*  The only leverage he has are minerals and he doesn't even know how to use that leverage. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  He'll never be a NATO member. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=198.72s)]
*  It's not in our interest for him to be a NATO member. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=200.24s)]
*  And the fact that he was arguing with the president of the United States and the vice [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=203.4s)]
*  president in front of cameras in the Oval Office showed so much disrespect. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=207.32s)]
*  And he's like a freshman out there when you think about it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=213.28s)]
*  He doesn't really know what's happening. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=216.8s)]
*  This war just hit him in the face and he's trying to survive. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=218.44s)]
*  The things the Democrats are saying, Putin, puppet, these things are just slogans. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=221.16s)]
*  What is the Democrat strategy to win the war? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  Or end the war? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=230.64s)]
*  They don't have one because the Democrat strategy is to make this an endless proxy [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=232.96s)]
*  war that goes on forever. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=238.28s)]
*  An unwinnable proxy war. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=240.72s)]
*  World War One trench warfare style where the Russians gain a half a mile a week and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=243.24s)]
*  they just run out of ammunition. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=249.44s)]
*  That's unsustainable. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=252.64s)]
*  What is the national interest in fighting an unwinnable endless proxy war? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=254.28s)]
*  Which is the Democrat strategy? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=258.4s)]
*  No one's ever explained it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=260.56s)]
*  I can see the U.S. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  interest in ending the war. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=263.32000000000005s)]
*  We get mineral rights, energy and commodity prices go down. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=265.12s)]
*  We could maybe add to our munitions, which have been spent over the last three years. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  You peel Russia away from China a little bit. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  I could go on and on. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=276.48s)]
*  But sometimes, as you and all know, you have to break up to make up. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  And these things happen. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=283.12s)]
*  Deals get blown up and they get cobbled back together. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure next week they'll sign something. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=287.32000000000005s)]
*  Jesse has a point. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, what is the Democrat strategy for just ending the war? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=291.8s)]
*  Well, you've heard from a lot more Democrats recently that they understand that there [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  could be some concessions, that we're not going to get back to the pre 2014 lines. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  Even Zelensky has talked about him understanding that that might happen. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=305.56s)]
*  And again, I'll repeat that he said, I will step down for being the leader of this [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  country. I think I have 57 percent approval rating. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=313.72s)]
*  People are pretty fond of him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=317.12s)]
*  We know that wartime presidents don't have elections. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=318.2s)]
*  Just putting it out there. He said, I'll do what I can to make a peace deal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=321.24s)]
*  But what they're signaling in this and what Zelensky is signaling with his attitude [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=325.64s)]
*  is something that the leader of the CDU won the German elections. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=330.88s)]
*  MERS, who will become the next chancellor, was talking about that Europe is on its own [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=335.36s)]
*  with Ukraine now, that they do not feel that they have a partner in the U.S. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=340.08s)]
*  who's going to be protecting and supporting Ukraine or them going forward, and that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=343.84s)]
*  Donald Trump has aligned himself more with Vladimir Putin than with the traditional [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=348.76s)]
*  Western world order, that the alliances in the post World War Two world are over and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=353.88s)]
*  that he likes Vladimir Putin better. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=361.44s)]
*  I don't know. I understand you want to make a deal. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=363.28s)]
*  And by the way, this deal doesn't seem like it had a lot for the Ukrainians. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=365.4s)]
*  If what he wants is security. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=368.28s)]
*  Germany is Russia's biggest customer. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  All they do is buy energy from Russia and they didn't give a lot of weaponry to the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=373.24s)]
*  Ukrainians, not nearly as much as we did. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=378.12s)]
*  The Germans sat this one out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=380.2s)]
*  Same with the French. The British and the Americans did the heavy lifting. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  As a percentage of GDP, we rank 17th in terms of how much we've given them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=385.0s)]
*  That percentage, shermanage, is a lot of money. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=390.12s)]
*  Yes, of course. We're richer. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=393.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter, Jessica. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=395.16s)]
*  We armed them to the teeth and they did a hell of a job stopping the Russian war machine. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=396.6s)]
*  But now it's time to end the war. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  It is not just Democrats that are critical of this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=403.6s)]
*  Noted Democrat Karl Rove was on earlier talking about it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  John Bolton, I get it, doesn't like Trump anymore. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  But this guy, traditional conservative person, who's saying that this is a huge [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=413.12s)]
*  nightmare for the future. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=418.36s)]
*  Lindsey Graham said kick him out. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=420.2s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, who we all know, never saw a war, didn't want to fight, said [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=421.6s)]
*  Zelensky, get out of town, you screwed the pooch. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=426.44s)]
*  Or a war that he wanted somebody else to fight. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=429.08000000000004s)]
*  No, but the problem here is that this idea that somehow Trump likes Putin more than [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=431.92s)]
*  Zelensky is absurd to me. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=437.2s)]
*  The idea of this minerals deal hooks the United States deeply into the interests of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine. Emily, in terms of the Democrat strategy for messaging this, are they winning [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=444.48s)]
*  or are they losing? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, I personally think they are not winning and that they never are. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  Look, I'll say this. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=458.36s)]
*  At the end of the day, what we are looking at is peace through strength. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  Earlier in the meeting, President Trump said that he is continuing to send arms. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=462.76s)]
*  But as he quoted, he said, but not too much more aid would be forthcoming. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=466.72s)]
*  We're not looking forward to it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  We're looking forward to getting the war finished so we can do other things. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=472.72s)]
*  So respectfully, as well as people like Christiane Amanpour, who says she's never [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=475.52s)]
*  seen anything like this, it's because she's never had the honor of being in the room [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=478.72s)]
*  behind closed doors without the press there when this is what diplomacy looks like. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=482.92s)]
*  Right. Taking out root canals and coming to agreements with the different alignments [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=487.36s)]
*  and different values is not always pretty. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=491.12s)]
*  And that's confirmed by Secretary Pompeo, who earlier on our network shared, look, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=493.48s)]
*  he's seen this all the time. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=497.56s)]
*  He's just never seen it before in front of the cameras. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=498.76000000000005s)]
*  And for people who pundits who come on on air and say they call President Trump a [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=501.32000000000005s)]
*  coward and a puppet. Well, is that what Biden was then in October of twenty twenty [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  two, who on his call with Zelensky, as the Wall Street Journal and CNN reported, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=509.12s)]
*  yelled at him, told him he wasn't thanking him enough. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=513.0400000000001s)]
*  He didn't feel gratitude. He was simply wanting to take more. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=516.12s)]
*  Is that what they called Biden back then? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=518.64s)]
*  At the end of the day, what we are seeing is a second term president, President Trump, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=520.68s)]
*  who is in the art of the deal negotiating what that looks like, which is not the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=524.64s)]
*  World War Two Axis allied nations. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=528.32s)]
*  It's far more complicated than that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=530.72s)]
*  And it involves acquiescing in part to achieve mutually beneficial agreements. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=532.68s)]
*  That means we don't simply ice out Russia and China, because obviously that's not [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=538.04s)]
*  doable anymore. The embedness of all of these [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=542.6800000000001s)]
*  countries economically, intellectually and so many property in so many different [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=545.92s)]
*  ways, you cannot simply excise a tumor and think it's the end of the day. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  So in my opinion, for those in the Democrat Party who are crowing about what do they [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  want, a long term, an endless war? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=557.64s)]
*  We want another Afghanistan. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=559.52s)]
*  We left our blood and treasure there on the field. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=561.16s)]
*  There are still French cranes in Iraq. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=563.24s)]
*  So for me, this is the goal for peace. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=565.3199999999999s)]
*  This is the objective and the end result to peace. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=568.88s)]
*  And as President Trump said, I don't want an advantage. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  I want peace. And I wish the Democrat Party would listen to our commander in chief and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=573.64s)]
*  know that this is what that looks like. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=577.24s)]
*  It is truly extraordinary to think about every single advancement Putin has made has [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=579.08s)]
*  been made under Democrat leadership. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=583.28s)]
*  And now they're accusing Trump of being in bed with Putin. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0cs_LaGw4&t=585.0s)]
