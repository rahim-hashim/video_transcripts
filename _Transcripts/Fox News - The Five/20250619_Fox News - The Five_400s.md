# ‘The Five’ break down 'daily Dem dumpster fire'
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws)
*  If it's another day, you can bet it's another dumpster fire for the Democrats. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=0.0s)]
*  Sorry, Jess. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  According to the New York Times, the DNC is in chaos and desperate for cash. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Things are so bad, top officials are actually talking about borrowing money just to pay [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=9.64s)]
*  the bills. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=13.92s)]
*  A separate report quotes an anonymous DNC insider who called the party's chair, Ken [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=14.92s)]
*  Martin, as looking weak and whiny. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=19.84s)]
*  And as if all that were not embarrassing enough, the Democrats launched a YouTube channel that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=23.96s)]
*  can barely crack a thousand views. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=30.959999999999997s)]
*  Every morning, the Daily Blueprint will cut through the noise and give you the real story. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  What you need to know today, what Democrats are doing about it and how you can fight back [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=37.44s)]
*  and help Democrats win. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=41.44s)]
*  But some folks in the party like James Carville are keeping the faith. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=44.84s)]
*  Democratic Party has been the most effective political party in the history of the world. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=50.56s)]
*  It started Social Security. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=55.42s)]
*  It brought civil rights. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=56.76s)]
*  It brought women's rights. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=57.96s)]
*  It brought gay rights. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=58.96s)]
*  It brought the last party to bring a balanced budget to the United States of America. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=59.96s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=64.32s)]
*  It shepherded the United States through the greatest age of prosperity it ever had in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=65.32s)]
*  the 90s. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  The Democratic Party really does not need me to defend it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  It has a record. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=73.52s)]
*  Oh, it does. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=74.52s)]
*  It does. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=75.52s)]
*  As good as you can imagine. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=76.52s)]
*  I'm not sure if Carville is the answer here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=77.52s)]
*  Dana, let me come to you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=80.68s)]
*  You know this ecosystem better than anybody, the D.C. funding ecosystem here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=82.2s)]
*  When you make it this, they've never had trouble raising money before. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=87.0s)]
*  It's the Democrats' McGilla. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  I've tried to use it in a sentence. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it was correct. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=94.32s)]
*  For James Carville to be talking about the best achievements of the party, having been [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  made before the current chairman was even born, that identifies the problem right there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=99.44s)]
*  Every day I wake up and I think, what can I compliment in the Democratic Party today? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=104.84s)]
*  What are the green shoots? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=108.8s)]
*  Where are they doing well? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=109.8s)]
*  And then I read, and I didn't read this article today on FoxNews.com. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=110.84s)]
*  I didn't read it in the Wall Street Journal or the New York Post. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  I read it in the New York Times because the New York Times said, you've got a huge problem. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=117.44s)]
*  You can't raise any money. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=120.78s)]
*  Nobody wants to be a part of you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=122.22s)]
*  Your brand is toxic. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=124.22s)]
*  And you have the fact that the Biden cover-up continues to have a ripple effect. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=126.06s)]
*  It's like it was dropped in the middle of the ocean and it continues on and it is going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=130.18s)]
*  to swamp them for a long time to come. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=134.1s)]
*  The credibility of the entire Kamala Harris campaign is weighing down the situation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=136.9s)]
*  And imagine you're a donor. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=141.62s)]
*  He's like, how dare you? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=142.62s)]
*  You want to send George Clooney to ask me for my money again? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=144.58s)]
*  You guys lied to us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=147.18s)]
*  You lied to us until we saw with our own eyes at the debate. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=148.52s)]
*  And then you're like, oh, yeah, he must really get out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=151.3s)]
*  And they're in a situation of their own making. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  It is a real McGill-a. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=156.62s)]
*  And, you know, they paid Beyonce all that money and everything else. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=157.62s)]
*  So Jess, I got to come to you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=160.66s)]
*  I mean, in a lot of ways, the money is the purest metric you could have. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=162.18s)]
*  Is this a referendum? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=166.02s)]
*  To some degree, for sure. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=167.66s)]
*  What I think is most interesting is they're not having a small dollar donations problem. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=168.94s)]
*  So the grassroots is still giving. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=172.94s)]
*  They're having a big donor problem, to Dana's point. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=174.78s)]
*  The folks that you go to and you ask for million dollar checks or to do a huge fundraiser that's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  going to bring in five, 10, 15 million dollars. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=181.22s)]
*  And I think that those people who want to spend their hard earned money on Democratic [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=184.1s)]
*  victories want to see a new game plan. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=189.66s)]
*  They want to see what all the buzz is about with Ken Martin, who's the new head of the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=192.32s)]
*  DNC, who beat out Ben Wickler as an incredibly accomplished organizer. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=196.26s)]
*  He runs the Wisconsin Democratic Party. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=199.98s)]
*  And they want to see more evidence. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=202.74s)]
*  Now, in terms of how it's been going for Democrats, we've been doing really well in all the elections [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=204.62s)]
*  that have happened since the general election. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=210.02s)]
*  So overperforming sometimes by 30, 40 points. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=212.9s)]
*  And that makes a difference to people for sure. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=216.5s)]
*  We're also looking at a Republican Party that's not doing that well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=218.5s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump right now minus 18 on the economy, minus 30 on inflation. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=222.46s)]
*  Those are the issues that people go and vote on. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  In defense of the YouTube, I went on the GOP's YouTube. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=229.56s)]
*  Latest videos, 215 views, 137 views, 433 views, 281 views and 250 views. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=234.52s)]
*  So both parties need a better YouTube game. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=243.16s)]
*  All right, fair enough. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=245.84s)]
*  But let me ask you this, Jesse, let me come to you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=246.94s)]
*  What is it that you think the big donors, which is what we're talking about here, what [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=248.88s)]
*  brings them back? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=252.0s)]
*  What are they looking for? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=253.0s)]
*  I'd wait. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=254.0s)]
*  I wouldn't give right now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=255.04s)]
*  I'd wait until you win the midterms and then I'd give it to Gavin Newsom because you can't [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=256.32s)]
*  give it to a woman. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=261.04s)]
*  They're over two with women. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=262.04s)]
*  And Jessica, it doesn't matter. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=264.02s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=266.0s)]
*  No, you should be ahead of the finances. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah, in your house, do they? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=269.52s)]
*  That's why you're broke. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=271.24s)]
*  You know, the YouTube thing, it's funny. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=273.6s)]
*  You can't just put a blonde on TV and have it be a hit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=274.92s)]
*  It's not Fox. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=277.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=278.48s)]
*  They need to have a little more talent, Jessica. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=279.48s)]
*  And Carville's saying the Democratic Party started the Civil War. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=281.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not all hits, Carville. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  You have to be a DNC chairman if you have to be wealthy, well-connected and fun at fundraisers. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  You need someone like Terry McAuliffe. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=297.24s)]
*  You can't put Shaggy from Scooby-Doo up there, who got humiliated by The Hog, who looks like [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=299.5s)]
*  Tinkerbell or weighs less than Tinkerbell. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=307.0s)]
*  And so, I don't know, Jessica, I would just wait it out. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=310.24s)]
*  And you might not even win the House because I have a new poll. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  It says there are crumbs of comfort for the GOP, not saying Red Wave, but a lot of people [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=316.24s)]
*  are saying the short-term turbulence that Trump is saying is going to be worth it if [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=323.32s)]
*  it ends up good economically. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=327.64s)]
*  And a lot of Democrats are economic nationalists, just like Donald Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=329.72s)]
*  They support deportations. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=333.7s)]
*  They support Trump on immigration. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=335.24s)]
*  Catch this. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=337.04s)]
*  Are you reading Playbook? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=338.04s)]
*  A quarter of Kamala Harris' voters approve of Trump's immigration policy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=339.04s)]
*  Oh my. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=343.8s)]

*  Greg Gutfeld, let me ask you this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=348.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  I have a theory here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=350.84000000000003s)]

*  Spit it out. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH3y2MH9xws&t=356.20000000000005s)]
