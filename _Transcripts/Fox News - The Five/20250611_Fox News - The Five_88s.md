# Dems fracture over immigration issue amid LA riots #shorts #foxnews #usa #us #news
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc)
*  Democrats are once again blowing it on another 80-20 issue by sticking up for the rights of illegals to burn down the cities they invaded. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=0.0s)]
*  Prosecutors announcing federal charges against two agitators, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=7.94s)]
*  one of them is an illegal immigrant for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers during the protests in LA. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  CNN's Data Guy delivering the bad news for the Democrats on how legal migrants side with Trump and the GOP big leap. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=18.68s)]
*  Look at that shift, a 40-point shift to the right among immigrant voters. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=26.28s)]
*  Republicans now lead on this issue by eight points over Democrats more so than any other group [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=32.68s)]
*  that I could find the group of voters who became more hawkish on immigration were in fact immigrants themselves, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=38.68s)]
*  immigrants who are registered to vote in this country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=45.32s)]
*  Right on cue, Senator John Fetterman, the lone voice of reason, telling his own party the basics. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=48.72s)]
*  Don't burn stuff, don't loot, don't attack cops, but AOC's got her earmuffs on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  You can't defend when people start setting things on fire or they start damaging buildings or going after members of law enforcement. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=58.8s)]
*  That's not free speech. That is not peaceful protest. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=67.32s)]
*  If Senator Fetterman or anybody else is concerned with law and order, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=74.12s)]
*  we should be looking at one of the most law-breaking agencies and administrations that we've seen in the United States. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4J1IuyJZc&t=78.84s)]
