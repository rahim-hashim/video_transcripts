# 'The Five' roasts the left's attacks on ICE
**Fox News - The Five:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw)
*  President Trump chewing out the Dems for making a stink out of ICE agents wearing masks, even [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=0.0s)]
*  though there's a pretty good reason to cover up. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=8.36s)]
*  Immigration officials face a nearly 700% surge in assaults on personnel, and those Trantifa [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=11.08s)]
*  thugs land death traps. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=17.8s)]
*  That is sort of funny when people picket in front of Columbia, in front of Harvard, and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=20.92s)]
*  they have masks on, more than masks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=24.96s)]
*  I mean, you can't see anything. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=27.28s)]
*  Nobody complains about that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=29.32s)]
*  But when a patriot who works for ICE or Border Patrol puts a mask on so that they won't recognize [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=31.32s)]
*  him and his family, there's a problem with that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=40.56s)]
*  What do you think the penalty should be for these people who are — if they are found [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=43.32s)]
*  guilty — [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=47.8s)]
*  Very stiff. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=48.8s)]
*  — for people who shoot at ICE officers? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=49.8s)]
*  Very, very stiff. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=51.36s)]
*  Very stiff. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  A long time in jail. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=54.88s)]
*  A long time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=58.12s)]
*  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and LA Mayor Karen Bass making it a point of pride that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=59.64s)]
*  their cities won't cooperate with ICE. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  Look, we are welcoming city ordinance. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  Our local police department will not ever cooperate with ICE, whatever their constitutional [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=70.08s)]
*  authority is. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=84.64s)]
*  They're going to arrest me for doing my job? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=85.76s)]
*  I mean, as mayor, my number one responsibility is to keep Angelino safe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=88.2s)]
*  Now, it never dawned on me that I would have to worry about keeping Angelino safe from [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=93.44s)]
*  my own government. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=97.92s)]
*  And the media is constantly brainwashing their base by accusing ICE agents of terrorizing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=98.92s)]
*  communities. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=104.68s)]
*  It would seem that the invasion into American cities is coming from law enforcement deployed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  by this administration to terrorize communities. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=113.68s)]
*  Am I getting that right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=117.76s)]
*  What's terrorizing Americans are friends and neighbors otherwise known as immigrants. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=118.76s)]
*  They are not going after criminals. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=124.2s)]
*  They're going after anybody that is brown, that looks like me. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  All right, Jesse. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  So ICE's job is to protect our border, our sovereignty. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  So aren't attacks on them a daily insurrection, one in which they are actually armed and dangerous? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=135.24s)]
*  Why aren't the Democrats noticing that? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=142.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was traitorous to let him into the country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=144.04s)]
*  And now they're attacking the people that are trying to catch him and remove him. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=146.72s)]
*  People understand the right to privacy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=150.72s)]
*  And the Democrats talk about the right to privacy all the time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  And that can be used in different ways. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=157.08s)]
*  Harold tints his windows in his car. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't want to see, have everybody see. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=162.12s)]
*  Or people put their businesses in shell companies. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=164.68s)]
*  Hunter had about 30. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=167.44s)]
*  I tried to put my home in an LLC and I screwed it up and now everybody knows where I live. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=169.12s)]
*  But 1317 Snow Drip Lane. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=175.36s)]
*  I wish. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=177.72s)]
*  It's a good neighborhood. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=179.24s)]
*  But you know, these people, besides, I don't know, actors, anchors, politicians and athletes, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=181.4s)]
*  they don't like people filming them at work. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=188.68s)]
*  If people went around just filming everybody else at work, they would wear masks too. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=191.4s)]
*  And these guys are wearing masks because cartels and Trantifa are putting hits out on them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=196.4s)]
*  It's called discretion. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=201.6s)]
*  Swalwell should know something about that after that spy incident. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=202.84s)]
*  Now Johnson doesn't want deportations because 15 percent of the population in Chicago is [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  illegal aliens. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=213.08s)]
*  And donors run Johnson. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  And the donors who own the trucking companies, the commercial real estate, they need these [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=217.12s)]
*  guys because they pay them slave wages. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=221.36s)]
*  And they don't have any insurance. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=224.6s)]
*  Like these illegals get hurt on the job. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=226.0s)]
*  They're expendable. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=227.88s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=228.88s)]
*  And the landlords love them because it drives up rent. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=229.88s)]
*  The insurance executives love them because it drives up rates. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=232.24s)]
*  The people who don't like them are the poor and middle class black, white and Hispanic [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=235.32s)]
*  workers because it crowds the schools, it crowds the apartments, it crowds the hospitals [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=239.84s)]
*  and it crowds the streets. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=244.2s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have seen this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=245.84s)]
*  People are showing what Google Maps looks like in LA now that all the illegals are hiding [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=247.4s)]
*  from ICE. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=251.72s)]
*  There's no traffic on the freeway. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=253.28s)]
*  You can go on the 405 and you go 65 miles an hour. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=255.56s)]
*  Trump has literally reduced traffic in Los Angeles and Democrats are complaining. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=259.88s)]
*  Well, I didn't see that one coming, Harold. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=265.72s)]
*  You know, good to see you, Harold, as always. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=268.28s)]
*  I lie. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=270.84s)]
*  Here you have Trump once again dealing with a massive problem, mass illegal immigration. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=271.84s)]
*  And the Dems always do this and I think you agree with me. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=277.6s)]
*  They avoid practical solution and instead they dance on the edge of process. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=280.76s)]
*  They focus on like irrelevant details, pronouns, masks, tweets instead of crime, education, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=285.9s)]
*  the economy. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=293.36s)]
*  This seems to be a pattern. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=294.36s)]
*  They can't solve any problems so they plant themselves on this irrelevant stuff like masks. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=296.12s)]
*  How do you explain this? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  I agree with you that first, good to be back with you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  The mask thing, I think you, one of the things you said a lot there in the opening, Jesse, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=305.0s)]
*  I think one of the things I fully agree with is that this is this is security and protection [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=309.32s)]
*  for these law enforcement officials. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=313.92s)]
*  I condemn all violence and I agree with the president in a big way that harsh penalties [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=315.52s)]
*  should go to anyone who commits violence against a law enforcement official or a political [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=319.36s)]
*  official. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=323.8s)]
*  Now, here's where I differ with him a little bit. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=324.8s)]
*  When he started, we had a conversation about this yesterday about the things we're doing [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=327.76s)]
*  in terms of deporting people in this country. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=331.26s)]
*  Mr. Holman said from the outset that the worst were going to be the first that we deported [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=333.24s)]
*  and appears in the first 75 to 90 days of the Trump administration. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=337.62s)]
*  They were doing more of that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=342.1s)]
*  They were not doing it at a rate that I think we may have quoted a number yesterday in the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=343.46s)]
*  high 70s or 80 percent. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=348.1s)]
*  There was about 50 percent of the people from the first 90 days were violent criminals. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=349.1s)]
*  Now, my source for this are two C organizations, CBS News, which some may have a feeling about [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=353.62s)]
*  their politics and the Cato Institute, but some may have a position about their politics. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=358.74s)]
*  It says of June 14th, ICE had booked into detention 204,000 individuals. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=362.98s)]
*  Of those bookings, 65 percent had no criminal convictions. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=367.3s)]
*  Moreover, more than 93 percent of ICE bookings were never convicted of any violent offenses. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=370.74s)]
*  We should figure out what they mean by violent by that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=375.18s)]
*  I wish that the mayors and the governors in these states, where they're blue states or [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  red states, but particularly blue states, would sit down with the president and sit [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=381.66s)]
*  down with Tom Holman. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=384.82s)]
*  The lack of coordination between the two, these three government agencies or levels [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=385.82s)]
*  of government is causing a lot of this and is triggering a lot of this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=389.68s)]
*  Those should know, whether you're Democrat or Republican, if you commit a crime against [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  a law enforcement official, regardless of how much you believe you're right, you should [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  go to jail for a very, very long time. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=403.52s)]
*  I hope the president and all the things he's doing, I hope he enacts that and I hope he [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=405.32s)]
*  gets back to sending the worst out of this country first. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=409.0s)]
*  So Dana, my head exploded while listening to Karen Bass talking about how her job doing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=414.76s)]
*  mayor, keeping her citizens safe. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=421.76s)]
*  Right now, just five percent of the 900 rebuild permits in Altadena alone have been approved. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=424.48s)]
*  They're not rebuilding in LA. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=430.68s)]
*  She wasn't even there during the fires. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=431.96s)]
*  How can anybody take that bozo seriously? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  She said, it never occurred to me that I would have to protect Angelino's from our federal [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=436.12s)]
*  government. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=439.64s)]
*  Like, well, it never occurred to them that you would leave and go to Africa on a junket [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=440.64s)]
*  while there was a major fire danger and not checking in on those reservoirs. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=444.9s)]
*  She said, Brandon says, whatever their constitutional authority, it doesn't matter. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=451.32s)]
*  So he said, we are never going to cooperate with ICE, no matter their constitutional authority. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=457.52s)]
*  OK, let's go back. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=463.52s)]
*  Let's review. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=465.0s)]
*  What did we hear all of last year from the Democrats was that Trump was the existential [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=466.0s)]
*  crisis. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=469.88s)]
*  He was going to be the end of our democracy. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=470.88s)]
*  He was going to run roughshod over the Constitution. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=472.64s)]
*  However, what happened yesterday? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=475.24s)]
*  President Trump wants to fire some people in the federal government. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  He was filed, goes up through the process. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=481.12s)]
*  The Supreme Court votes seven to two that he is allowed to do it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=483.08s)]
*  OK, so he has a policy preference. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=487.68s)]
*  He's gone through the constitutional process. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=490.16s)]
*  The highest court in the lands that he could do it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=492.04s)]
*  That is following the Constitution. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=494.2s)]
*  What they're suggesting is not. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=496.56s)]
*  The last thing I would say is leadership abhors a vacuum. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=497.8s)]
*  And this was asked of Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat leader in the House. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=502.56s)]
*  Wolf Blitzer asked him, there needs to be blood, is the quote. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=507.72s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=510.92s)]
*  Jeffries answer was Trump is assaulting the American way of life. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=512.88s)]
*  So look, 80 percent of Democrats, 90 percent of Democrats might totally disagree with people [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=516.96s)]
*  who say that you should get shot in order to make a point. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=522.16s)]
*  But the vocal 10 percent is having a moment because there's nobody else out there who [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=525.08s)]
*  is talking. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=530.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=531.6s)]
*  Leadership abhors a vacuum. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=532.6s)]
*  But you know who loves a vacuum? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=533.6s)]
*  Women. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=534.6s)]
*  Harold told me that in the break. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=535.6s)]
*  Wait, there was no break. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=538.12s)]
*  We just started. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=539.36s)]
*  So it does seem to me that this is another example where the Dems look at an 80 20 issue [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  and they always choose the 20 preferring to protect lawbreakers instead of helping out [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=545.72s)]
*  the law. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=551.16s)]
*  It's ironic because there is a 700 percent increase in attacks. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=552.16s)]
*  We heard this from Homeland Security against officers and threats against their families [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=556.44s)]
*  as well. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=561.64s)]
*  But ironically, and President Trump mentioned this, you know, here in New York, we're dealing [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=562.98s)]
*  with attacks by people who are wearing ski masks. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  We have anti-Semitic protesters wearing ski masks. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=571.8000000000001s)]
*  It's taken years for our assembly to do something to unmask these people. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  They finally came to some decision in April. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=581.32s)]
*  But basically it was not to like, you know, really crack down on them. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  But they're starting. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=588.0400000000001s)]
*  Mayor Adams wanted to actually find them. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=589.84s)]
*  But we're not at that point either. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  But there is a serious problem. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=594.32s)]
*  It's like I said, it's ironic. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  They don't want so and so to wear a mask. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=599.16s)]
*  The officers to wear a mask. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=601.76s)]
*  But the ones who are protesters, it's OK if they wear a mask. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=603.72s)]
*  No problem. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  Everybody should wear a mask. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=610.1999999999999s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=612.1999999999999s)]
*  Don't we all wear masks? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNMfB3ndVw&t=613.1999999999999s)]
