# 'The Five': Democrats distance themselves from Biden media tour
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Katie Pavlich along with Rosanna Scato, Harold Ford Jr., Joey Jones, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=0.0s)]
*  and Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=5.88s)]
*  It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=6.88s)]
*  A New Jersey mayor arrested after he joined three Democratic members of Congress who broke [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=16.56s)]
*  into a New Jersey ICE facility that holds some of the very violent migrant offenders, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=21.96s)]
*  including an MS-13 gang member. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=27.52s)]
*  We'll fill you in on that later. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=29.96s)]
*  But first, the man who destroyed the Democrats. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=31.96s)]
*  Joe Biden's return to the View was a train wreck for a party that's desperate to move [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  on. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=40.44s)]
*  At one point, poor Joe was asked about his mental decline and needed Dr. Jill to swoop [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=41.52s)]
*  right in and save him like the Easter Bunny from the ladies of the View. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=46.44s)]
*  What is your response to these allegations and are these sources wrong? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=52.44s)]
*  They are wrong. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=55.96s)]
*  There's nothing to sustain that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=57.92s)]
*  And so we went to work and we got it done. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=60.36s)]
*  And you know, one of the things that, well, I'm not talking to them all. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=63.2s)]
*  Well, and Alyssa, you know, one of the things I think is that the people who wrote those [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=68.76s)]
*  books were not in the White House with us and they didn't see how hard Joe worked every [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=73.6s)]
*  single day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  If you look at things today, give me Joe Biden anytime. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, the left may be ready to move on, but the stench of Biden's failed four years in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=87.32s)]
*  office still lingers in the air. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=91.0s)]
*  But some say enough is enough. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=93.44s)]
*  The Obama pod bros are going nuclear on Sleepy Joe. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=95.55999999999999s)]
*  He shouldn't have run for a second term. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  And when he did run for a second term, he should have stepped down much earlier after [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=102.96s)]
*  the debate and his close advisers shouldn't have told him to run again and they shouldn't [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  have told him he was going to win. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  This media tour is about Joe Biden. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=112.16s)]
*  It's not about Donald Trump. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  It's about Joe Biden defending himself and his legacy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=116.72s)]
*  He's made it about himself. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=119.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=120.12s)]
*  And that I think was something that he made the last year of his presidency about. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=121.12s)]
*  It's not something you're going to solve on The View. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=124.84s)]
*  And so it's like step back. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  If you really truly believe that the work you did was good, then you have to trust history [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=128.56s)]
*  to judge it correctly. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=131.96s)]
*  So Greg, the Bidens go on The View to basically gaslight and say everything was fine still, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=134.48s)]
*  even though we watched and know it wasn't. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=140.24s)]
*  But you know, these guys are talking about 2024. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=142.36s)]
*  The mistake was 2020. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=145.32s)]
*  The biggest mistake the Dems ever made was run that guy, picking him and letting him [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=147.4s)]
*  letting himself expose the shallow and useless nature of their party. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=152.4s)]
*  He will go down as the worst president in history. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=158.92s)]
*  No question. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=161.44s)]
*  The party was already a mess, but they picked the worst possible person to front it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=162.48s)]
*  It's like Mattel making Casey Anthony, their CEO, a disaster. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=167.48s)]
*  And I think we're letting the media off too lightly. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=171.92s)]
*  Right now, they're saying, and you can hear it with those guys, hey, it was the White [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=174.04s)]
*  House who kept us from knowing Joe was a mess, as if journalists were under house arrest. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=177.56s)]
*  You know, it's like the mission of their job, which is actually to report. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=183.76s)]
*  They can't do that anymore. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=186.8s)]
*  They only tell the story, but they wouldn't let us. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=188.02s)]
*  So instead, they have a billion dollar company behind them. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=192.4s)]
*  They have all the tools needed to tell a story. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=194.8s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=197.38s)]
*  The White House would be upset with him if they did it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=198.6s)]
*  So they didn't. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=200.5s)]
*  And that's on the White House's fault. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=201.5s)]
*  No, you're journalists. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=202.5s)]
*  You're supposed to report things, not just tell stories based on your assumptions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=203.6s)]
*  It used to be if you told a reporter that you can't report on something, that would [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=208.28s)]
*  energize them to report on it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=213.12s)]
*  But now they've been reduced to sonographers. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=215.62s)]
*  They don't chase a story. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=217.88s)]
*  They tell a story or they repurpose it from another story. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=219.32s)]
*  This is actually the biggest political story of a generation, but they avoided it because [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=223.24s)]
*  they didn't want to feel ashamed about it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=227.98s)]
*  And I get how they want to move on. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=230.0s)]
*  Who wouldn't? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=232.46s)]
*  When a criminal is arrested, he'd love everyone to move on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=233.46s)]
*  But the criminal doesn't get to decide when you move on. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=237.1s)]
*  We do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=240.02s)]
*  And again, this cover-up merits the kind of scrutiny that should have been there in the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=241.02s)]
*  first place if the party had simply done the work at the start, paid attention to the voters [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=245.02s)]
*  and not to the activists, stopped indulging the false promise of identity politics and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  actually looked outward at the world. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=255.5s)]
*  It wouldn't be in this problem. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  They're still in this problem. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=258.52s)]
*  So, Joey, I remember the Democrats doing everything they could to not have a primary process. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=259.84s)]
*  They were keeping candidates off the ballot, using lawfare to go against RFK Jr. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=264.58s)]
*  So the Obama aides trying to argue that it was just all Joe Biden and not the Democratic [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=269.74s)]
*  Party and the DNC doing this seems a little bit of a rewrite of history. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=275.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's so funny about them getting upset at David Hogg for running primary. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=279.56s)]
*  It's like you've always had your thumb on the scale. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=283.52s)]
*  That's your problem. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  We don't have a deep bench because you've gotten in between anyone who could. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=286.92s)]
*  Could you imagine someone taking the Democrat Party by storm the way Trump took the Republican [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=291.56s)]
*  Party by storm in 2016? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=295.24s)]
*  The way it exists now, it probably couldn't happen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=297.04s)]
*  And most Republicans would sit there and say that's the best thing that ever happened to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=299.76s)]
*  the party. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=303.88s)]
*  It was the only thing that could have saved it from the Bush years and the fizzle out [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=304.88s)]
*  of the Tea Party. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  But as far as Biden coming back out there, I wonder if Trump sent him a gift basket or [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  this is the best thing that could happen. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=315.32s)]
*  There are a lot of headlines right now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=317.0s)]
*  Pakistan and India, there's Ukraine and Russia. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=318.0s)]
*  There are a lot of things that Democrats could pretend to be upset about and say that President [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=321.04s)]
*  Trump isn't doing well. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=324.92s)]
*  But instead, their podcast and their biggest television show are talking about Biden again. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=326.24s)]
*  Harold, I know that you have been a proponent of moving on from the Bidens for a long time. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=331.32s)]
*  They were back this week. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=336.8s)]
*  Your thoughts on them getting back on the national stage and telling the story this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  way? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  It's going to be back around the table. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  I think you said it well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=344.88s)]
*  I he lost the race. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=345.88s)]
*  I think one of the reasons he's probably out these these days is because Biden, that is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=348.08s)]
*  because the books are coming out and he wants to show that he was not that he was not out [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=352.52s)]
*  of it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  He said when he ran in 2020, he would be a transitional figure. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=358.08s)]
*  Then he would take the he wanted to beat Donald Trump and move the country to a new generation [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  of leadership. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=366.56s)]
*  And I think a lot of people took him at his word. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=367.56s)]
*  And that that didn't happen. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=368.56s)]
*  I think Democrats now, I wouldn't respond to him at all. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=370.28s)]
*  I think that those guys out there with the podcast, they've got they seem like they got [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=372.8s)]
*  a good thing going. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=375.8s)]
*  I'd be talking about issues. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=376.8s)]
*  I mean, what are the priorities of the Democratic Party? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=377.8s)]
*  We're about to engage in a real debate around taxes. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  Who do we want to cut taxes for? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=383.16s)]
*  How are we going to stimulate Main Street business growth? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=384.6s)]
*  Who do we want to raise taxes on if we have to raise taxes to pay for these things? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  President Trump has talked about the need and perhaps the the reasons behind taxing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  people who are earning multiples of millions of dollars a year to help pay down a debt [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=395.68s)]
*  and do the things we have to do to provide no taxes on tips and no taxes on overtime. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=399.56s)]
*  Those are the things that would be most useful to talk about if you're a Democrat. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=405.2s)]
*  And if President Biden wants to continue to go on shows to help himself, I think one of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  the guys there at the end said this is all about Biden and not about anything else. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=414.12s)]
*  Let him do that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  That will run its course. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  Let us go forward with a set of ideas and what our priorities are laying it out for [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=419.47999999999996s)]
*  the country. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=423.35999999999996s)]
*  So, Rosanna, the the Biden is not the only problem brewing inside the Democratic Party. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  You also have a number of people on the far left and you have James Carville, who sees [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=429.0s)]
*  himself as more of a centrist, telling him that they need to get out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=433.08s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=437.23999999999995s)]
*  God, these people are just helpless. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  They cannot be helped. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  There's nothing you can do to help them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=444.0s)]
*  They don't want to be helped. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=446.28s)]
*  And if they had any guts to start their own political party and get out of hours. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=447.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=453.88s)]
*  So he's specifically referring to people like Congressman Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=455.12s)]
*  who has been campaigning with Bernie Sanders, may run for president. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=461.2s)]
*  So they've got some big issues to work out. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=464.32s)]
*  They're still digesting the election. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=466.08s)]
*  They still can't believe that the American public went in there at a time when their [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=468.52s)]
*  eggs were too high, their gas was too high and they was watching their neighborhoods [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=473.24s)]
*  change with the influx of migrants. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=479.04s)]
*  And so they don't they don't know how to react to that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=482.0s)]
*  But the Bidens now, they're just trying to save their legacy. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=484.8s)]
*  They're trying to get out in front of all these books that are going to drop in the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=488.12s)]
*  next two weeks. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=492.2s)]
*  Jake Tapper is defending his book, which I think is going to be pretty explosive. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=493.56s)]
*  He said he spoke to 200 people who had a lot to say in the White House. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=498.84s)]
*  They're all Democrats. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=505.48s)]
*  They're all Biden lovers. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=506.84s)]
*  But that's not enough for Joe Biden. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=508.92s)]
*  She thinks that you have to be in, I guess, her bedroom watching Joe work so hard while [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=510.6s)]
*  she read a book. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=515.84s)]
*  I think it's funny that the arsonists now, Joey, are the ones who are coming to to save [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=518.44s)]
*  the day on this saying, look at all these things that are happening that we never want [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=522.48s)]
*  to talk about until we can make money on books. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=526.32s)]
*  Yeah. And all the people that are saying that now are the ones who are gaslighting us [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=527.8s)]
*  that were telling us what we were seeing was not what we were really seeing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=531.28s)]
*  Kind of the same thing with the riots. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=534.48s)]
*  Mostly peaceful. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=536.6s)]
*  Joe Biden was mostly sentient. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=537.88s)]
*  Not only that, he was running circles around his staff. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. So we'll see if they should. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  He should hire Kareem Jean-Pierre to go out and be a spokesperson for him. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=544.3599999999999s)]
*  I think she's done with him as well. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=548.16s)]
*  So they're having a rough time keeping some friends. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6Hi_FU0R4&t=549.88s)]
