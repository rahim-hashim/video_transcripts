# 'The Five' unpacks implications of the deadly Israeli Embassy shooting
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Sandra Smith along with Kaylee McEnany, Harold Ford Jr., Jesse Waters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=0.0s)]
*  and Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=9.78s)]
*  It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=11.64s)]
*  Brand new charges announced against the suspect accused of gunning down two Israeli embassy [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=20.52s)]
*  workers and bragging about it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Elias Rodriguez charged with two counts of first degree murder and other charges. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=27.4s)]
*  They're also looking at hate crime and terrorism charges over the deaths of Yaron Leshinsky [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=32.64s)]
*  and Sarah Milgram. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=37.32s)]
*  They were a young couple that was about to get engaged, shot in cold blood as they were [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=38.84s)]
*  leaving a benefit at the Capital Jewish Museum in D.C. with the suspected killer later caught [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=43.16s)]
*  on tape chanting this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=48.84s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=50.84s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=52.84s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=56.84s)]
*  An eyewitness describing the shocking scene and how she spent 10 terrifying minutes with [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=60.84s)]
*  the accused gunman. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=66.68s)]
*  They moved us all into like an area and were trying to keep us safe, not understanding [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  that we were in the room for 10 whole minutes with the murderer. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=75.4s)]
*  He's like, oh, what kind of museum is this? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=78.84s)]
*  And I'm like, it's a Jewish museum. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=80.84s)]
*  And he asks, do you think that's why they did it in reference to the gunshots we had [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  heard? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=88.84s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, maybe. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=89.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  But I don't think so. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  And that's when he reaches into his bag and pulls out a keffiyeh and says to me, I did [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=97.44s)]
*  it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=103.44s)]
*  I did this for Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=104.44s)]
*  And now in the wake of those horrific murders, there's new scrutiny of college campuses that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  have left radical pro-terror propaganda fester amid a growing rise of anti-Semitism. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=111.2s)]
*  Just yesterday, a vile scene outside of Columbia's graduation with students burning their diplomas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=117.8s)]
*  You can't, you can't, you can't! [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=124.16s)]
*  You're committing genocide! [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=128.96s)]
*  And breaking earlier, the Trump administration terminating Harvard's student visa program. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=133.44s)]
*  I want to get some more on that in just a minute. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=139.24s)]
*  But Jesse, to you first on this, just this heinous, awful crime that occurred last night [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=141.96s)]
*  and the accused gunman. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=147.64s)]
*  What did you think when you saw him there chanting, free Palestine, free Palestine? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=149.4s)]
*  Well, he's a killer. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=155.16s)]
*  And that chant is getting a little crazy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=158.52s)]
*  They make excuses for these chants, Sandra. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=163.12s)]
*  You know, we're all for free speech. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=165.32s)]
*  But when you start committing murder after chanting it, you're going to bring down a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=167.34s)]
*  lot of hell on that movement. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=172.12s)]
*  They're now going to revoke visas. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=174.84s)]
*  They're going to freeze money. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=176.96s)]
*  You saw Harvard. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=179.04s)]
*  They can't even bring in foreign students. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  You're going to get spied on if you're at these rallies now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=183.0s)]
*  It's getting dangerous for these people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=186.76s)]
*  They want to stop the war in Gaza, and that's fine. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=189.44s)]
*  You can criticize Israel. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=193.44s)]
*  You can even go so far as to call it a genocide. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=194.68s)]
*  But when you start committing heinous acts like this, not only is this movement going [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=197.4s)]
*  to be decimated in the United States, it's going to backfire in the Middle East. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=202.28s)]
*  We're on the precipice of possibly getting an Iranian nuclear deal, Abraham Accords. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=207.64s)]
*  People in Washington, D.C., is not going to lead us to peace in the region. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=216.2s)]
*  It's only going to make things worse. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=221.72s)]
*  The left has more assassins than ideas. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  You go down the list. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  You got Luigi. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  You got the Scalise shooter, two Trump assassins, the Kavanaugh guy, the IVF bomber. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  Some arsonists tried to take out Shapiro's home. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  So this left-wing violence is compounding. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  And then there's this media environment that permission slips it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=243.9s)]
*  Oh, you know, it's just a phrase from the river to the sea. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=248.06s)]
*  You understand the historical context. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=253.22s)]
*  They're financing it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=256.58s)]
*  They're nurturing it at universities. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=258.66s)]
*  And then they're downplaying it after the fact. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=261.02s)]
*  You saw it in the Oval Office last night. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=262.74s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=264.7s)]
*  It's only a few white farmers being murdered. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=265.7s)]
*  I mean, we're not at the genocide level yet. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=269.06s)]
*  I mean, this is what they're doing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=272.34s)]
*  And this has to stop now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  So look no further than social media, Kayleigh, to get a glimpse of what would lead someone [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=277.26s)]
*  to carry out this just this awful thing that happened to two people who were apparently [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=282.97999999999996s)]
*  in love and looking to get married and engaged and married soon. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=288.14s)]
*  This accused gunman reportedly posted death to America on some of his posts, unhinged [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=292.14s)]
*  That also includes praise for Luigi Mangione. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=299.3s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=302.62s)]
*  The dehumanization of life to Jesse's exact point. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=303.62s)]
*  Yaron had just purchased Sarah a ring this week. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=306.82s)]
*  Imagine you purchase a ring for your fiancee, not knowing days later that you both will [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=310.62s)]
*  no longer be here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=315.5s)]
*  This is tragic. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=317.06s)]
*  And we have to look at the roots of what is happening on our universities and look no [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  further than just a little bit from that museum. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=321.78s)]
*  Look no further than George Washington University. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=324.82s)]
*  I will never forget the phrase that was lit up on the wall of the library at GWU. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=327.06s)]
*  What was the phrase? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=332.9s)]
*  Glory to our martyrs. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=333.9s)]
*  Well, the martyrs, so-called martyrs, killed with their bare hands a 10-month-old boy named [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=334.9s)]
*  Kefir Bevis, a four-year-old boy named Ariel Bevis. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=341.74s)]
*  Those are your martyrs? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=344.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=345.7s)]
*  And then they put from the river to the sea up on that university. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=346.7s)]
*  Those kids were suspended. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=349.26s)]
*  But, you know, that's just a mile away. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=350.26s)]
*  Go up the eastern corridor. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=352.26s)]
*  Let's come up here to New York. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=353.78s)]
*  And what do you find? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=354.78s)]
*  Barry Weiss has detailed all of this. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=356.5s)]
*  A professor who called October 7th awesome. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=357.94s)]
*  Well, let's go a little bit further up the eastern corridor. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=360.85999999999996s)]
*  And here's what you find. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=364.09999999999997s)]
*  A professor at Cornell who called the attacks energizing, exhilarating. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  Professor at Princeton, or kids at Princeton who said globalize the Antifada. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=369.41999999999996s)]
*  When you have this insidious ideology coming out of our universities, it needs to be rooted [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=373.78s)]
*  out. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=378.5s)]
*  Anti-Semitism needs to be pushed out of society because this was predictable. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=379.5s)]
*  This was predictable and it should have been stopped. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=383.94s)]
*  And thank God for President Trump having the will to say, we're stopping this on my watch. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=385.94s)]
*  He did. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=390.5s)]
*  And there was also obviously a lot coming in from members of Congress reacting to this, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=391.5s)]
*  condemning this, with the exception of Ilhan Omar, who ran away from a reporter when asked [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=396.58000000000004s)]
*  about this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=401.38s)]
*  Harold? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=402.38s)]
*  Well, I don't have any. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=403.38s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's good to be back around the table. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=404.38s)]
*  I don't answer for her. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm a Democrat and a proud Democrat. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  What happened in Washington, D.C. has nothing to do with my party. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=410.5s)]
*  This was an act of hatred that should be condemned. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=414.1s)]
*  We are human beings and when human beings treat human beings like this, they should [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=417.22s)]

*  Hatred, unfortunately, Sandra, is bipartisan. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=422.38s)]
*  But we shouldn't even be talking about the political leaning of it either way. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=426.72s)]
*  I hear what we're saying and I think I understand a little bit of it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=431.62s)]
*  This, I think I understand where you're coming from, but this act here, whomever is unable [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=435.38s)]
*  to condemn this, whoever is unable to speak about how we shouldn't be talking this way [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=438.82s)]
*  and we should be trying to heal and not divide, that person should be punished. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=444.7s)]
*  If you act violently with this, Luigi or whomever, what I don't understand with Luigi, I think [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=450.5s)]
*  there are people who are supporting this guy. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=454.62s)]
*  There are people who are sending money to him. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=456.78s)]
*  Something's deeper and rotten in our society when someone on broad daylight, the beginning [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=459.18s)]
*  of the morning, shoots down a person and people are supporting that person because [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=464.94s)]
*  they tend to think his ideas around something or something they may support. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=469.06s)]
*  He killed someone and this person who's been accused of this, the young man there in the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=474.28s)]
*  image there, he shot down and killed two people. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=479.42s)]
*  I don't care what his politics are, he should be punished. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=482.42s)]
*  So I just caution all of us. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=485.4s)]
*  I think I understand a little bit what we're doing here, but this is an act of hatred and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=487.1s)]
*  an act of violence. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=492.18s)]
*  I wish it was all just one party. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=493.18s)]
*  Even if it was my party, we could figure out a way to deal with it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=495.58s)]
*  But unfortunately, hatred and division and violence knows no political party, knows no [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=498.02s)]
*  geography. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=503.86s)]
*  There's something rotten and something wrong and we've got to figure out how we address [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=504.86s)]
*  it as a society. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=508.62s)]
*  I just want to make sure I update that she did eventually after running away from a reporter [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=510.1s)]
*  and not responding when asked about these shootings last night, Ilhan Omar did post [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=514.7s)]
*  eventually saying she was appalled by the deadly shooting at the Capital Jewish Museum [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=520.26s)]
*  last night and she's holding the victims and their families and loved ones in her thoughts. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=523.8199999999999s)]
*  Greg your thoughts? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=529.14s)]
*  As much as I adore Harold, I must disagree completely. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=530.14s)]
*  Imagine if this were reversed. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=534.78s)]
*  You can't because there are no large groups of young people taking over colleges on behalf [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  of some militant white nationalist movement. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=542.26s)]
*  Hatred like this isn't bipartisan. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=546.16s)]
*  So how do you explain this when what you're shouting for leads to the result that you're [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=548.78s)]
*  shouting for? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=552.66s)]
*  And when a Jewish student goes to school and sees these mobs, do they have to be satisfied [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=554.04s)]
*  with the reassurance that it's just words? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=558.8199999999999s)]
*  What's your problem? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=562.42s)]
*  No one's bothering you. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=563.42s)]
*  This school year ain't going to be easy for them. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=565.3s)]
*  In a perfect world, this act would be a wake up call for the naive romantic activist who [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=569.06s)]
*  adopted the cause because climate change imploded and BLM went bankrupt. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=574.86s)]
*  This violence is exactly what Hamas wants and they appreciate your support. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=580.98s)]

*  Your hobby is their mission. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=588.64s)]
*  If you don't see that now, I mean, if you're a young female activist at Brown on her daddy's [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=591.86s)]
*  dime, this isn't college theater, something that you do for fun until you get that internship [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=597.9399999999999s)]
*  at the law firm. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=603.5s)]
*  This is a hobby that has deadly consequences. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=604.8199999999999s)]
*  Two people died because you feel really good, you know, walking down Fifth Avenue or blocking [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=608.2199999999999s)]
*  the Brooklyn Bridge. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=613.06s)]
*  Wasn't that great? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  When you hear the word genocide, you can argue whether it's correct or not. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=616.68s)]
*  That's not the point. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  It's who benefits from the genocide narrative. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=622.6999999999999s)]
*  It's not Israel. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=626.28s)]
*  It's Hamas. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=627.42s)]
*  The idea that Israel's like, hey, hooray, let's go genocide everyone. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=628.42s)]
*  That's idiotic. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=632.26s)]
*  That's the first thing for their country, their brand and their relationship to the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=633.26s)]
*  West. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=637.5s)]
*  This is why we're always talking to them about peace. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=638.5s)]
*  The genocidal accusation directly benefits Hamas, which is why they have been obviously [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=640.54s)]
*  exaggerating the numbers, which they still do today, or they place offensive weaponry, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=645.7s)]
*  terror cells and hostages among citizens to drive up the numbers because the more Palestinians [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=650.5s)]
*  die, the better it is for them. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=655.9s)]
*  That's their only way of keeping power. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=657.9399999999999s)]
*  The only way to maintain power right now is to propagandize the globe and to create fear [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=660.64s)]
*  through carnage like that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=666.08s)]
*  So you got to wonder, well, if we actually acquiesce, say we're no longer supporting [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=667.92s)]
*  Israel, do you think this extremism would stop? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=673.4s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=676.88s)]
*  They make it about something else about the West because that's how it always is. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=677.88s)]
*  So this problem will be here forever. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=683.14s)]
*  It's just going to take on a different costume. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=686.32s)]
*  Greg, the only other thing is that these pro-Hamas people, they came and protested Kamala Harris' [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=689.24s)]
*  events, they came and protested Pelosi's events. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=695.48s)]
*  And if I remember correctly, President Trump went to Dearborn, Michigan because so many [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  of that group was mad at Democrats. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=702.6400000000001s)]
*  I just don't think, I think it's bipartisan. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=704.32s)]
*  We can differ on that, but I want to be clear about, I don't answer for this Omar Congress, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=706.6s)]
*  the Congresswoman Omar, and none of my Democratic friends do, and I am not only appalled, I [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=711.6400000000001s)]
*  share Greg's, what you shared there about the Palestinians. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=715.96s)]
*  I couldn't agree with you more. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=718.9200000000001s)]
*  And I hope at a minimum that nothing changes on our government's part in our support for [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=720.24s)]
*  Israel. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=725.08s)]
*  Omar is part of the Democratic caucus. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=726.08s)]
*  So is Marjorie Taylor. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=727.08s)]
*  Right, but I could point to Republicans that are part of, that did things that, all I'm [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=728.08s)]
*  saying is I just- [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  The students on universities do not hail from the right who are chanting from the river [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  to the sea, I can assure you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=735.48s)]
*  But Mr. President Trump went to Dearborn and embraced that mayor and those others there [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=736.76s)]
*  who had been saying that Democrats were not enough in favor of the Palestinians in the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUQGSgLDw8&t=740.2s)]
