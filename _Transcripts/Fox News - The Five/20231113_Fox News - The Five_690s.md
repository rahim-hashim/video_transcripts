# Jesse Watters: If you're conservative, it's dangerous to protest
**Fox News - The Five:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw)
*  Another weekend of chaos with anti-Israel protesters flooding the streets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=0.0s)]
*  Over a thousand people marching in Manhattan with one agitator getting cheered on [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=3.44s)]
*  while tearing down an American flag. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=7.68s)]
*  Others facing off with police while smashing on doors outside of Grand Central Station. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=10.0s)]
*  In Delaware, a group marching outside Biden's home demanding a ceasefire [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=14.4s)]
*  and accusing him of supporting genocide. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=18.56s)]
*  Let's go to Austin, Texas, a group of protesters on horseback [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  waving Palestinian flags while taking over the streets. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=24.76s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris asked to condemn what we've been seeing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=27.8s)]
*  Instead, she said this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  People have a right to protest. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=33.64s)]
*  We are a democracy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=36.44s)]
*  And we should value the voices and listen to the voices. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=38.36s)]
*  What I hope is that we can engage in conversation and discourse [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  in a way that understands this is not binary. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=46.84s)]
*  Not to mention what it means in our own country in terms of longstanding issues [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=50.2s)]
*  with anti-Semitism, which has been on the rise even before this happened. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=56.44s)]
*  Islamophobia and other forms of hate against people [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  just simply based on who they are or how they pray. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=65.6s)]
*  A lot of words. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=68.96s)]
*  So she's not the only Democrat raising eyebrows. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=70.56s)]
*  Liberal Bill Maher berating Barack Obama over the former president's moral equivalency [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=73.16s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=77.44s)]
*  I must say I am struggling with people's moral equivalency still. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=78.96s)]
*  I mean, Barack Obama, who has rarely disappointed me, did so this week. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  The attack was only a month ago. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=90.52s)]
*  A more savage attack than we've ever seen in reverse. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=93.0s)]
*  There's a big difference between collateral damage and what Hamas did. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=95.44s)]
*  When they fire at Israel, it's a war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  When Israel fires back, it's a war crime. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=100.16s)]
*  Little crazy. So and also, would Hamas do that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=103.16s)]
*  Would they give four hour pause? No, no pausing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  Jesse, is there a little bit of daylight between Kamala Harris and Biden? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=110.2s)]
*  Because Biden has been pretty stalwart in saying Israel has the right to defend itself. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=115.16s)]
*  And I'm just wondering if there is a little bit of Kamala Harris saying we got to see both sides here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=121.88s)]
*  That might be by design, that daylight, because they're trying to straddle supporting Israel [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=126.28s)]
*  and managing the protest movement so it doesn't hurt them in the election. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=131.96s)]
*  But I'm with Greg. I might just convert to woke to be able to protest, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=136.48s)]
*  because if you're a conservative and you go to a school board meeting and raise a ruckus [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=140.48s)]
*  because some transgender kid raped your daughter in a bathroom and the school covered it up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  Or maybe you're a Tea Party protester who didn't like the Wall Street bailouts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=149.6s)]
*  Or perhaps you wanted to support election integrity. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=154.0s)]
*  Or maybe you held a sign at Michigan State House and said, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  we'd like to go back to work now, Governor. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=159.04s)]
*  If you do that, you get audited, you get arrested, you get smeared. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  You probably get put on a no-fly list. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=165.12s)]
*  Maybe the Southern Poverty Law Center cancels your life. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=166.96s)]
*  But you're saying if you have a massive movement all over the country for a month [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=171.6s)]
*  where you're desecrating monuments, vandalizing the White House, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=176.4s)]
*  it's now deadly, you murdered a Jewish guy in Los Angeles. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Everyone just wants to be cautious. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=184.16s)]
*  Let's just give them room to breathe. Let's not do anything. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=185.6s)]
*  You don't get the full weight of the federal government, the military industrial complex, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=188.08s)]
*  the Democrat media industrial complex raining down on your movement. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=193.04s)]
*  You don't get that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=197.28s)]
*  And that's not right. And that's not fair. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=198.88s)]
*  And at this point, the American people, if you're a conservative, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=201.2s)]
*  it's almost dangerous to get out on the street and protest. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=204.16s)]
*  But it's not dangerous to get out on the street and hoist the Palestinian flag [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  and tear down the American flag. There's like no arrests. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=212.72s)]
*  Right. And Greg, where is the White House urgency about American hostages? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=215.92s)]
*  Nowhere. I'm still trying to make heads or tails of what Kamala just said. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=220.55999999999997s)]
*  So she said not binary or non-binary. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=226.16s)]
*  In applying to this, she might be right in that there's only one way, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=230.48s)]
*  one way to look at what happened. There isn't two ways. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=235.2s)]
*  So maybe that's non-binary. If it's non-binary, you could say one direction is non-binary. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=238.72s)]
*  Because the people that say there are both sides are relying on a historical narrative [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=246.24s)]
*  to justify present day atrocity. It's only about October 7th. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=251.28s)]
*  We don't care about anything before because that thing is the worst thing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=256.32s)]
*  we've seen since 9-11. Maybe if you look at the pictures, it might be worse. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=260.48s)]
*  So it's a mental state versus the Jewish state. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  And the only way these anti-Semocrats can embrace a truly immoral repulsive act [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=268.88s)]
*  is by conjuring up a context to justify or erase or deny terror. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=274.16s)]
*  You know, Bill Maher is like a lodestar for the central liberal, centrist liberal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=280.0s)]
*  You know, when your party blinks before a contingent that uses the word but [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=284.24s)]
*  after saying Hamas beheaded babies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=290.72s)]
*  But you need to run screaming from that party. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  You cannot march metaphorically or liberal, literally alongside [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=298.16s)]
*  genocidal deniers. This is not part of the big picture. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=302.96s)]
*  The only picture is from October 7th. It goes back to this thing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  You have a delusional generation of young people out there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  So you have to examine how we lost these people. What happened? What happened? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=314.56s)]
*  So what used to education used to be a social issue, but now it's a security issue. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=320.08s)]
*  You should start worrying a little bit. What are they telling them? Right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=324.56s)]
*  There's anti-West propaganda now being taught in schools. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=328.4s)]
*  And maybe it's time to rethink how we look at education. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=332.16s)]
*  It's not a social thing anymore. It's a security thing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=335.44s)]
*  This is now about the future of our country. What do we do? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=338.72s)]
*  Judge, the Jewish people are 2.6 percent of the U.S. population, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=342.24s)]
*  yet suffer 60 percent of hate crimes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=346.72s)]
*  Hate crimes against Jewish Americans are up 400 percent since October 7th. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=350.24s)]
*  And the response from the White House was a national strategy on Islamophobia. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=355.36s)]
*  Yeah. The amazing part of it is that—and I think that Jesse is right—I think that this [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=359.76s)]
*  administration is trying to straddle both issues. And I don't understand it because I think I [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  mentioned last week that the Arab American vote nationwide is like 1 percent. So this whole idea [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  that we have to maybe need a two-state solution, and with Kamala says, I hope we can have a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=377.84s)]
*  conversation and discourse. None of these people who are marching and protesting want [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=384.24s)]
*  a conversation and discourse. When they start chanting, settlers, settlers, go back home, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=390.0s)]
*  Palestine is ours alone, that's not a conversation. That's not a two-state solution. Or we don't want [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=395.36s)]
*  a Jewish state. We just want back 48, which is when Israel became a nation state. And from the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=401.76s)]
*  river to the sea. I mean, everybody knows that's for the elimination of Israel. And the same [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=408.32s)]
*  statement that someone made when they attack Israel, it's war. But when Israel defends herself, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=413.84s)]
*  pursuant to the laws of war, it's a war crime. And this is something that has repeated itself [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=420.08s)]
*  throughout history. And now America is stuck with a group of people, not just a group of people, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=426.08s)]
*  an incredible chaos, a mob of people who are standing up for Palestine when Palestine was [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=431.44s)]
*  given the ability to take over Gaza and they elected Hamas. And this is one of the consequences. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=438.64s)]
*  And Israel waited weeks before they started the assault to let them get out. But I think that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=443.76s)]
*  using a transgender term, Greg, I didn't understand it either, which is a non-binary, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=449.92s)]
*  non-binary. You know, the truth is we've got American hostages over there. We're in the middle [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=454.4s)]
*  of a war. You take a side in a war. You can straddle. Jessica, tomorrow there is a anti-Semitism [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=459.36s)]
*  march in pro-Israel march in Washington, D.C. I expect it's going to get a large [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=467.6s)]
*  turnout. Imagine if Biden or Kamala Harris actually went to that. Wow. I think it would [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  be great. I have a lot of friends that are going to... That's probably not happening. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't think that that's fair. I mean, as you said in your opener asking if there's daylight [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=483.68s)]
*  between Biden and Kamala on this, I happen to think that both of them have been very, very clear about [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=489.44s)]
*  where the U.S. stands on this. Joe Biden has been more pro-Israel than Israelis expected, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=495.6s)]
*  more than Bibi Netanyahu expected, more than other world leaders who have followed him into this, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=502.56s)]
*  saying you unequivocally get our support for everything that you need. I'd love it if they [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=509.6s)]
*  showed up. I don't know if that's on the docket, but either way, I expect a wonderful turnout there [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=514.08s)]
*  as it should be. But what Kamala Harris is talking about, and she said not binary, first of all, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=521.28s)]
*  in terms of this isn't a black and white issue. Everyone who is marching with the Palestinian flag [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=525.92s)]
*  or with these people is not necessarily pro-Hamas. Some of them are actually out there saying [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=531.04s)]
*  we need to free Palestine. I have issues with the occupation, what goes on or what they perceive [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=536.4s)]
*  as the occupation in the West Bank. Now, do I think it's the right time for that? Absolutely not, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=540.64s)]
*  because this is all about, as Greg said, what happened on October 7th. There was a ceasefire [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=544.72s)]
*  that day, and it was violated by one group of terrorists that did this. But 388 percent spike [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=548.88s)]
*  in anti-Semitic hate crimes, 182 percent spike in Islamophobic hate crimes. That is also existing [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=554.8s)]
*  within our borders. She is the vice president for all Americans. And I don't, I get that people want [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=561.28s)]
*  to score political points about it, but I don't know how people who are supportive of Israel and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=567.84s)]
*  want to make sure that they can do whatever they need to to root out Hamas and to avenge the deaths, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=573.44s)]
*  the 1,400 deaths and get those hostages back could complain about this administration. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=579.36s)]
*  And politics is a binary choice, and we saw that on election night, right? That there were Democrats [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=583.7600000000001s)]
*  and Republicans on the ballot and people picked Democrats. And I'm listening to the front runner [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=588.24s)]
*  on the other side talk, and Donald Trump is not only, it's seven times he's now confused [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=594.0s)]
*  Biden and Obama, which should put him in the mental acuity outhouse there, right? He can't [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=599.36s)]
*  find his pants, at least like Biden. But this is what the man tweets out. What is this? Because [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=606.16s)]
*  you're talking about the leadership that we're seeing. And then we're talking about Kamala and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=613.6s)]
*  Joe. Right. And I'm saying that all of this for people is contextualized in light of elections. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=617.76s)]
*  And what is on the other side of this matters to people. That's how there are lots of Jews [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=625.04s)]
*  who can't make a decision. When I see those marches, I don't see what you see. And I'm [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=629.6s)]
*  surprised you look at it this way, because those people don't like you. You know that. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=636.8000000000001s)]
*  Have I wavered one bit ever in anything I've said about that? That's not a political statement. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=642.72s)]
*  I'm not saying, oh, you got to do this. I'm not talking about Biden and I'm not talking about [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=648.1600000000001s)]
*  Trump. I'm talking about something bigger that is happening in this country that puts your life [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=653.6s)]
*  at risk. I understand that and I certainly deeply feel that. But this segment is about [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=659.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris, who is an elected official and who said that. But one of the things I wanted to point [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=663.12s)]
*  out is that there is a big march tomorrow for anti-Semitism. And it's going to be great. It's [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  going to be huge. We will cover it here on Fox News where you can see it. Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGi0DxnV-yw&t=673.92s)]
