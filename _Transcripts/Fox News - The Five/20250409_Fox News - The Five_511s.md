# 'PRETTY RACIST': Watters shreds Jasmine Crockett's argument over illegal immigration
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY)
*  The Democrats are starting to sound more like shock jocks than serious lawmakers, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=0.0s)]
*  as the loudest voices in the room step into the leadership void. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=4.88s)]
*  Wising star Jasmine Crockett is the MVP of Attention Seeking, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=8.88s)]
*  and she's defending the need for illegal immigrants with this shocking take. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=13.44s)]
*  So I had to go around the country and educate people about [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=19.04s)]
*  what immigrants do for this country or the fact that we are a country of immigrants. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=23.2s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=27.36s)]
*  The fact is, ain't none of y'all trying to go and farm right now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=28.56s)]
*  Okay, so I'm lying. Raise your hands. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=34.96s)]
*  You're not. You're not. We done picking cotton. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=42.4s)]
*  We are. You can't pay us enough to find a plantation. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  Democrats can showboat all they want, but at the end of the day, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  they are lacking that authenticity that makes President Trump a hit with the voters, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=58.24s)]
*  even Bill Maher gets it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=63.36s)]
*  Trump really interested is one of the most effective politicians, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=65.76s)]
*  whether whatever you think of the policy and him as a person always lean in to being more who you are. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=69.6s)]
*  The people are not savvy about issues, but they smell a phony a mile away. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=77.36s)]
*  Democrats have to come up with an alpha, and it's not Tim Walz. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=83.2s)]
*  Okay, Greg, why is it that only Maher sees that there's no masculinity in the Democrat [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  party and the rest of them can't see it? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Jasmine was pretty masculine there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  You know, I think he's authenticity is, I guess, linked to action. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=100.24s)]
*  Like you can, you get to know somebody by what they do. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=106.24s)]
*  And I think right now the Democrats are a collection of lightweights, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=108.88s)]
*  theater kids who instead of actually going to class, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  focus on the external appeal of identity politics. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=115.76s)]
*  She's changed based on identity politics. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  It's never what I do, it's who I am. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=120.56s)]
*  So this new guy comes in Trump, and he does stuff who acts instead of, you know, acts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=123.12s)]
*  So by comparison, you can kind of see their grip. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=129.52s)]
*  They seem very silly, you know, and having an allied media that enables you, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=132.0s)]
*  it doesn't it doesn't help because like when Harold comes to the five, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=136.8s)]
*  it's like he comes to the gym. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=140.56s)]
*  His ideas, he has to work out his ideas because there's opposition. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=142.0s)]
*  But for most Democrats, all Democrats outside of Fox, they don't have that gym. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=145.68s)]
*  They don't go out and work out. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=150.96s)]
*  So you have Jasmine there, you're basically using the same [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  justification for illegal immigration that you would for slavery. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=156.72s)]
*  It's just a few iterations in between. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=159.68s)]
*  It's also the driving force for a lot of globalism. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=161.84s)]
*  You know, I really love my iPhone and my Nike shoes, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=164.16s)]
*  as long as I don't see the ages and the condition of the people making it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=166.88s)]
*  Okay, Jesse, what do you think of the idea that we need illegals because the blacks [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=171.11999999999998s)]
*  aren't picking cotton anymore? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=177.04s)]
*  Well, I don't like that idea, Judge, and I think it's pretty racist. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  But, you know, whether it's whether it's guest. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=184.88s)]
*  Right. Of course, whether it's a guest worker program, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  whether it's people that come here seasonally, I guess some jobs in agriculture, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  jobs in agriculture, you have to have the people south of the border do it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  But that's not really the issue. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=201.44s)]
*  That's not the jobs they're taking. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=202.55999999999997s)]
*  They're taking actually good blue collar jobs all over the country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  Look at the South Side of Chicago. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  They didn't want them there and it's driving down wages and she should know better. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=209.76s)]
*  Greg hits on a key point in his kind of roundabout way. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  True. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  Authenticity is obvious on the right because we do the work. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=221.04s)]
*  We will sit for an hour or three on a podcast and let it rip. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=226.0s)]
*  You can't hide on a three hour podcast. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=230.96s)]
*  You can hide if you're a Democrat in the press because they'll just baby you and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=233.52s)]
*  they won't ask you anything and they won't even debate you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=237.2s)]
*  But it is primal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=240.96s)]
*  You can smell the authenticity. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=243.68s)]
*  You can smell the masculinity. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=246.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=249.84s)]
*  Is it deodorant? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=250.64s)]
*  Is it musk? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=251.76s)]
*  I had beans. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=252.72s)]
*  Is it some sort of cologne that Harold has on today? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=253.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=255.92s)]
*  I want the record to reflect. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=257.12s)]
*  It's just the natural musk of Harold Ford. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  Steve Inay has it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=262.08s)]
*  Steve Inay goes live and no holds barred and that's why he's rising. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=263.52s)]
*  That's why Marr, as wimpy as he is, gets it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  He'll smoke and he'll drink and he'll let it go but he understands the formula and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=275.12s)]
*  the formula now in new media direct to consumer. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=279.84s)]
*  You get real politicians that tweet, they talk and they podcast and you can either [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=284.16s)]
*  know they're legit or not. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=290.48s)]
*  Right now the Democrats aren't legit and everybody knows it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  Harold, Steve Inay says that he has no interest in running but he's going to keep [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=296.64s)]
*  the door open just in case no one shows up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=302.32s)]
*  What do you think of Steve Inay as a candidate? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=304.56s)]
*  I think everybody should run. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=306.32s)]
*  Again, I say that ideas at the end of the day have to be what inform and what influence [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=309.44s)]
*  and what stimulate a campaign. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=315.44s)]
*  I've tried to say for the life of me, I don't understand why these members of Congress and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=317.04s)]
*  the Senate who are really specializing in the energy stimulation space but aren't yet [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=321.12s)]
*  in the idea space. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=327.6s)]
*  We've talked about on the show, I don't understand why we're not out saying we want to build 20 [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=329.04s)]
*  million new homes for Americans who as we see aging homes and people moving into the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=333.76s)]
*  workforce. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=338.88s)]
*  We want a 5% cut in every agency across the country and the federal government. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=339.44s)]
*  We want to scale what's working, reform what can be reformed and scrap what's not. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=344.4s)]
*  Take taxes off the first $50,000 of earnings on the payroll tax and up the payroll tax to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  a half a million dollars to pay for it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=355.2s)]
*  We now scrap it out at about $200,000. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=356.8s)]
*  Make wealthier people pay a little bit more and let those working people like the president [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=359.12s)]
*  wants to do on no taxes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=362.88s)]
*  He is giving us an opening because he is so preoccupied what I think is an ineffective [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  way to bring business and jobs back to our country with his tariff plan. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=368.64s)]
*  Let's get focused on issues. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=372.4s)]
*  I don't need a history lesson on slavery. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=373.76s)]
*  What I do need is to tell me how we're going to inform people, educate people and make [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=375.68s)]
*  people's lives better by helping them make more money. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=381.04s)]
*  So you're going to endorse Stephen A? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=383.36s)]
*  I like Steve. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=385.52s)]
*  I like first take. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=386.08s)]
*  I'm not, I love to hear his plan. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=387.28s)]
*  If he likes these kinds of things, I think he'd have a better chance of being a politician. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  All right, Dana, you know, the talk of Michelle Obama entering the presidential race was something [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=392.56s)]
*  where everybody said, whoa, in 2024, but she can't even keep a podcast going. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=398.48s)]
*  This was Jesse's favorite topic. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=404.64s)]
*  And I think you still owe me something for that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=406.32s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I bet we bet 100 times. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=409.52s)]
*  I didn't even know Michelle Obama had a brother. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=414.48s)]
*  And now like she's doing a podcast with her brother and it's not getting anywhere. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=417.76s)]
*  Honestly, is she like looking for something to do? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  Here's what the way that she could get attention. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=424.08s)]
*  I came up with this this morning. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=426.08s)]
*  Don't say Mariam. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=427.2s)]
*  I've been thinking about it all day. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=428.0s)]
*  No, that only works for a certain congresswoman. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=428.96s)]
*  Remember Michelle Obama had the hashtag bring back our girls. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=433.44s)]
*  When those girls were kidnapped in Nigeria, she was right to care. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=437.52s)]
*  If she cared about America's girls and women's sports and was willing to say something, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=442.64s)]
*  she would be a hero. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  Take that, Michelle Obama. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=451.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=452.16s)]
*  No, take the idea and run with it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=452.48s)]
*  Do it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=454.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  She should do it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=455.84s)]
*  We want her to do that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=456.64s)]
*  If you care about girls' sports and women's sports, you should do it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=458.16s)]
*  It's too late. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=461.2s)]
*  She missed the boat. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=461.68s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=462.56s)]
*  It is too late. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=464.16s)]
*  It would have been nice. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=464.8s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=465.52s)]
*  It would have been nice. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=466.64s)]
*  She could still do it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=467.36s)]
*  It's too late for everything because she was so hot a year ago. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=468.24s)]
*  Somebody on the Democratic side at a high level needs to come out and say, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=472.16s)]
*  we and that can't be just be a congressman from Massachusetts. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=476.0s)]
*  It should be somebody at a high level who says, we got this wrong. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=478.96s)]
*  It should be Kamala Harris. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=483.2s)]
*  You want a future? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=484.32s)]
*  You do it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=485.2s)]
*  But somebody on that side needs to do something because these girls should not have to basically [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=485.92s)]
*  get to a final in a competition and have to take a knee because they're going to lose to a guy. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=491.44s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=496.24s)]
*  And up next, liberals are trying to cancel John Stamos for going to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=496.96s)]
*  You won't get it anywhere else. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWoPOQBgWY&t=508.88s)]
