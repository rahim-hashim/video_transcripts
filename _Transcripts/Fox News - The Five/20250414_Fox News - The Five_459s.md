# ‘LAUGHABLE’: Tyrus rips apart Bernie Sanders' appearance at Coachella
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE)
*  As Coachella became Burnchella. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=0.0s)]
*  That's right, Bernie Sanders taking the Coachella stage [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  to rant and rave about President Trump and billionaire oligarchs [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=5.4s)]
*  to a crowd of kids who paid at least $600 to be there. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=9.3s)]
*  Feel the Burn and AOC also bringing their socialist message to LA and Utah. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=12.6s)]
*  Now we got a president of the United States who... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=19.8s)]
*  ... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  I agree. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  The future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=28.2s)]
*  We're going to sing and dance our way to victory against hatred and divisiveness. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=35.0s)]
*  An extreme concentration of power, greed and corruption [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=42.2s)]
*  is taking over this country like never before. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=47.2s)]
*  We believe in democracy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=50.8s)]
*  We are not going to let Trump take us into an authoritarian society. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=53.0s)]
*  All right, so Tyrus, I did not see Bernie going to Coachella. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=59.6s)]
*  Why not? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=63.6s)]
*  Why not? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=64.9s)]
*  The cheap, by the way, I hate to disagree with you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=65.5s)]
*  That's a disagreement between you and me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=68.0s)]
*  Sorry, I'm keeping a list. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=69.4s)]
*  What do we have? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=70.7s)]
*  The $600 was the cheap seats. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=71.5s)]
*  That was the cheap seat. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=73.2s)]
*  Those are the cheap seats. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=73.8s)]
*  If you want to sit up close, I believe it was a little more, almost $1,100. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=74.7s)]
*  I think it's amazing that a socialist has a speaking fee, by the way. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=78.3s)]
*  I wonder how much of that money went to the good people of Sanders, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=81.4s)]
*  probably to help build his mansion. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=85.0s)]
*  This is laughable. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=86.9s)]
*  I always, when you are speaking about a wrong, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=88.2s)]
*  you shouldn't have to look down at a piece of paper. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=91.7s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=93.7s)]
*  If you are speaking about injustice, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=94.7s)]
*  I need to, and that's all you need to see, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=98.9s)]
*  is that they are just saying things with no actual facts behind it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=103.7s)]
*  It's not a battle for Gen Z. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=109.6s)]
*  It's common sense versus BS. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=111.3s)]
*  And that's BS. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=114.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders goes out there and tells a bunch of people who can afford to be there [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=115.1s)]
*  how bad their lives are. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=118.5s)]
*  But every one of them can afford $20 Lemonades, $30 cheeseburgers, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=120.7s)]
*  and continue to cheer and have, that's a rough life. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=126.1s)]
*  Those guys were hurting. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=130.0s)]
*  And then you know what the worst part of that night was? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=132.0s)]
*  The long line of valet. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=134.1s)]
*  Unbelievable that they had to wait up to 20 to 45 minutes for their valet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=135.7s)]
*  Times are tough for them right now in America. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=140.89999999999998s)]
*  Where guys, President Trump has capitalized on my favorite thing in the world, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=144.0s)]
*  common sense. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=148.7s)]
*  And when you have common sense, it brings everybody together. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=149.7s)]
*  Why? It's common sense. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=152.1s)]
*  These crowds that they're getting, Dana, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=154.7s)]
*  are these the same crowds Bernie's always gotten for the last 20 years? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=156.2s)]
*  Are these new people? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=160.0s)]
*  Well, some of them are younger than the crowds you used to get, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=162.0s)]
*  but it's the same type, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=164.1s)]
*  So there's always been fringes left and right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=165.2s)]
*  Bernie Sanders probably always could have gotten these crowds. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=167.5s)]
*  He has a following. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  Might be a little bit more than usual because they've got a big promoter [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=171.2s)]
*  and they've got that dark money, you know, that sweet, sweet dark money that's helping. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  But they are also raising money because people are willing to pay [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=177.7s)]
*  what they are doing now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=180.7s)]
*  I think one of the things they'll find though is that the energy they have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=183.0s)]
*  in the Democratic Party that's on the far left, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  that will maybe help for the far left candidates in the primaries [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  that are to come, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=194.7s)]
*  They have now some younger people that are wanting to take on some of the old guard [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=195.7s)]
*  and that kind of energy for younger people who know how to use the phones, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=199.6s)]
*  that can help them win to become the candidate. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=203.89999999999998s)]
*  But I think it will hurt them in the general elections [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=207.0s)]
*  because of the way people have been voting. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=209.7s)]
*  And we saw that just eight months ago in 2024. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=211.5s)]
*  I would also add that the Republicans have all the energy on their side [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=216.2s)]
*  when it comes to the number of young people that voted for Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=222.8s)]
*  And if they can hold on to that for the next election, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=226.8s)]
*  then you have young people voting for your party, the Republicans, in two elections. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=230.5s)]
*  That means that just typically in their life, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=235.4s)]
*  they will probably vote Republican their whole life, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  driving their parents absolutely crazy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=239.9s)]
*  Let's get them. Let's keep it going. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  So moderate Democrats, when they see Bernie and AOC out there getting crowds like this, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  does that make you guys nervous? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  No, but it makes me realize that we forget that politics is about addition. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=251.8s)]
*  It probably would have been better for President Trump to be there [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=257.6s)]
*  and for those people to have been at the UFC. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=260.5s)]
*  I would have preferred to go to the UFC myself [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  because at the end of the day, just speaking over and over and over again [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=265.1s)]
*  to the very people who agree with everything that you agree with, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=268.1s)]
*  doesn't necessarily bring you any more voters when it all gets said and done. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  It would have been interesting to hear Bernie, or Mr. Sanders, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  and the Congresswoman from New York say, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=280.0s)]
*  you know, we believe we should cut taxes and regulations on small businesses. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  We believe that the first $50,000 of earned income on someone [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=286.7s)]
*  should be tax-free, payroll tax-free. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=292.5s)]
*  And in fact, President Trump, we agree with you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=295.2s)]
*  When you brought and had President Zelensky in the office with you [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=296.9s)]
*  and you proposed a rare earth mineral deal, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  probably the greatest thing our country can do to reduce our reliance on China [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=304.2s)]
*  over the next 20 years and going where that puck is going, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=308.4s)]
*  what I was trying to say, Judge, is to make it where China, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=310.9s)]
*  who has threatened us with halting rare earth mineral exports [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=313.9s)]
*  from their country to ours, if we had a deal with Ukraine [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=317.5s)]
*  that stopped Russia and gave us an opportunity to build our economy for the future. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=320.7s)]
*  That's what politics should be about. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=325.5s)]
*  And that's when I'm hoping, whether it's Bernie Sanders [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=327.7s)]
*  or whether it's someone else on my party, that's what we should be talking about. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=330.09999999999997s)]
*  Harold suggested that AOC and Bernie go to a UFC fight, Judge. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=333.7s)]
*  What do you think that entrance would look like? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=338.7s)]
*  I'll go with T. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=340.5s)]
*  I will go. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  I will go in a minute. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=342.09999999999997s)]
*  Here is the difference, okay? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=342.9s)]
*  First of all, you've got two totally different audiences. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=345.0s)]
*  The UFC audience, you've got a lot of blue collar family, working class. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=348.2s)]
*  You've got everyone is, you know, it's family. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  There's people who love a fight. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=356.5s)]
*  And the difference, yeah, not with each other. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=358.7s)]
*  You're right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=362.29999999999995s)]
*  Not with each other, but the difference is the reaction. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump walks in and immediately the place explodes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=365.9s)]
*  And what do they do? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=371.5s)]
*  They start singing and chanting, USA, USA. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  The man doesn't have to, the president doesn't have to get up, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=378.2s)]
*  say one word, try to sell a political message. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oCC9CYVBE&t=381.4s)]
