# Gutfeld: Could Trump’s tariffs be the ultimate ‘testosterone boost?’
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4)
*  Could Trump's tariffs be the ultimate testosterone boost? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=0.0s)]
*  The self-proclaimed Magalufty says yes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  We shipped jobs that gave men who work with their hands for a living [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=5.44s)]
*  and rely on brawn and physicality off to other countries to build up their middle class. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=10.88s)]
*  And then we imported millions and millions of illegals. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=16.96s)]
*  Harold, I guess this is based on the idea that a lot of jobs were manly construction, manufacturing, TV hosts [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=21.16s)]
*  that were then marginalized in this kind of cheap labor economy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=28.48s)]
*  What say you? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=32.32s)]
*  This this idea of bringing back the Norman Rockwell vision of the American workforce, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=35.4s)]
*  I just don't think is what we want. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=41.8s)]
*  You look at the countries where I don't know who the young lady that was speaking there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=43.32s)]
*  But I think I understand her sentiment. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=47.36s)]
*  We want jobs to come back where we build things and we make things and repair things. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  We want to build robots and repair robots. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=53.92s)]
*  We want to ensure that we're building the next generation of medicines and conceptualizing and building out and thinking through. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=55.92s)]
*  We're the most innovative, richest country the world has ever known with the greatest and strongest military ever. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  We've done pretty well. We need to keep doing well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=68.8s)]
*  But let's not pretend that we're not a country of strength. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=70.84s)]
*  Robot Harold is back. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=73.48s)]
*  Judge, so Robot Harold says that the past is dead. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=75.68s)]
*  Forget about the good ways things used to be. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=79.04s)]
*  We can't go back to fairness and a simple life. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=81.68s)]
*  Well, isn't that what Obama said that we didn't have that magic wand for all the manufacturing that's coming back? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=84.64s)]
*  But look, just talk to Mike Rowe. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=90.64s)]
*  You know, you don't need a college degree. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=92.56s)]
*  You can start working with your hands. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=94.64s)]
*  We need to support the farmers and the ranchers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=96.2s)]
*  And, you know, she's some of that is very accurate. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=98.72s)]
*  Jesse, you said in the green room, the crisis in masculinity began with the first male flight attendant. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=102.08s)]
*  Can you elaborate? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=107.84s)]
*  It's stewardess, Greg, and they will always be stewardesses. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  Even if it's a male flight attendant, I still I say stewardess. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=112.48s)]
*  They don't respond. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  That's an artificial stance. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=117.64s)]
*  That's also our hopefully when you sit behind the screen all day, it makes you a woman. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=118.76s)]
*  Studies have shown this studies have shown this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=125.16s)]
*  Building robots like Harold, you are around other guys. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=129.6s)]
*  You're not around H.R. ladies and lawyers. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=132.88s)]
*  What do you do? You estrogen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=136.4s)]
*  Finish, judge. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=137.2s)]
*  You sit behind the screen. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=138.72s)]
*  I just one serious thing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  It reminds me of the book of Coming Apart by Charles Murray that was from several years ago. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=142.76s)]
*  The job thing is one issue for masculinity, but there are many other pieces, including education, religion and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=146.76s)]
*  fathers. You're here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=152.16s)]
*  Yes. Also, if you got a desk job, work shirtless. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=153.36s)]
*  Is that what you do? That's what I do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=157.56s)]
*  That's what you do. I'm coming in earlier. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=158.84s)]
*  These are artificial positions. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_zGMCkbor4&t=160.48000000000002s)]
