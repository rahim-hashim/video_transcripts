# Greg Gutfeld: Team Trump is going to bat for the new tariffs
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8)
*  After decades of other countries treating American trade the way Jerry Nadler treats [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=0.0s)]
*  a buffet, President Trump is not backing down after declaring Liberation Day, sticking up [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=7.32s)]
*  for the American worker, slapping tariffs on 180 countries around the world. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=12.64s)]
*  Even the penguins weren't spared. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Markets taking a dive, but 47 reassuring Americans it'll all be worth it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=19.72s)]
*  The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  the rest of the world wants to see is there any way they can make a deal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=29.44s)]
*  They've taken advantage of us for many, many years. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=33.72s)]
*  For many years we've been at the wrong side of the ball and I'll tell you what, I think [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=36.64s)]
*  it's going to be unbelievable. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=41.68s)]
*  Team Trump going to bat for the new tariffs to bring back jobs. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=44.0s)]
*  What has the globalist economy gotten the United States of America? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=48.34s)]
*  Encouraging a huge amount of debt to buy things that other countries make for us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=51.96s)]
*  It's not a recipe for low prices and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=56.68s)]
*  of America. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=60.6s)]
*  These people have all been living in our house. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=61.6s)]
*  They've been driving our car. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=63.48s)]
*  Korea wouldn't let french fries come in. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=64.72s)]
*  European Union won't take chicken from America. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=67.0s)]
*  They hate our beef because our beef is beautiful and theirs is weak. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=71.8s)]
*  Sit back, take it in, let's see how it goes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=77.24s)]
*  If you retaliate there will be escalation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=80.4s)]
*  If you don't retaliate this is the high water mark. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=83.28s)]
*  If these countries wanted to negotiate, if these countries wanted to do what's right, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=86.32s)]
*  they've had 70 years to do it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Instead they have been ripping off American workers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  He campaigned on the idea of fair trade on tariffs and nearly 80 million Americans elected [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=94.24s)]
*  him to do it and he is delivering. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=100.24s)]
*  And while everyone gets all hot and bothered, this former commerce secretary is reminding [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  folks that tariffs are just the start of a negotiation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=106.22s)]
*  I would assume that this will not be in place in a month, two months. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Probably not in the back half of the year. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=115.64s)]
*  So I'm in the camp that this is the beginning of a big negotiation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=116.64s)]
*  The president has set the stage for what he loves to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=121.36s)]
*  He'll be negotiating every single day for the net for the foreseeable future. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's the key here, Jesse, is that the media doesn't mention this is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=128.68s)]
*  the start of a negotiation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=133.16s)]
*  Tariffs are an underused tool for negotiation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=136.24s)]
*  It's an underrated device, much like the film The Lost Boys. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=138.96s)]
*  Storing? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=143.4s)]
*  Not Val Kilmer? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=145.52s)]
*  Yes, not Val Kilmer. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=146.52s)]
*  God rest his soul. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=147.52s)]
*  So the president is the president of the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=148.52s)]
*  He's not the president of the Chamber of Commerce. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=151.64s)]
*  So if you're a multinational company, all you care about profits and your stock price, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=153.68s)]
*  as you should. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=159.16s)]
*  But the president has bigger things to worry about. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=161.38s)]
*  He cares about workers, he cares about business owners as well, importers and exporters and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=163.88s)]
*  national security. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=169.48s)]
*  And he's not looking at the next quarter or the next quarter. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=171.04s)]
*  He's looking at the next 50 years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=173.92s)]
*  So this is what this is all about. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=176.0s)]
*  He's been ahead of the curve on China. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  He's been ahead of the curve on the border. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=180.6s)]
*  Maybe he's ahead of the curve on trade. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  And it's not like he's freewheeling here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  He has two men, Lutnick and Besant, who have made billions of dollars in international [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=187.56s)]
*  markets. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=192.88s)]
*  Currency markets, energy markets, trade. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=193.88s)]
*  These guys know what they're doing and they are all in. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=197.32s)]
*  If tariffs are so bad, why do other countries have them on our products? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=200.84s)]
*  Why is it okay if they can tariff us but we can't tariff them? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  No one really answers that question. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  There are billions of people, I call them customers, in India and China. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  We can't sell them cars. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=216.08s)]
*  We can't sell rice to Japan. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=218.0s)]
*  We can't sell big, beautiful beef to Australia. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=219.84s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=223.8s)]
*  I think it's an exciting time to be alive. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=225.12s)]
*  We've rewired the entire world in a way we haven't seen in a hundred years. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=239.68s)]
*  And it's great. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=243.88s)]
*  And hopefully it works out. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=245.26s)]
*  I haven't looked at my 401k today. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=246.44s)]
*  I'm going to look at it tomorrow. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=249.36s)]
*  Actually, maybe not. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=250.36s)]
*  I won't look at it for another month. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=251.36s)]
*  But you just, as he said, have to remain calm. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=253.76s)]
*  He ran on this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=256.24s)]
*  He was elected on this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=257.4s)]
*  And every economist has been wrong about his policies. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  So let's just sit back. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=264.42s)]
*  We've already seen energy prices drop. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=265.84s)]
*  Treasury yields are down. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  Mortgage rates have come down. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=269.92s)]
*  If the Fed can lower rates, it's going to bring inflation down. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=271.2s)]
*  And that's what everybody wants. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=274.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=277.0s)]
*  So Harold, I'm going to ask you a stupid question. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=278.0s)]
*  Let's see if you can answer it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=281.2s)]
*  Is there any proof free trade has ever paid off for the American worker? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=282.28s)]
*  It hasn't paid off. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, I'll say this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=289.23999999999995s)]
*  It has in some ways. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  First, I was good to be with. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=291.23999999999995s)]
*  It has in some ways. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  We have the affordability issue free trade has helped to address. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  Free trade helped to improve and ensure that we had the technology innovation capital in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  our country, which we do on the West Coast and other parts of the country. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=304.44s)]
*  I don't dispute what Jesse has said about the core of the problem or even what President [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump has said the core of the problem. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=311.66s)]
*  We have left and Jesse, I thought that a very good job yesterday enumerating some of this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=313.36s)]
*  We have left the middle class behind at a time in which more wealth has been created [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=317.22s)]
*  in our country over the last 25 years than in any country and for that matter per capita [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=321.36s)]
*  anywhere in the world. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  You look at the 10 richest Americans, their net worth would make them the 19th richest [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  country in the world. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=332.0s)]
*  One point eight five trillion dollars is controlled by just 10 people. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=333.94000000000005s)]
*  I don't begrudge anybody being wealthy, but I have to say if we are as upset and the president [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=338.02s)]
*  is disappointed as he sounds and his policies suggest that he is, we have to wonder is that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  a good thing for the economy for that kind of wealth to be concentrated and accumulated [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=348.56s)]
*  in just 10 people? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=352.97999999999996s)]
*  You take the next 20 Americans, you have the 12th biggest country in the world. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=353.97999999999996s)]
*  Let's get back to the points you raised. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=357.85999999999996s)]
*  Our tariffs going after the rich now, Harold. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=359.62s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=361.38s)]
*  But if we are concerned about what's happened hollowing out in cities across the country, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=362.38s)]
*  rural and urban alike, and there's no doubt it's happened, our tariffs and our trade policy, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=366.82s)]
*  the only reason it's happened. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=371.7s)]
*  I don't believe that is the case. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=373.14s)]
*  I think tariffs are part of it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=374.3s)]
*  Terrors could be a small part of it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=376.46s)]
*  But for anybody on today to say that losing almost three trillion dollars in market value [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=377.78s)]
*  and our markets is a good thing, I'd say what are you smoking and what what planet are you [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=382.94s)]
*  on? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=388.02s)]
*  Now, if you told me that three trillion dollars was all transferred to middle class Americans [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=389.02s)]
*  to other to Americans who've been left behind over the last 20 years, I'd say, you know [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=392.74s)]
*  maybe we need another day of it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=396.14s)]
*  The reality is that's not what is happening. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=397.62s)]
*  The people are going to pay more for the things they need the most or the people who the president [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=399.54s)]
*  claims he wants and believes he's helping the most. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=404.1s)]
*  I sure pray, like I said yesterday, I hope tomorrow and I pray tomorrow is a better day. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=406.58s)]
*  But until the president and his team, and I must say this is the savviest, most experienced [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=411.14s)]
*  economics financially savvy team that any president's had in his in his cabinet for [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=416.66s)]
*  them to say that this was OK today. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=421.42s)]
*  Gosh, I can't wait to see what happens tomorrow. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=423.73999999999995s)]
*  They think was today was simply OK. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=425.61999999999995s)]
*  So, Judge, Harold wasn't able to answer the question. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  I did. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=431.38s)]
*  No, you said you didn't say there was any proof that free trade paid for paid off for [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=432.38s)]
*  American workers. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=435.73999999999995s)]
*  You just piled on the race. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=436.73999999999995s)]
*  I said affordability and I said affordability of what the products because they're being [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=437.73999999999995s)]
*  made in Mexico. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=441.78s)]
*  Is that your answer? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=443.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we assemble them here in America, but we make them over there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=444.38s)]
*  That doesn't help American workers, Harold. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=449.17999999999995s)]
*  You disgust me. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=450.85999999999996s)]
*  And now I'm not happy at this table. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=452.1s)]
*  And you know what's interesting about all that is that, you know, when President Trump [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=453.78000000000003s)]
*  first started going after China, after Canada and Mexico, everybody was like, oh, my gosh, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=458.58000000000004s)]
*  there are neighbors, the wonderful people. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=464.7s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=466.38s)]
*  We love the Canadians. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=467.3s)]
*  Well, the truth is China is making cars in Mexico and Canada and not paying a tariff [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=468.82s)]
*  on them and selling them in the United States while they are putting a tariff on our cars. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=476.38s)]
*  Look, you're going to tariff my goods, but I'm going to lay down and let you roll all [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=481.98s)]
*  over me and sell your stuff with virtually no tariff on it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=486.06s)]
*  Enough. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=490.06s)]
*  And this is what Donald Trump ran on and he's delivering. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=491.06s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=493.58s)]
*  I don't really care about my 401k today. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=494.58s)]
*  You know what? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=497.14s)]
*  Not that I can afford it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=498.14s)]
*  Not that it isn't important. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=499.42s)]
*  Not that I'm not at a point in my life when I should be worried about my 401k because [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=500.98s)]
*  I am. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=504.86s)]
*  But this is what I believe. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=505.86s)]
*  I believe in this man. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=507.02s)]
*  And I believe that what we're seeing now with his bringing in a trillion dollars in business [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=508.94s)]
*  and manufacturing and companies moving back to the United States and seeing what we saw [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=514.42s)]
*  during Covid when we couldn't we had all those supply chain problems. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=520.06s)]
*  We couldn't get medicine in this country. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=525.66s)]
*  Other countries were prioritizing themselves before they were sending stuff to us. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=528.18s)]
*  It's about time we recognize we've got to have manufacturing in this country and we [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=532.6999999999999s)]
*  need to bring them to the table. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=537.78s)]
*  And Donald Trump is the only one that can do it because he's got the biggest consumer [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=539.82s)]
*  base in the world. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=543.34s)]
*  He's not afraid of anybody. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=544.82s)]
*  He's to the wall in terms of you know what I mean. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=546.22s)]
*  And at the end it's going to help the working class. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=553.02s)]
*  And who's complaining? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=555.22s)]
*  My last point. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=556.26s)]
*  Who's complaining? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=557.26s)]
*  Wall Street. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=558.26s)]
*  Too bad. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=559.26s)]
*  He's helping the middle class. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=560.26s)]
*  And finally I think it's going to be over this summer. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=562.34s)]
*  All right, Dana. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=564.66s)]
*  We have about 40 seconds for you before we go to. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=565.66s)]
*  I'm a skeptic on tariffs. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=569.38s)]
*  I said it from the beginning. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=570.86s)]
*  I believe I agree with Thomas Sowell who did an interview yesterday at 94 and was more [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=571.86s)]
*  coherent than somebody that we used to know at the in the Oval Office. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  I think we need the permanent tax cuts immediately as soon as we can get them because that would [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=580.9s)]
*  help calm people down. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=585.14s)]
*  But I also think that the goal is right this would lead to higher wages. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=586.14s)]
*  But before you get to higher wages you get higher prices and that leads to higher anxiety. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=589.3s)]
*  A lot of people are in are people that are all across America are also in Wall Street [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=594.0999999999999s)]
*  right now. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=599.42s)]
*  I think we're kind of forgetting. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=600.42s)]
*  Remember one of the reasons that people decided to move manufacturing because the unions were [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=601.42s)]
*  trying to bring the country to its knees. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=605.5s)]
*  We got to go. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  Hey Sean Hannity here. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT67k49imz8&t=607.9399999999999s)]
