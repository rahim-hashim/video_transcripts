# Piers Morgan: This is a roll of the dice
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk)
*  If you're a country seeking tariff relief, Dr. Don is ready to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=0.0s)]
*  While the market suffered from some side effects of taking tariff medicine, President Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=5.84s)]
*  was seeking phenomenal offers and ready to deal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=10.66s)]
*  Vietnam just got their checkup. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  After getting slapped with one of the highest tariff rates, all it took was one phone call. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=16.86s)]
*  And Trump says, Nam is open to having zero tariffs. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=21.28s)]
*  And if you believe Dr. Don is ready to operate on every country, mooching off Uncle Sam. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=25.54s)]
*  But as usual, Democrats in the media are flatlining and taking off their shoes like it's a code [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=30.46s)]
*  blue in the spin room. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=35.62s)]
*  Here is a shoe. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=37.34s)]
*  It's my shoe, right? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=39.68s)]
*  It is made in China. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=41.1s)]
*  You talked about these luxury products. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=43.76s)]
*  They are. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=45.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=46.3s)]
*  But you take your shoe off and see where it's made. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=47.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=48.3s)]
*  Made in China, made in Vietnam. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=49.3s)]
*  This is going to be 34% more expensive. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=50.3s)]
*  Trump has made one of the dumbest decisions he's ever made as president. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=53.22s)]
*  And that's saying a lot. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  What Donald Trump has announced in terms of his tariffs is just plain dumb. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  I began to understand how this is the only guy in America that could bankrupt multiple [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=63.1s)]
*  casinos. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=68.82s)]
*  So what's the recovery plan for the patient? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  Well, more U.S. manufacturing and jobs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=72.94s)]
*  This former auto worker says the tariffs are working and the so-called experts are all [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=76.12s)]
*  wrong. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  Nobody was crying these crocodile tears when they were closing the Mount Road engine plant [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=82.02s)]
*  that Chrysler had in Macomb County or the Romeo engine plant in Romeo, Michigan, in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  Macomb County. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=94.58s)]
*  But all of a sudden, now that we're trying to bring these products back, these components [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=95.88s)]
*  and these vehicles back to the United States, all of a sudden all of the so-called experts [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=100.1s)]
*  are saying it's going to plunge us into recession and be terrible for the economy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=104.78s)]
*  And once upon a time, Democrats used to love tariffs. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=109.9s)]
*  It's also proper for advanced economies like the United States to insist on reciprocity [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  from nations like China that are no longer solely poor countries to make sure that they're [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=120.42s)]
*  providing access to their markets. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  The average U.S. MFM tariff on Chinese goods coming into the United States is 2 percent, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=128.58s)]
*  whereas the average Chinese MFM tariff on U.S. goods going into China is 35 percent. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=135.06s)]
*  Is that reciprocal? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  The fact is that U.S.-China trade is a job loser. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=143.46s)]
*  Well, someone snuck into the country before the tariffs went up. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=148.46s)]
*  Here's Morgan. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=152.9s)]
*  I guess now we're stuck with you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=153.9s)]
*  Well, you might be. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=155.74s)]
*  I mean, you think you're joking. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=157.74s)]
*  I turned 60 on Sunday and I thought that would be the worst thing that happened to me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=159.3s)]
*  Wait, I'm older than you? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=163.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=164.82s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=165.82s)]
*  By how many decades? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=166.82s)]
*  Boy, we are better looking in America. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=167.82s)]
*  What? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=168.82s)]
*  No, I thought that would be the most difficult thing I had to deal with this week. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=169.82s)]
*  And now I discover I'm so poor, having been in America for one week, I may not be able [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  to afford to leave. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=176.5s)]
*  So, Jesse, I thought I'd come and keep on your sofa. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=177.5s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=179.5s)]
*  No, there's no room, Pierce. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=180.5s)]
*  But how do you think this is affecting not just you, because I know it's all about you, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=182.94s)]
*  Pierce, but how do you think it's affecting people in this country? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=186.94s)]
*  And when I say this country, I mean the U.S. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=190.04s)]
*  Well, unlike 99% of people on social media, I am 100% certain I have no idea if this is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  going to work. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=199.46s)]
*  So everyone is either completely sure it's the greatest transformation thing we've ever [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=200.46s)]
*  seen in economic history or a complete and utter disaster. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=204.96s)]
*  And it seems to me, like with a lot of things that Trump does, probably best to just take [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=208.58s)]
*  a beat, wait a bit, see how this plays out, in particular, see how all the countries respond. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=213.78s)]
*  You're already beginning to see some movement with some of these countries racing to do [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  a deal with Trump. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=224.9s)]
*  If enough of them start to do that, you'll see the markets, who are basically like a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  bunch of lemmings running over a cliff at the best of times, they will roll back at [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=230.34s)]
*  the first sign that any of this appears to be working. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  However, and I think it's an important caveat, this is one hell of a roll of a dice, because [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=237.38s)]
*  if you're out there and you're already struggling from a cost of living crisis and you've got [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=242.98s)]
*  savings and maybe you've got some stocks and so on, you are looking at this and you're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=248.18s)]
*  worried, you're concerned for your family, concerned how you're going to afford stuff. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  And I think that Trump has got to look at this very carefully and he's got to pull out [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=257.3s)]
*  the art of the deal in spectacular fashion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=261.46000000000004s)]
*  Now I would just say I wouldn't bet against him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=264.58s)]
*  I look at what he's done with the southern border in two months, which has been a little [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=267.9s)]
*  short of miraculous and he's had hardly any credit for it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=271.82s)]
*  So I'm prepared to give him a little bit of time and a chance. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=275.2s)]
*  I think everybody should to see if this works. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=277.86s)]
*  But if in two months time it's not working, the pain could be pretty enormous and that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=280.62s)]
*  could be presidency threatening. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=285.3s)]
*  So the stakes are high. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=287.38s)]
*  It does look like a gamble to us, Greg, but the president doesn't see it that way at all. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  He seems relaxed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=292.74s)]
*  No, because he, by the way, I mean, he actually said this was going to happen. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=293.74s)]
*  The media acts like it's a big surprise, but he said, yeah, there might be a little, there [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  might be a rough patch at the beginning of the stock market. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  He's like the pilot that says, yeah, you know, it's going to be a little bumpy when we're [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=306.74s)]
*  going up, but then it's going to smooth out and we'll get you home safely. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=311.14s)]
*  The media is the guy that sits next to you and every single thud of turbulence goes, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=314.5s)]
*  we're all going to die. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=320.82s)]
*  It appears is right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=322.38s)]
*  It's like we're only getting a half opinion. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=323.54s)]
*  The half opinion is look at the stock market go down. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=326.3s)]
*  They don't say, well, you know, it goes back up. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=328.98s)]
*  I mean, I know Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi net worth $270 million. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=331.26s)]
*  Since the tariffs, she's lost $7 million or about 2.5%. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=336.22s)]
*  Do you think she's okay? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=340.70000000000005s)]
*  I think so. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=342.18s)]
*  She's going to get that money back in time for Botox season. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=343.18s)]
*  Money moves around and a half opinion is when an idiot tells you it just goes down. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=346.70000000000005s)]
*  For example, I couldn't tell you what the stock market was last week, the week before, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=352.98s)]
*  the week before that, because you don't look at it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=356.74s)]
*  I'm perplexed by the notion that all tariffs are bad when countries put tariffs on our [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=359.1s)]
*  products. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=364.14000000000004s)]
*  It's a tool that is used in specific environments, not all environments. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=365.14s)]
*  Some, for example, if I were to punch Jesse in the face here, that would be bad. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=369.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, you don't beat up. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=375.06s)]
*  What did it? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=376.06s)]
*  Well, for some, you know what? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=377.06s)]
*  You changed my mind. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=378.7s)]
*  But if it were a boxing match, yes. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=380.06s)]
*  So in a boxing match, you don't tell your opponent, hey, the right cross is off the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=382.97999999999996s)]
*  table because he's not going to agree with you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=388.82s)]
*  So in these negotiations, you know, he's using an asset. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=391.64s)]
*  Trump is using an asset that wasn't being used before. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=395.56s)]
*  So he's making again an asset out of nothing. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=398.94s)]
*  And he's introducing it to keep our trading partners off balance. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=401.8s)]
*  So they make a deal on our terms. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=406.28s)]
*  If you look, look at NATO, Greenland, the Panama anal, you know, they all woke up to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=408.53999999999996s)]
*  the Trump alarm clock. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=414.24s)]
*  The best part about this is they start negotiating with themselves first before they even get [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=417.0s)]
*  to the table. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=423.24s)]
*  Trump, we don't even have to lift a finger because uncertainty through action gets people [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=424.24s)]
*  moving in your direction even before you meet them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=429.6s)]
*  It's because it's all beginning at a standstill. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=434.12s)]
*  It's inert. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=437.68s)]
*  You're dealing with inertia. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=438.72s)]
*  So it's already a win. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=439.98s)]
*  We're already getting results. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=441.22s)]
*  Yeah, because Vietnam called and they want to drop their duties down to zero, Katie. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=442.56s)]
*  So that guy's Nikes that he just held up, they're not going to go up at all. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=446.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's because Vietnam needs access to the American market to keep their country [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  afloat, which is why they're calling and asking to negotiate. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=455.12s)]
*  When President Trump made his trip to China in 2017, this was a topic of discussion. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  And I was actually there a week after he was in the country. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=463.48s)]
*  And the number one complaint from the Commerce Department was there's no reciprocity here [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=467.18s)]
*  on anything, not to mention goods. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=473.98s)]
*  We're trying to get into the Chinese market. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=476.62s)]
*  We're not allowed to. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=478.26s)]
*  We're not allowed to send the product without having a tax. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=479.58s)]
*  So this has been an issue that the president addressed in his first term kind of as a test [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=482.72s)]
*  and it worked out fine. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=486.7s)]
*  So now they're going full force with his actual plan for tariffs, which includes a number [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=488.0s)]
*  of things outside of just what you saw happening on Wednesday. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=493.88s)]
*  It's tax cuts, it's deregulation, it's spending cuts. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=497.54s)]
*  And when you look at these Democrats who are like Nancy Pelosi used to believe in exactly [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=501.36s)]
*  what he's saying, it shows that for so many years, they were always willing to talk about [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=505.84s)]
*  this but never willing to take the political risk to actually stand up for the people they [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=510.28s)]
*  said they were going to the mat for. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=514.56s)]
*  I mean, Elizabeth Warren, this is a woman who has said that she's for the workers and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=516.96s)]
*  she's for the little guy and she's for the people who are actually doing the work for [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=521.08s)]
*  the big corporations. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=524.48s)]
*  And yet she's against any of this because Trump is putting his name on it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=526.0s)]
*  When you look at the people who were in the Rose Garden on Wednesday with their hard hats [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=530.1600000000001s)]
*  and their union membership, Elizabeth Warren wasn't there. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=533.36s)]
*  It could have been a great bipartisan event and yet it wasn't. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  Finally, you know, the 401ks and Wall Street, the majority or half of the country is invested [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  in some type of investment. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=546.4000000000001s)]
*  So to say that it's not a big deal that people are looking at their investments, that it's [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=548.24s)]
*  not hurting, people do hedge home purchases, for example, against their investments and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=551.28s)]
*  they're worried. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=556.64s)]
*  However, it's been two days since this was implemented. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=557.64s)]
*  There's a broader picture here for what they have planned. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=561.28s)]
*  So let's see what happens as these world leaders continue to call the White House and try to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=564.0s)]
*  negotiate their rates. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=567.96s)]
*  Yeah, next week, Judge, you could bounce right back. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=569.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=571.96s)]
*  And I think that what Piers was saying when you said it was a roll of the dice and, you [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=572.96s)]
*  know, we don't know whether it's going to work or it's not going to work. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=578.04s)]
*  When you think about the guy who is throwing the dice, OK, you've got a guy who took care [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=581.0s)]
*  of the caliphate in what a few weeks that was driving the world crazy. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=585.7199999999999s)]
*  You've got the southern border, as you say so accurately, is now nobody's crossing the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=589.8s)]
*  border. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=594.1999999999999s)]
*  We got a good job numbers today. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  We now have manufacturing coming back to the United States, a trillion dollars. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=599.06s)]
*  He's gotten foreign investments into this country. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=603.8399999999999s)]
*  So when you start reading all the tea leaves, he's setting up the game. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=606.48s)]
*  Everything is starting to coalesce. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=610.08s)]
*  And just today, what I read out from, you know, Vietnam, he's willing to say, hey, we [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=612.44s)]
*  need you. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=617.12s)]
*  I'm willing to go to zero. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=618.12s)]
*  Jeep and Ram is now selling all of their vehicles to Americans at employee prices. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=620.16s)]
*  Ford is selling vehicles to Americans at employee prices. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=625.8000000000001s)]
*  And then you've got the pausing of the minivans and Jeeps being made in Mexico and Canada [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=630.3s)]
*  because they realize that that's not going to work anymore, that they're going to have [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=637.06s)]
*  to make them in the United States. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=640.78s)]
*  And you know, the uncertainty in the stock market, it isn't necessarily a negative. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=643.06s)]
*  It can be an indication that things are going to work out. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=648.78s)]
*  It's just that things are, they're uncertain right now. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=652.0999999999999s)]
*  And you've got a president swinging for the fences. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=655.5799999999999s)]
*  You've got a president who's punching, as opposed to the other guy who put what, five [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=658.14s)]
*  trillion dollars into the economy and caused inflation. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=662.46s)]
*  This president now has to deal with. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=666.3s)]
*  And the American industry has been getting killed. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=668.68s)]
*  And today we heard about the shrimp industry. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=670.78s)]
*  I didn't know anything about it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=673.26s)]
*  But 94 percent of the shrimp in this country comes from Southeast Asia and Ecuador. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=675.26s)]
*  And they don't have any of the protections. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=680.8199999999999s)]
*  They're parent-raised, farm-raised, illegal hormones, antibiotics, slave trade, all that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=683.02s)]
*  stuff. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=689.5799999999999s)]
*  And yet we keep protecting these other countries, defending them, giving them money. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=690.5799999999999s)]
*  We're basically saying sockets in the face again. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=695.66s)]
*  No more. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=698.1s)]
*  It's time for the American worker to survive. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=699.1s)]
*  No more shrimp dumping. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZjvK-v8Wk&t=702.9s)]
