# 'SCHOOL'S OUT': Trump moves to bring education back to states
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao)
*  The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=0.0s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars for a bunch of failing report cards. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=13.92s)]
*  President Trump signing an EO that takes action to eliminate the Department of Education and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=17.68s)]
*  bringing it back to where it belongs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=22.56s)]
*  The states. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=24.62s)]
*  Hopefully she will be our last Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=26.78s)]
*  We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=31.340000000000003s)]
*  And this is a very popular thing to do. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=37.82s)]
*  But much more importantly, it's a common sense thing to do. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  Teachers to me are among the most important people in this country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=43.74s)]
*  And we're going to take care of our teachers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=48.18000000000001s)]
*  And I don't care if they're in the union or not in the union. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=50.18000000000001s)]
*  That doesn't matter. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=52.74s)]
*  But we're going to take care of our teachers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=55.14s)]
*  And I believe I believe the states will take actually better care of them than they are [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=57.14s)]
*  than they are taking care of right now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=62.74s)]
*  But don't let President Trump alone convince you that the education department is useless. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=65.62s)]
*  Teachers Union boss Randy Weingartner accidentally just did it for him. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=70.26s)]
*  The federal education role is limited. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=75.22s)]
*  There's no except for, you know, the Department of Defense schools, which are not run from [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=79.18s)]
*  the Department of Education or the Bureau of Indian Affairs schools that are not run [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=84.9s)]
*  by the Department of Education. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=89.14s)]
*  It doesn't control any schools. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=91.5s)]
*  In fact, it's the states that control schools. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  So if President Trump doesn't like what's happening in education, it's the states and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=96.62s)]
*  local school boards that do it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=101.62s)]
*  And it's not just the education department that's getting neutered. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=103.92s)]
*  President Trump is also cracking down on woke universities. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  Columbia has until Friday to ban masks and clamp down on anti-Israeli protests on campus. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=110.14s)]
*  Four hundred million in federal funds hangs in the balance. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=116.42s)]
*  And the administration's pausing one hundred and seventy five million dollars in federal [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=120.06s)]
*  funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its transgender athlete policies, forcing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=123.38s)]
*  women to compete with men in sports. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=128.82s)]
*  Gabby, Greg, Republicans have been talking about eliminating the DOE for decades. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=132.58s)]
*  Trump finally did it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=138.06s)]
*  I love the way he did it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=139.86s)]
*  Finally, you can have kids around a president, not worry about getting eaten or sniffed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=141.18s)]
*  I thought it was a nice touch. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  How fitting that getting rid of the Department of Education is a no brainer, because this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=148.26s)]
*  if this were a private company, it would have been it would have gone bankrupt in two years. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=153.54s)]
*  If it was a sports team and posted a losing record every year, it would have folded in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=158.78s)]
*  five years. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  It's in their title. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=166.86s)]
*  Department of Education. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=168.66s)]
*  And if Randy, that's his name, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=169.66s)]
*  If Randy's right, then you shouldn't miss this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=173.26s)]
*  You shouldn't miss this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=176.06s)]
*  If it's like, oh, it has no effect, then great. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=177.22s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=179.26s)]
*  See you later. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=180.26s)]
*  The crackdown on woke universities, if you look at what they're doing, he's targeting [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=181.26s)]
*  behavior that is antithetical to the human experience. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=190.9s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=191.9s)]
*  Men competing as competing against women in women's sports. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=192.9s)]
*  That's absurd. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=195.74s)]
*  I had crackers before I came out here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=197.02s)]
*  And then the aggressive intimidation of Jewish students. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=200.66s)]
*  That's harassment. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=203.54000000000002s)]
*  So he's doing the right thing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=204.74s)]
*  He's getting rid of this stuff. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=206.5s)]
*  But I think there's a bigger failure going on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=207.5s)]
*  And it's one of maturity. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=209.86s)]
*  If you look at the education system, the failure is contagious. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  We are no longer creating people who understand how other people live and they don't even [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  care about their future selves. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=224.26000000000002s)]
*  So when you have a student that goes out and calls a Jewish kid a Nazi and it's filmed, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=226.66s)]
*  that kid is hurt. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  But they also don't think about how does that affect me in the future? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=233.3s)]
*  We've created a new kind of college experience and it's called the tantrum. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=237.66s)]
*  It's what a child does. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=241.94s)]
*  Instead, you're supposed to be kind of enabling or amplifying the maturation process so that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=243.94s)]
*  they can understand that there are other people in the world and that you should respect their [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=250.94s)]
*  private property or their space. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=255.9s)]
*  And you should also think about you in the future. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=257.82s)]
*  How are you going to treat yourself? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=261.82s)]
*  Because everything that you do in college is going to follow you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=263.66s)]
*  And I think a lot of these kids are being steered the wrong way and they're doing stuff [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=267.58s)]
*  that ultimately is going to harm them in the future. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=271.94s)]
*  Everything from college follows you? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=275.14s)]
*  Well, I'm a hypocrite. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=276.7s)]
*  But my bad stuff in college was heavy drinking. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=278.4s)]
*  And we didn't have cell phones back then. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=283.26s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=284.98s)]
*  You would have been dozed years ago. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=285.98s)]
*  Oh my God, I wouldn't be here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=287.98s)]
*  Katie, I like how the president made the point that we love teachers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=289.5s)]
*  Teachers are fantastic. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=292.78s)]
*  They do good work. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  A lot of them are taken advantage of by the teachers union, the bosses. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=295.3s)]
*  And that's important to remember. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=299.16s)]
*  And there are a lot of teachers that are very happy about this move that they'll have more [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=300.4s)]
*  local control of their classrooms, of their curriculum and the money that they can use [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=303.86s)]
*  to do what they think is best for their students considering all the states and school districts [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=308.74s)]
*  are not the same. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=313.34s)]
*  First, A plus to the White House for the optics on this to have all these little kids sitting [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=314.73999999999995s)]
*  around the president in their little ties and dressed up with their desks and then the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=318.82s)]
*  massive Sharpies as big as their head signing at the same time as the president was awesome. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=322.7s)]
*  Love to see that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=327.88s)]
*  But the Republicans and Trump in general have taken the issue of education and turned it [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=329.02s)]
*  into a parental rights issue. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=333.44s)]
*  You've seen this all over the country and they're doing this today with the this mantling [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  of the Department of Education. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=341.02s)]
*  And they're sending it back to the states based on the Trump doctrine of we expect results [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=342.5s)]
*  and you don't get to operate for 45 years and then to have in the year 2025, 70 percent [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  of eighth graders not able to read. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=352.7s)]
*  We're doing something differently. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=355.22s)]
*  We're sending it back to a place where the states can compete against each other for [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=356.66s)]
*  the best programs. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=360.22s)]
*  Arizona, for example, has a great school choice program where parents can use their tax dollars [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=361.38s)]
*  to send their kids to the school that they want to. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=365.74s)]
*  And then internationally, we have to be able to compete. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=368.74s)]
*  We can't compete with China if we're going to not be able to produce students who can [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=371.14s)]
*  read or do math and be successful in their life. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=376.62s)]
*  The education system in America is supposed to help children into the young adulthood [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=379.09999999999997s)]
*  into a successful career and life. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=383.94s)]
*  They are failing to do that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=385.94s)]
*  How big of a role was covid in today? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=388.18s)]
*  A huge role. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=392.38s)]
*  I think covid completely shift the conversation around education. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=393.38s)]
*  And if you look at how which parties trusted more to handle education, Democrats used to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=396.82s)]
*  have a huge advantage and it's basically tied now. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=401.06s)]
*  Sometimes they have a one, two point advantage. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=403.26s)]
*  You saw it obviously in getting Glenn Youngkin in as the governor of Virginia. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=404.98s)]
*  It was huge. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=408.58s)]
*  And that Phil Murphy's re-elected New Jersey was closed because of the covid issue in education. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=409.58s)]
*  So I would never want to minimize it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=414.42s)]
*  But Donald Trump just basically had a photo op today. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=416.58s)]
*  He didn't dismantle the Department of Education. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=420.06s)]
*  It has to be done by an act of Congress. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=421.66s)]
*  And I know that really bumps him out that there are other branches of government. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=423.58s)]
*  She's taken notes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=427.66s)]
*  It's going to be bad. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=429.26000000000005s)]
*  But what he's doing is making life really hard for the DOE to operate. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=431.26000000000005s)]
*  And that's going to have a big effect for sure. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=435.14000000000004s)]
*  Randy Weingarten, and I've said many times, I'm not a tremendous fan of hers. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=437.82000000000005s)]
*  What she is making clear in that interview is that the curriculums are actually set on [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=441.5s)]
*  the state level. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=447.18s)]
*  So when you look at the lowest ranked states for education, least educated places like [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=448.18s)]
*  Arkansas, places like Mississippi, West Virginia run by Republicans, that's on them for that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=452.0s)]
*  It's not on her. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=457.74s)]
*  She's not setting the curriculum. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=458.74s)]
*  What the DOE does and why it was created by Jimmy Carter and why probably you can't get [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=460.02s)]
*  Democrats, at least to vote to abolish it, is that it's a funding and civil rights enforcement [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=464.53999999999996s)]
*  organization. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=468.86s)]
*  And when I hear Republicans out there talking about their plan for education in America, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=470.34s)]
*  I don't hear them talking about making sure disabled kids have access to a public education. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=474.34s)]
*  I don't hear them talking about impoverished kids. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=478.98s)]
*  Because we're against it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=480.98s)]
*  I know you are. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=481.98s)]
*  Thank you for admitting it on such a public forum. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=482.98s)]
*  They want to end up privatizing it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=484.98s)]
*  They want a voucher system, which means that kids who can't get to those schools don't [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  have enough money to, or frankly want to go to public schools, won't have access. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=491.82s)]
*  And they also have all of these religious kooks, like the superintendent of Oklahoma [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=495.46s)]
*  who wants to spend millions of dollars on Bibles for the schools, Trump Bibles, because [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=499.34s)]
*  it's all aggrift. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  They want to make it private. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=505.74s)]
*  They want to make them religious institutions. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=506.78s)]
*  And that goes against what you're supposed to do in America. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=508.96s)]
*  So does it need reform? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=511.62s)]
*  Does it need to be made better 100 percent? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=512.78s)]
*  But come on. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=515.22s)]
*  All the Democrat politicians, Jenny, send their kids to private schools. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=516.62s)]
*  I am going to tell you. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=520.2199999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=521.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=522.2199999999999s)]
*  Number one, we are one nation under God. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=523.2199999999999s)]
*  And don't make a joke about that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=525.02s)]
*  Do you think we should be Trump Bibles in public schools? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=526.5799999999999s)]
*  Number two is the issue that the Department of Education has wasted $100 billion a year. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=529.2199999999999s)]
*  So cut the crap. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=537.62s)]
*  You yourself admit they don't do any education. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=539.3s)]
*  Now, you say that Trump is not dismantling. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=542.06s)]
*  He's already dismantled with Doge. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=545.34s)]
*  And let me make one thing also clear. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=547.98s)]
*  Department of Education was created by an executive order by Jimmy Carter as a payback [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  to the unions. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=555.46s)]
*  Subsequently, Congress came in and created it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=556.7800000000001s)]
*  And we're going to end it the same way with an executive order dismantling it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=559.44s)]
*  Subsequently, subsequently finished by a decision by Congress. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=563.5400000000001s)]
*  Now let's be real clear. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=570.22s)]
*  All of these issues as it relates to Pell grants, special needs, all that stuff is being [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=571.66s)]
*  moved to different departments within Washington. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=577.18s)]
*  They are not being eliminated. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=580.66s)]
*  And don't make it sound like these kids are being forgotten because they're not. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=582.26s)]
*  But if you want to talk about no child left behind, if that's what the Democrat liberals [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=587.4599999999999s)]
*  believe in, that screwed us up and screwed our kids more than anything. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=592.4599999999999s)]
*  Because no kid left behind made sure that every kid passed. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=597.18s)]
*  And now we've got kids who can't even read at eighth grade level because they were passed. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=601.78s)]
*  We have a 19-year-old who graduated with honors who can't read proficiently. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=607.2199999999999s)]
*  All of this Democrat nonsense labelism is for the birds. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=611.8599999999999s)]
*  And let me tell you one more thing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=615.26s)]
*  The Constitution does not guarantee an education. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=617.02s)]
*  It is not a federal right. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  It is not a federal issue. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=622.42s)]
*  It is something that under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution is left to the states. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=624.54s)]
*  The state constitutions have provisions where you have a right to education. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=629.98s)]
*  But this is something that is for parents and for educators, for teachers that we do [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=635.5s)]
*  love. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=641.58s)]
*  We don't love Randi Weingarten and what she did to our kids when she couldn't find one [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=642.58s)]
*  metric in the billions of dollars that we gave her to open the schools to make it safe [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=647.38s)]
*  enough for her and her pals to open up those schools. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=652.5799999999999s)]
*  You know what, Randi, go back to Ukraine for the third time to try to figure out what they're [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=656.18s)]
*  doing in education. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=660.66s)]
*  And let me tell you one more thing. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=662.18s)]
*  I'm not done. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=663.4599999999999s)]
*  One more thing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=664.4599999999999s)]
*  One more thing. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=665.4599999999999s)]
*  Is these kids in China and Russia that were studying quantum physics while our kids were [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=666.4599999999999s)]
*  hiding and doing drugs and alcohol, and the kids in Norway and Denmark and Sweden, we [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=671.98s)]
*  spend more money per kid than any country in the world and we're losing because of the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=677.66s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=682.06s)]
*  And that's the end of that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=683.06s)]
*  Can I just say one more thing since we're going to accuse the Republicans of not caring [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=684.06s)]
*  about disabled kids getting an education or poor kids getting an education. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=687.38s)]
*  The Biden administration threatened to withdraw funding for student lunches if school districts [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=691.06s)]
*  did not force young women to have men in their lock rooms competing with them. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=696.6999999999999s)]
*  So if we want to talk about those types of things, we can. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=700.98s)]
*  But that's not what the president did today. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSSh1ZlUao&t=703.38s)]
