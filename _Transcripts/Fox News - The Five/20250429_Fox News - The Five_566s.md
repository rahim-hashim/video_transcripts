# ‘ALL DEMS HAVE IS HATE’: Judge Jeanine applauds Trump for doing what he was 'elected to do'
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI)
*  Democrats responding to 100 Days of Trump by claiming it's been 100 days of H.E. double hockey sticks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's first 100 days have been 100 days from hell. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=6.28s)]
*  I think if you asked Americans to pick one word that describes Donald Trump's economy and how he's handling it, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  it would be one word, a five-letter word, chaos. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=18.76s)]
*  C-H-A-O-S. Chaos. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=21.2s)]
*  Another five-letter word is Trump. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=25.92s)]
*  T-R-U-M-P. Chaos equals Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=27.6s)]
*  Trump equals chaos. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  Wow, that is a good speechwriter. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=33.52s)]
*  Chuck Schumer taking heat from Democrats for not going hard enough on Trump, but Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker isn't holding back. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=35.68s)]
*  The billionaire Hyatt Haers turned up the heat, saying Republicans cannot know a moment of peace and calling for mass protests against the administration. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  We've got to raise alarm bells to everybody. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=51.64s)]
*  It's a five-alarm fire, everyone. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=54.84s)]
*  It's time to step out of your comfort zone and step out into the streets and speak up and make your voices heard, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=57.0s)]
*  because that's the only thing that we have. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=63.96s)]
*  That's the power that we have. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=66.28s)]
*  And we can stop them in their tracks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=67.84s)]
*  But not all Democrats are trying to be a thorn in Trump's side. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=70.0s)]
*  President Trump was greeted by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer on the tarmac before his rally. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=72.92s)]
*  No bar hiding behind binders. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=77.84s)]
*  She got into the beast with the president and even spoke at his event with the troops. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=79.4s)]
*  Well, I hadn't planned to speak, but on behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and serve so honorably on behalf of the state of Michigan, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=86.96s)]
*  I am really damn happy we're here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  Jessica, let's start with you, because Gretchen Whitmer, a star in the Democratic Party. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=104.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=109.24s)]
*  And now are they friends? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=109.44s)]
*  I don't know if they're friends. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  They have a good working relationship, maybe. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, she did hide behind the folder. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  I think she was joking. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And she's been funny about it since then. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=118.2s)]
*  She knows that she governs a swing state. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  And also, it's an event for the troops. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=123.12s)]
*  What would it say if you wouldn't show up for something like that? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  So and by 2028, a lot will have happened. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=128.24s)]
*  So is she so much better than Pritzker in your mind? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=130.8s)]
*  No, she's not. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=132.96s)]
*  They're both fulfilling different functions. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=134.24s)]
*  And no matter where you fall on the Democratic ideological spectrum, you want to see your elected representatives pushing back. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=136.4s)]
*  That is clear in every single survey. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=144.52s)]
*  And that does not mean violence. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=146.72s)]
*  And he was very clear about that, saying this has to be peaceful protest. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=148.96s)]
*  But there was this one example that I think really showed the power of showing up and marching. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=152.04s)]
*  There was in Sacketts Harbor, New York, which is dairy country, Trump wanted huge margins. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=157.56s)]
*  An undocumented woman, her three children were picked up by ICE, erroneously. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=163.48s)]
*  They actually had a warrant for someone who lived within the same Wi-Fi zone as this family. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=167.96s)]
*  And the town rallied on their behalf. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  A thousand people came out and marched for them, including a lot of Trump supporters. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=175.0s)]
*  And ICE returned them even after Tom Homan had defended the decision. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=178.88s)]
*  So there is power in your voice. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=182.64s)]
*  They were completely peaceful, but they showed that this isn't the way that we do things in America and that innocent people shouldn't be swept up in what they're doing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  So that's the kind of stuff that Pritzker's talking about. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  But Judge, you come from that part of the world, but sounds like I didn't know about this story, but it sounds like it was fixed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And that's the whole point. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=201.32s)]
*  Look, I think Gretchen Whitmer had a chance to set the tone for the Democrats. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=203.72s)]
*  I think that, you know, you say, of course, she's there because of the troops. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  But there are some Democrats who wouldn't be in the same room with Donald Trump. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  Let's not deny that your party's freaked out that much about Donald Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  But I think that she did the right thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=221.76s)]
*  And I think that wanting to work with the president to bring back manufacturing to Michigan is a smart move. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=223.72s)]
*  OK, and, you know, the Dems, you know, like Pritzker, I don't know what his issue is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=231.28s)]
*  He's another white male billionaire that they hate. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=236.24s)]
*  And now, you know, I can't imagine people getting behind him. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=240.24s)]
*  But but I don't understand what's with the Democrats. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=243.68s)]
*  Why wouldn't they be interested in getting men out of women's sports when women are being injured? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=247.24s)]
*  Why wouldn't the Democrats be willing to get Trendy Aragwa and MS-13, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=253.84s)]
*  foreign terrorist organizations who invaded this country out of this country? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=259.36s)]
*  Why wouldn't the Democrats want to protect the American people and make sure that criminals aren't given sanctuary in their cities that they pay taxes on? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=264.44s)]
*  So, you know, I'm kind of tired of hearing about, you know, all of the things that Trump's doing wrong. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=273.92s)]
*  Trump is doing what he was elected to do, and that is to get rid of the illegals who were criminals, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=278.92s)]
*  to close down the border to other people who are trying to come through and to try to solve the economy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=285.04s)]
*  And you know what? If you think he's going to do it in 100 days, then you know, you believe in the in a fairy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=291.24s)]
*  But he can't do it in 100 days. But he's a businessman and he's trying. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=296.92s)]
*  The Democrats, all they have is hate, hate and more hate and lawsuits. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  And the Supreme Court, their lawsuits are so outrageous, the Supreme Court had to come out and say, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=306.64s)]
*  look, you local district court federal judge do not think you have a power equivalent to a president to set foreign policy and get an injunction across the entire United States. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=311.76s)]
*  Democrats, I would get that through their head. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  Greg, when Pritzker says Republicans cannot know a moment of peace, are we supposed to think that he means that you're just going to get Frank calls? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=328.32s)]
*  That's usually what he says before he uses your bathroom. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=337.36s)]
*  Look, I disagree with the judge. I think a lot of people can get behind Pritzker. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=340.52s)]
*  He's calling for a mass protest. I think he can do that on his own. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=346.2s)]
*  He feels the activity in his bones. That could just be the stress from his morbid obesity. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=350.32s)]
*  He's a charlatan. I love Chuck Schumer. I just hope he lives forever. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=355.24s)]
*  So this is his brilliance. Chaos and Trump. Five letters. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=361.04s)]
*  You know what else has five letters? Chuck. His head is so far up his ass. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=366.36s)]
*  He has to communicate through farts. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=372.56s)]
*  Anyway, I get the opposition. The opposition party has to do this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=376.24s)]
*  You're supposed to push back. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=382.04s)]
*  But they've chosen to double down on the hysteria that they already exhausted before Trump won. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=383.2s)]
*  The result is no one's going to hear you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=388.8s)]
*  And the worst part about it is you come out for things that you're against, but you can't articulate what you're for. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=392.36s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like the Dems are like a guy who gets dumped by his girlfriend because he's a jobless, drunken oaf, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=399.56s)]
*  but trashes her new boyfriend because he's boring and has a job. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=407.64s)]
*  And she should take him back even though he's still a drunken, mooching oaf, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=412.08s)]
*  except now he has an acoustic guitar and could sing songs about it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=417.44s)]
*  Van Jones had a little something to say to Democrats this play. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=421.88s)]
*  You need a fire alarm and you need a fire station. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=427.36s)]
*  A fire alarm is somebody can raise the concern level in an appropriate way. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=430.12s)]
*  You also need a fire station. Who's going to put out this fire? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=435.64000000000004s)]
*  The opposition is important. What's the proposition? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  What are Democrats offering besides, you know, outrated Donald Trump and Elon Musk? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=440.8s)]
*  That has to be worked out. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=446.04s)]
*  Anybody listening to him? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=447.56s)]
*  No, they should listen to what happened in the second Punic War, Dana. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=448.8s)]
*  Judge was there. She remembers. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=453.12s)]
*  Oh, why, Jesse? Why? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=454.68s)]
*  Hannibal was closing in on Rome. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=456.36s)]
*  He had just crossed over the Alps and was wreaking havoc. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=459.56s)]
*  He was relentless. He was ruthless. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=462.16s)]
*  And he was setting the pace and the tempo. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=464.0s)]
*  And so they had an emergency Senate hearing in Rome and they say we need a new strategy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=466.4s)]
*  And so Scipio Africanus came up with a new strategy. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=471.12s)]
*  They are going to take the fight to Hannibal in his own territory. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=474.96s)]
*  One hundred and twenty ships set sail with 30,000 Roman legions from Sicily to North Africa. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=481.08s)]
*  And they just ravaged Carthage. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=486.72s)]
*  The Carthage Senate recalled Hannibal back to North Africa. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui3FdCS6efI&t=489.28s)]
