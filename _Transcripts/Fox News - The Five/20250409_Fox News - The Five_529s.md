# ‘The Five’: ‘Soaring eagle’ Trump is ‘running circles’ around Dems
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk)
*  Even CNN is admitting that President Trump is running circles around the Democrats [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=0.0s)]
*  who can't keep up with his record pace of executive orders. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=4.8s)]
*  I think there was this concern among some folks that Donald Trump would come in for a second [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=8.96s)]
*  term and kind of be a lame duck. He ain't no lame duck. If anything, he's a soaring eagle. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  What am I talking about here? Let's talk about Trump executive orders in 2025. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=17.52s)]
*  He's already signed 111 so far. That is the most at this point in a presidency and at least [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=21.76s)]
*  a hundred years. Dems just can't keep up with soaring eagle Trump and now something purging the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=28.88s)]
*  older lawmakers out of their party could help their chances. According to Politico, a new wave [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=35.84s)]
*  of Democratic primary challengers are trying to turn the midterms into a referendum on age and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  complacency in their party's ranks. But it's not just lawmakers they should be concerned with. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=47.84s)]
*  This Gen Z are noticing a lot of the hands-off protesters were old fogies. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=53.68s)]
*  Where the f*** is Gen Z? These people are cheering. They're talking like it's just the 60s. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=60.72s)]
*  It's just like the 60s and they're having conversations and walking slowly. There's no [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=66.8s)]
*  fight here. There's no youth here. It's all 30-somethings and their children and then [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=71.76s)]
*  seniors and God bless everybody who showed up today but I'm really disappointed in the youth [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  turnout. Where is the youth turnout? It's just your future that is going to be impacted by the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=82.24s)]
*  actions of the Trump administration. All right Greg. Did you just say the 30-somethings were old? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=86.8s)]
*  With their children. That changes everything. Yeah I do think it I don't think it's even about [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=94.08s)]
*  age. I think it's we've talked about authenticity before. You can't trust the Dems because they're [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  always code switching. You know they one minute they're condemning oligarchs the next minute [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=104.56s)]
*  they're defending the top 10 percent. They're all about the stock market. They switch or affect [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=108.64s)]
*  dialects depending on the audience that they're talking about. That's not happening with Trump. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=114.16s)]
*  You know Trump is Trump whether he's in the boardroom or at the McDonald's takeout window [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=118.88s)]
*  or in a dump truck you know. There's no like oh he's that's that's Trump over there blah blah blah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=123.44s)]
*  The younger generation gravitates towards Trump and I've talked to people with kids in college [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=130.08s)]
*  and it's a fact he's a folk hero to a lot of people. They like him because he's viewed with [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=135.84s)]
*  hysterical rage by the people they find comical. Whether you know you're in high school it's a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=142.08s)]
*  guidance counselor or it's your liberal professor. They think it's funny that he makes them crazy [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=147.68s)]
*  and I guess it's like the flip of you know what it was like in the 60s where you know [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=153.76s)]
*  the you had the the the button down you know pope pope pipe smoking professor who gets all up tight [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=158.8s)]
*  because you like rock music and protests against the war. The left the boomers became the establishment [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  and now you have this anti-establishment character Trump. He may not be the age that you'd expect [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  him to be but he certainly is the is the personality. He reminds me of how beloved Rodney Dangerfield was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=179.84s)]
*  in Back to School. You know he was a character that went back to college a rich guy and everybody [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=187.36s)]
*  didn't matter how old he was he was just fun. Yeah. Jessica how do you explain Harry Enton saying [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  that Trump is a soaring eagle not a lame duck? Well there was another Harry Enton segment a little [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  bit later where he said that Trump's economic approval it's the worst ever for a president at [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  this point. So that feels kind of ostrich. Was the soaring eagle that he's signing so many executive [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=215.36s)]
*  orders so soaring eagle in terms of not wanting to deal with Congress and wanting as much executive [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  power as possible but the thing that really matters and that got elected him elected was how he was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=225.68s)]
*  going to manage the economy and that's in the toilet so that's fallen 20 points since inauguration. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=231.12s)]
*  Majorities oppose tariffs 70 70 percent say that they're going to raise prices on us which is how [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  tariffs work. Is the economy in the toilet? A little bit. Like what what's your how many variables [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=242.4s)]
*  are you looking at? Are you just looking at the stock market? No I think it does matter that we've lost [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=247.84s)]
*  trillions. Are you looking at inflation the price of eggs or guess because I always love how lives [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  now use the stock market as the single variable for the economy. No it's not the single variable. Flip. I think that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=256.96s)]
*  when you have people from small business owners to huge investors that were backing Donald Trump in [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=262.72s)]
*  the election very publicly coming out and saying that what he's doing is crazy. I can't use the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=268.96s)]
*  expletive that Ken Langone for instance used but I think that he knows what's going to be good for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  Main Street. When you have Walmart coming out and say they can't even do their normal economic [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  forecasting because of the impact of these tariffs and that's why it's so important to note the fact [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=282.4s)]
*  that he took off some of the retaliatory tariffs but he still has this 10 percent baseline tariff [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=287.76s)]
*  which will jack up prices. Right now we have clarity on the stock market. No we don't. That's the difference. We have [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=293.04s)]
*  clarity now. Yes today was a rebound day and whoever saw his tweet and got in there and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  bought in the dip you know god bless you I saw someone when invested 1.3 million and made 33 [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=307.04s)]
*  million dollars in a couple of minutes off of it but this is a Main Street and a Wall Street problem. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=312.72s)]
*  Yeah all right Jessie do you want to respond to that? She's just a panicking. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=319.04s)]
*  You heard what he said. Sit back and be cool Jessica. You can't get so freaked out. Tell a small [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=323.44s)]
*  business owner to be cool. Jessica I'm telling you to be cool. No I'm telling these small business [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=329.92s)]
*  owners I'll be around Sunday and I'll buy the whole place up. Really? Yes Jessica relax. He's doing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  something that needed to be done. It's a little bit crazy right now but it'll end up good in the long [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=341.12s)]
*  run. We've talked about this all week you haven't been here. Money is power but you know being more [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=346.56s)]
*  important than that is political power and Trump understands money because he's made a lot of it [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=352.96s)]
*  and he has political power. You could say peak political power now and he's combined the two and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=359.2s)]
*  he's exercising it in a way that I've never seen before. Benjamin Disraeli he was the prime minister [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=364.48s)]
*  of Great Britain happened to be Jewish. Jessica the very best people. He says power has only one [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=371.6s)]
*  duty to secure the social welfare of the people and when you look at the way Donald Trump exercises [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=378.8s)]
*  his power he's really focused on the welfare of the people whether that's securing the border, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  keeping the streets safe, making sure that we have Greenland for instance. That's about the social [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=389.92s)]
*  welfare. Today Jessica he's having this meeting I believe Gretch was there what do you call her? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  Big Gretch. We do. And for the last 15 years all of these politicians have been trying to rid [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=400.96s)]
*  Lake Michigan of this Asian carp an invasive species which is destroying the lake. It happens [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=408.23999999999995s)]
*  to be the 20 percent of the fresh body of water in the world. It wasn't zebra mussels. Zebra mussels [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  are also a problem. Biden didn't do it. Obama didn't do it. He did it. He spent the money and he did it [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=421.28s)]
*  and Big Gretch was there to thank him. You know why Jessica? He's problem solving and that's the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=428.32s)]
*  bottom line and that's why young Democrats are mad at their old fogies because they had power just [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=434.32s)]
*  a little while ago and they squandered it. They spent trillions and they have nothing to show for [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=439.44s)]
*  it. And you know Dana along with that you've got they've got this age issue with the leadership [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=445.36s)]
*  the Democrats and they're they're upset with Pelosi and Schumer and all of them so are they [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=451.6s)]
*  going to call George Clooney for an op-ed piece? Well I think they'll probably call him for money [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=457.68s)]
*  and one of the problems for the Democrats is that a lot of the progressives that are going to challenge [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  these old guard are very far left okay and they could win and then what does that do for them [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=468.16s)]
*  right so that's a problem for them in the general elections maybe not in a safe seat like Pelosi but [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=475.12s)]
*  yeah that is an issue and then I read it I can't remember the kid's name he's 23 years old I think [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=479.92s)]
*  he's 23 might even be younger he dropped out of college because he figured out how to do online [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=485.6s)]
*  fundraising and all the strategic messaging for Democrats and he has been making a ton of money [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  do you know what I'm talking about he says young it's not act blue kid it's like another guy and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=496.72s)]
*  what that young woman said it's like where are all the young people the young people aren't going to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=501.36s)]
*  go to the street the young people are online and that's where President Trump found the young [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=504.56s)]
*  people that support him as well so they can battle it out there online while the older people [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=508.88s)]
*  are like living their dream of the 60s on the streets that is such a great point well thanks [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PXsR9Nbk&t=513.2s)]
