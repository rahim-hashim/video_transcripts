# Elon Musk offers advice to young people #shorts #elonmusk #fox #news #foxnews #politics #leadership
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg)
*  I've noticed in the past you seem incapable of being risk-averse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=0.0s)]
*  If you see something you want to try, you try it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=5.68s)]
*  And so I'm wondering what kind of advice would you give to a young person whose fear of failure [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=8.56s)]
*  keeps them from taking risks that would actually enrich their lives, whether it's career or [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  personal life. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=18.92s)]
*  And my next question is, when the hell are you doing my show? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=20.28s)]
*  I left voicemail messages. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=25.16s)]
*  I've sent carrier pigeons. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=27.68s)]
*  I get no response. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=29.24s)]
*  Well, I'll be happy to do your show. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=33.08s)]
*  I actually, I've actually I've seen pieces of your show and it's very funny. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=34.56s)]
*  Actually, it's my style of humor. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=44.0s)]
*  So I look forward to doing your show. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=45.12s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=47.84s)]
*  With respect to what to tell young people, I think it's it's always good when thinking [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=48.84s)]
*  about something that you're afraid of. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  When thinking about fear, look fear straight in the eye and it will disappear. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=57.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=64.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=65.84s)]
*  The nature of fear is that people don't look at it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=66.84s)]
*  Look at it directly and it will be gone. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSuepHv4Eg&t=71.04s)]
