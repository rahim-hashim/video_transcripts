# Dems are ’suppressing’ information: Watters
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c)
*  That's great new song. All right. Doge is getting ready to root out more government waste at places like the IRS [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=0.0s)]
*  There's also a plan to audit the gold at Fort Knox [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=5.24s)]
*  This is the left attempts to go nationwide to keep them on a short leash today [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=7.84s)]
*  Anti-musk organizers tried to hold 50 rallies in 50 states, but it wasn't just the streets anti-doge grievances also hitting the airwaves watch [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  I just like you to show that you give a damn that you got a little emotion about the fact that people are losing their jobs [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=21.6s)]
*  Indiscriminately just like to see somebody wake the hell up and get excited about the fact that your country is under assault [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=30.02s)]
*  They're bare. They're not at the gate anymore. They're in your bedrooms. They're in your living rooms. They're in your businesses [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=36.74s)]
*  They're got they got your data done. They got all your stuff [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=44.4s)]
*  Elon Musk has his tentacles and everything you're doing and nobody seems to give a damn [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  So that's all I want somebody to show that they care enough to get out there and say something about it [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=53.739999999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to remember that anyone ever got that passionate about mass layoffs that like in the automotive industry [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=62.9s)]
*  in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=69.14s)]
*  Financial services Jesse. Well, I remember when the Keystone pipeline workers got shelved. No one cried [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  They said learn to code or all those guys that were working for the US military were fired for not getting vaccinated [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=75.06s)]
*  Or all the black Americans who lost their jobs to migrants [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=81.34s)]
*  No one cared but some people got an eight-month buyout [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=84.58s)]
*  Severance package with full benefits. It's not really the same Dana. We are waging a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=90.14s)]
*  21st century [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=95.86s)]
*  information work and warfare campaign against the left and they are using tactics from the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=97.74s)]
*  1990s they are holding tiny press conferences tiny little rallies. They're screaming into the ether on MSNBC [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=103.06s)]
*  This is what you call top-down [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=110.5s)]
*  Command-and-control you get your talking points from a newspaper and you put it on the broadcast network and then it disappears [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=112.58s)]
*  What you're seeing on the right is asymmetrical. It's like grassroots guerrilla warfare [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=119.9s)]
*  Someone says something on social media musk retweets it Rogan [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=124.78s)]
*  Podcasts it Fox broadcasts it and by the time it reaches everybody millions of people have seen it [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=129.82s)]
*  It's free money and we're actually talking about [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=135.82s)]
*  expressing information they are [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=140.18s)]
*  Suppressing information if you watch CBS News, they don't even talk about the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=143.02s)]
*  Scandals that the money is going to Sri Lankan transgenders are getting electric cars. It's costing millions of dollars [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=148.98s)]
*  They don't tell you about that. We tell you about it. It's colorful. It's witty. It's interesting and it goes viral [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=156.94s)]
*  That's the difference they are late to the game and there's no way they're catching up [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=163.9s)]
*  What you did a little deep dive today on Fort Knox that I did the interesting thing about Fort Knox is that the K is silent [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=168.42s)]
*  Did you know that KNOX and K stands for Krugerrand [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=177.82s)]
*  Which suggests that perhaps there's less gold in Fort Knox than you think, you know, Fort Knox is evil in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=182.5s)]
*  1933 Jesse a few years before you were born FDR declared private ownership of gold to be illegal and then took it under the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  Threat of imprisonment. That was our goal [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=197.12s)]
*  We didn't steal it from the Indians the way it was supposed to be it was stolen from us [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=199.16s)]
*  And then a year later he doubled the price of the gold and since that it has been audited since [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=203.8s)]
*  1953 148 million Troy ounces of gold and we don't know if it's actually there [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=209.68s)]
*  What if it's not there at all? I know what if it's I don't know what if dr. Phil has it? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=215.98s)]
*  I have no idea poor Michael Steele if he doesn't do that every day. He doesn't have a job [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=220.94s)]
*  He's the guy you go to for the exploding head move. He's like that stress ball [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  You know the stress ball you squeeze the little things pop out of the ears [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=232.38s)]
*  He has to do that every day because he used to be the former RNC chair [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=235.42s)]
*  14 years ago and he became the former RNC [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  Chair back then and he's been milking that ever since it's not relevant [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  It's as relevant as saying Ted Bundy was a Boy Scout. He was believe it or not. I even did research on that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=250.54s)]
*  What's hilarious about the protests and then I'll shut up. Although people want me to keep talking [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=256.58s)]
*  Those protests are the same exact game plan that is used by USAID and other countries [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=261.06s)]
*  Which is to undermine foreign countries with the or the sitting governments in those countries by creating [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=266.14s)]
*  Discontent, you know, you know [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=272.74s)]
*  They're funding it because the people shouting the loudest are the ones who are on the payroll [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=274.38s)]
*  The protest really is no different than a guy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=279.5s)]
*  Screaming at a cop because he wants to look through the back of his car because he could smell the pot in the booze [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  judge the president won a case today with the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=287.38s)]
*  the courts the judicial branch is saying [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=292.38s)]
*  The president as the head of the executive branch has the authority to do what he's doing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  Presidents do it all the time everyone in the executive [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=299.82s)]
*  Branch of government is the same as Elon Musk. They're not elected [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=303.7s)]
*  There is something called a special government employee and the special government employee. There are thousands of them [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=307.94s)]
*  They were advisors. There's their experts their consultants [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=315.06s)]
*  These are people that the the the POTUS the president [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=318.9s)]
*  Appoints and they have to be permitted to do their jobs and what cracks me up about Michael Steele [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  Is he saying show that you give a damn? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=327.74s)]
*  well [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=330.62s)]
*  they did they voted for Donald Trump because they cared about the border in their pocket and they cared about crime and they cared about [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=331.1s)]
*  Inflation and then he says they got your data you dumb a SS [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=338.38s)]
*  Well, so did Clapper when he testified before Congress and said well [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=342.66s)]
*  We don't really spy on Americans and then shifts his eye to the left and says well not wittingly [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=347.62s)]
*  You know [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  His outrage is so misplaced and it's simply an example of their attempt to maintain political power [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=354.78s)]
*  It's not about the American people. It's not about us [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=361.82s)]
*  It's about their maintaining their power and I just have two more points to make now [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=365.02s)]
*  they're going into the IRS and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=369.36s)]
*  The IRS has a system and Jesse you talked about antiquated systems the IRS system [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=372.14s)]
*  I think was built in the 60s and it is so [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=377.92s)]
*  Antiquated that their IT system has failed all the fraud [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=381.74s)]
*  That they have that they have since identified and Lois Lerner unfair targeted unfairly targeted [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=386.94s)]
*  501 c3s that were conservatives and nothing happened to her, you know, that's what happens on the left [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=393.97999999999996s)]
*  We just forgive everybody on the left if they can do something wrong [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's not gonna happen anymore because with Elon Musk they're identifying crazy things like NIH [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  National Institute of Health you say you can't cut back on that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=410.62s)]
*  You can't let people go and the bottom line is they've got studies on the effect of meditation on parents [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=413.86s)]
*  It's all waste and fraud so that they can keep jobs when they're not in power, right? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=419.98s)]
*  It's like some of these things Jessica you could say well [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=425.21999999999997s)]
*  Maybe they are worthwhile programs [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=427.7s)]
*  But do they need to be paid for by federal dollars and the debt whoever the next Democratic president is in the future if Doge is [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=430.1s)]
*  even slightly successful [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=436.26s)]
*  The new the government will be leaner [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=438.42s)]
*  There'll be less waste fraud and abuse and they could do more with what they have totally and I think [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  Michael Seale was talking about elected officials from the Democratic Party. He wasn't yelling about rank-and-file Democrats [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=444.58s)]
*  He was basically saying to the party infrastructure [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  You're doing this all wrong [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=454.82s)]
*  Like having rallies in Washington DC is not getting the message out about what the real implications of these cuts are and yeah [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=455.94s)]
*  Whatever Jesse says I mean maybe we'll find out next week that it's you know as true as the condoms to Gaza [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=463.06s)]
*  But there's real stuff and stories [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=469.02s)]
*  Cool I did okay, so he made that up don't bother fact-checking it. It was made up [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=472.66s)]
*  You need to talk about the 3400 [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=478.46s)]
*  People from the fire service that were fired for instance [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=481.62s)]
*  I mean [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=484.38s)]
*  Donald Trump was out in California talking about how we need more people working on this that you need to be raking the leaves [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=485.1s)]
*  Then we're firing people there are 57% of the land in California is run by the federal government. So you need to do that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  Firing these disease detectives when we have measles outbreaks [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  You could talk about that go out to your home constituents and talk about that the nuclear weapons workers that were fired [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  And then they had to get rehired because that was a mistake or even on a day like today and I understand that the plane [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=507.76s)]
*  Flipped over in Canada that they're firing air traffic controllers, and they're showing no cause not based on performance or conduct [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=514.0400000000001s)]
*  For doing that they did it Friday night on Valentine's Day at 7 p.m. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=521.48s)]
*  So you talk about the best day of the year [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=524.76s)]
*  No, but those are real stories that are affecting Americans on the ground [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=528.5200000000001s)]
*  All right up next vice president JD Vance ripping into CBS host Margaret Brennan for linking the Holocaust to free speech of all things [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=533.0s)]
*  You [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHxxle_Z8c&t=543.2s)]
