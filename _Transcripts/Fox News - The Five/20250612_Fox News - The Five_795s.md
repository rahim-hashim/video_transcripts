# 'The Five' on Dem crashers to 'WATCH OUT' for
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc)
*  Anti-ice insanity erupting in 21 cities and a Christy Noem presser. A shocking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=0.0s)]
*  scene in Los Angeles as California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla barged [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=6.24s)]
*  his way into DHS Secretary Christy Noem's news conference on the LA riots, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=10.56s)]
*  only to be forcefully removed and handcuffed while on the floor. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=15.6s)]
*  Hands up! I'm Senator Alex Padilla. I have questions for the Secretary because the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=19.44s)]
*  fact of the matter is a half a dozen violent criminals that you're rotating [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=27.04s)]
*  on your [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=31.68s)]
*  hands on your back [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=45.68s)]
*  well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=57.92s)]
*  Senator Padilla and Secretary Noem met afterwards for 15 minutes. They swapped [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=59.92s)]
*  phone numbers and it was cordial and beneficial. Here's what they had to say. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=64.96s)]
*  Are you physically hurt Senator Padilla? Let's come to the microphone please. Okay. If this is how [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=70.16s)]
*  this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=74.56s)]
*  Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they're doing to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=81.92s)]
*  farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers. If he had requested a meeting I would have loved to have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=91.52s)]
*  sat down and had a conversation with him that coming into a press conference like this is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=98.0s)]
*  political theater. And Padilla wasn't the only showboating Democrat today. Blue State Governors Tim [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=102.56s)]
*  Waltz, J.B. Pritzker, and Kathy Hochul were on Capitol Hill as Republicans hammered their state [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=108.88s)]
*  sanctuary policies and refusal to deport dangerous illegals. He found a sleeping woman on the subway, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=114.96s)]
*  lit her on fire, and burned her alive. This is in Kathy Hochul's New York. These crimes are horrific. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=122.72s)]
*  Because of your sanctuary state policies. I don't know how many hearings we're gonna have about the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=130.72s)]
*  fact that there's been this one immigrant that killed this one person. People can't afford basic [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=136.32s)]
*  needs and you're ripping our loved ones away from us because you don't have the courage to fix our [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=141.28s)]
*  broken immigration system. All right, Greg Gutfeld, I want to go to Senator Padilla. The DHS called it [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=147.04s)]
*  theater, right? They said that he didn't identify himself. He had no senator pin. He forcefully [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=155.44s)]
*  lunged. Would you describe this as a stunt by the senator? I don't know. Do we have to keep [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=161.28s)]
*  reminding Democrats that Trump was nearly killed 11 months ago? It was a fraction of an inch away [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=167.6s)]
*  from death and it's like they still don't take that seriously. They spent more time on Elon Musk's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=174.64s)]
*  salute. Do you remember that? So this douche thinks he can plow in after his party spent, I don't know, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=179.6s)]
*  how many years demonizing Trump and by extension supporters and his cabinet. You know, you don't [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=185.76s)]
*  know what security is going to do. He was lucky he wasn't flattened and if they had acted differently, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=191.04s)]
*  who knows what would have happened? I don't know who that guy is. Maybe they didn't know who that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  guy was. If they didn't act correctly, they could have lost their jobs. But Padilla, Padilla, Padilla [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=201.04s)]
*  shows why you need order and grown-ups. This is a microcosm. Some guy bursts into a presser [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=206.64s)]
*  shouting, expects to be treated preferentially. He expected his invasion to be allowed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=213.76s)]
*  What does that sound like? Their policy with illegal criminals. He just represented that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=221.04s)]
*  You will see that video more than you will see the riots that the media denies. It'll be all [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=226.0s)]
*  over the place, which means we should treat it just the way the legacy media treats the riots. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  That was basically a mostly peaceful hug, you know? And by the way, whatever he would say, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=236.16s)]
*  Gavin Newsom tweets, if you handcuff a U.S. senator, what will they do to like citizens? Dude, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  I would assume the same thing because according to you idiots, no one is above the law. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=249.36s)]
*  Then can I just touch on the hearings? Watching Stefanik eviscerate Hokel, this is where [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=254.4s)]
*  responsibility meets virtue signaling. And for so long, it required no responsibility. All you had [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=261.68s)]
*  to say was sanctuary city because you didn't have to live it. Now people lived it. Hokel had no [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  defense at all because she had no defense. What are you going to say? Yeah, I didn't have a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=274.72s)]
*  sanctuary city. How can the Dems not see that their policies and their beliefs made Trump's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  presidency inevitable? You know, MAGA didn't just elect Trump, Democrats did. You know, by the way, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=285.12s)]
*  Senator Padilla was supposed to play first base at the congressional baseball game, but then he flew [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=292.16s)]
*  back to L.A. to do this. And as everyone's Central Park softball league resident catcher, you don't [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  abandon your post. All right. You don't even get to first base. All right, Jesse, the media coverage [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=302.56s)]
*  over the hearings today called it a it devolved over the treatment of immigrants. But isn't the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=309.36s)]
*  point that it's actually about the treatment of laws, i.e. ignoring them and the treatment of law [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=315.2s)]
*  enforcement, i.e. blatant obstruction and assaulting them and the treatment of citizens, i.e. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=320.24s)]
*  deprioritizing them and putting them in danger. Like as always, the media totally misses the point. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=325.28s)]
*  Say i.e. one more time. I counted three. I.e. i.e. How about that? Yeah, the hearings didn't go well today for the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=330.24s)]
*  Democrats. It's just a bad day for the Democrats. They just are such a bad party. I'm not even taking [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=337.12s)]
*  them seriously anymore. Real men do not let their emotions take over them, okay? This is what Code [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=344.0s)]
*  Pink does, Jessica. They run and they scream and they cause a scene. Real men don't almost cry at [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=352.48s)]
*  a press conference when they just bum rushed a woman. And Greg's right. He didn't seem like a senator. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=359.6s)]
*  He seemed like a crazy man impersonating a senator. No one knows who Alex Padilla is. Is his name Alex? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=366.72s)]
*  No one knows who this guy is. He's not Federman. He's not Lindsey Graham. No one recognized him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's the junior senator from California. Let's make way. He's a nobody. He's a no name. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  And these police officers didn't know who he was because he wasn't even wearing his little [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=385.44s)]
*  senate badge. He wasn't in a suit. This was a stunt. Some would call it gonzo journalism. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  Some would say I pulled similar stunts for the factor. And I did because I was a stupid [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=397.12s)]
*  producer, not a senator. These guys are supposed to move the masses with eloquent words and great [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=402.8s)]
*  uplifting speeches or they could legislate and they could make it illegal to break into the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=410.16s)]
*  country. So why don't they just do that and drop the nonsense? This guy is doing it because his base [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  is furious that they don't look like they're doing anything. So he has to show the base he's a fighter [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  and he's doing it for attention to raise cash. And then he's trying to frame Trump as a dictator [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  because then Trump's guys put him in handcuffs and he's like, oh my God, I'm a political prisoner. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  And then everybody says, wow, Trump's really Hitler. And then they shoot him in the head again. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=439.04s)]
*  That's what the end result of this is going to be. Jessica, first of all, I love that the two [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=444.0s)]
*  Jessies are twins. That's so cute. You guys started out even coordinated, united, united. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=448.8s)]
*  All right, Jessica. So here's a couple of quotes. So Newsom said, outrageous and shameful. Schumer [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  sickened. Your boy reps Swalwell said they are terrorizing our community. And the irony to me [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=461.12s)]
*  is that these guys were talking about the Senator Padilla situation and ICE. But when I hear those [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=466.72s)]
*  phrases, I would think they would be talking about throwing Molotov cocktails at law enforcement [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  vehicles or shooting fireworks at the heads of ICE agents. But they're not. Why are they directing [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=476.56s)]
*  their outrage at the ICE agents and enforcement of laws rather than those who are destroying them? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=481.6s)]
*  Well, they did speak out about the Molotov cocktails, especially the Boulder incident from [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  a week and a half ago or whenever it was. So I don't think those are really fair comparisons. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=493.68s)]
*  And Jesse says this is a bad day for Democrats. And I would argue that this is a cataclysmic day [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=500.16s)]
*  for the Trump administration and their immigration policy, because it turns out that Donald Trump [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=506.48s)]
*  agrees with Democrats about immigration policy. He started out the day on Truth Social saying, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=510.16s)]
*  oh, the people who work in hotel and leisure, they have some very good people that are working [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=515.28s)]
*  for them. They're very hard working. And he knows that because he employed a lot of illegals to work [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=519.6s)]
*  at his clubs, like at Bedminster. And he says, well, we should leave those people. We don't want to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=524.4s)]
*  push them out of their jobs. And then he finishes up the day. He does a press conference and he [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=528.88s)]
*  expands because I guess he heard from his friends in big ag. Is that what we call it? The agriculture [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  folks who said hands off our farm laborers. Maybe you should stop going to job sites and picking [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=537.2s)]
*  people up who come and do work that Americans don't want to do. He's not complaining good people [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=542.08s)]
*  with bad people. You know, no, actually, he is being very clear that what Stephen Miller is [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=549.36s)]
*  executing, because Stephen Miller is the one who is in charge of this. Even the Miller's, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=556.16s)]
*  with the worst stuff to you. It was doing worse first than you were already mad. No, I wasn't. I [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=560.08s)]
*  was thrilled with worse first. Lock them all up. The point is 70% of the people who have been taken [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=565.6s)]
*  like Maryland are not convicted criminal. You're interrupting me because I want to roll it. I'm [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=570.4s)]
*  going to keep going. So Donald Trump's position on this, or at least the one that he said publicly [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=574.48s)]
*  today, and who knows if they actually changed the policy is reflective of exactly what those [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=580.24s)]
*  blue state governors were saying. If you listen to the content of J.V. Pritzker, if you listen to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=584.24s)]
*  what Gavin Newsom has been saying, criminals out and protesters, by the way, who have been violent, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  put them in jail as well. You don't have a process for that. That's why they've been arrested. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=592.88s)]
*  Gavin Newsom. Why is Trump doing this? Because you guys neglected this. That's why this is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=598.8s)]
*  happening. We did not neglect people who showed up at Home Depot to go to the judge. No, I'm not. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=604.4s)]
*  I am not upset about the process of getting people who are convicted of a crime out of this country. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=609.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm upset about the process of showing up at immigration court, at a Home Depot stop, at a nail [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=613.68s)]
*  salon. You're very upset about the Maryland dad. I don't want to talk about your cuticles again. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=619.04s)]
*  First of all, I don't call him a Maryland dad. Where is he? What? Where is the Maryland dad? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=621.68s)]
*  He's with huddling up with his lawyers. They've sued the Trump administration for contempt and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=625.6s)]
*  he'll get his day in court, which is what everybody wants. The majority of Americans just wants you to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=629.52s)]
*  be able to see an immigration judge and then send him back to El Salvador, but not to Seacot. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=633.76s)]
*  I kind of want him duck walking in the Seacot in his white underwear. Why? Until what's in the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=638.32s)]
*  environment is perfect. I can tell you why if you'll let me talk. I didn't interrupt you. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=644.24s)]
*  Say it to Greg. Because Greg interrupted me. Let me explain why. Because people like you think [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=648.48s)]
*  that immigration is a victimless crime. You truly believe that. Or you think it's a net positive, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=653.04s)]
*  illegal immigration. I come from a border city that is full of illegal immigrants. So much so [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=658.16s)]
*  that our Mexican restaurants have been closed down for a week and a half because ICE is there, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  invited. Come on in, help us out a little bit. We have problems. But this idea that illegal [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=668.16s)]
*  immigration is somehow victimless, if it's a victimless crime, and I'm not saying that everyone [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=674.88s)]
*  committing the crime is a bad person. The empathy isn't not there. Don't mistake my kindness for [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=679.92s)]
*  weakness. If it's a victimless crime, then my nieces don't have to change schools because [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=686.56s)]
*  there aren't enough English speakers in their class to get through a lesson in Dalton, Georgia. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=691.04s)]
*  If it's a victimless crime, then you don't have a situation where you can't use the health department [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=695.5999999999999s)]
*  because it's overran with illegal immigrants. If it's a victimless crime, you don't have a situation [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=700.4s)]
*  where every major function in your municipality is overran by illegal immigrants who have been [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=704.96s)]
*  educated and understand what they can come here and get. Not what they can come here and do. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=711.12s)]
*  And this idea about cheap labor, let me tell you what cheap labor did. My dad used to lay brick at [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=714.64s)]
*  $600 a thousand with a four-man crew, get it done well, and once it was done, it was done perfectly. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=719.12s)]
*  Mexicans come across the border, they'll lay it for $300 a thousand. 20 people show up, they do it [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=724.0s)]
*  quick, fast, in a hurry, and then it falls over at the end of winter because they didn't do it right. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=728.32s)]
*  Because not because they're bad, people because they learned to do it with the materials they had. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=732.72s)]
*  That's the victims of cheap labor, of illegal immigration, of doing things the wrong way. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=736.72s)]
*  The administration says self-deport will put you first in line to get back here. Democrats say, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  well there isn't a line to get back here. Well why the hell isn't there a line to get back here? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=747.12s)]
*  Maybe because when Trump handed Nancy Pelosi DACA and visa reform and other things in exchange for [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  the wall, she couldn't let him have that policy win in his first term. That's the problem. The [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  partisan politics is the problem. That senator from California, who the real insult is, nobody [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=761.2s)]
*  knows who the hell he is, he's showing up like that today. That is the problem. That gets nothing [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=765.9200000000001s)]
*  done. I'm a big fan of normalizing treating elected officials in power like regular people, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=770.24s)]
*  and that's exactly what they would have done to someone else. All right guys, up next, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=775.76s)]
*  Joe Biden's media cheap fakers are at it again. That was a delightful. Click here to subscribe [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5I0WsSvXEc&t=781.5200000000001s)]
