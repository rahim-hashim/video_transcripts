# Gutfeld: Accountability rains down hard on sanctuary city leaders
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E)
*  Accountability was raining down hard on America's sanctuary cities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=0.0s)]
*  The Democrat mayors from Boston, Chicago, Denver, and NYC [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=4.34s)]
*  in the hot seat on Capitol Hill and getting grilled by Republicans [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=8.84s)]
*  on why they're letting migrant criminals run wild. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=12.14s)]
*  Mayor Johnson, is Denver a sanctuary city? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=15.74s)]
*  Folks use that term differently. I can tell you what Denver does. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=18.34s)]
*  We do not... [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=20.34s)]
*  Okay, I take that as a yes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=20.84s)]
*  Is Chicago a sanctuary city? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=22.14s)]
*  A 40-year policy of being a welcoming city. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=24.14s)]
*  Let's talk about Tom Homan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=27.3s)]
*  Shame on him. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=29.58s)]
*  Others may want to bring hell. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=30.48s)]
*  We are here to bring peace to cities everywhere. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=31.98s)]
*  In the city of Boston, how much did you spend? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  We don't ask about immigration status and delivering city services. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=37.28s)]
*  You don't ask about how much money the city of Boston has spent on illegal immigration? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=39.58s)]
*  Are you out of your mind? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=43.94s)]
*  We don't distinguish between immigration status as part of our city policies. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=45.14s)]
*  Do you manage your budget or not, Mayor Wu? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=46.54s)]
*  That is how we keep our city safe. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  But of course, the Dems were losing their marbles over the hearing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  It's total bulls**t. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=55.419999999999995s)]
*  Absolute bulls**t. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=57.419999999999995s)]
*  They are not making America safer again. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=60.419999999999995s)]
*  And what they are doing is terrorizing immigrant families. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=63.419999999999995s)]
*  U.S.-born Americans... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=66.42s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=68.42s)]
*  ...commit more rape and murder than immigrants. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=68.92s)]
*  Listen, this trend of you all trying to get thrown out of committees so you can get on MSNBC... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=71.42s)]
*  ...is going to end. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=75.42s)]
*  We're not going to put up with it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=76.42s)]
*  Dana, this feels like it's so 2020. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=80.42s)]
*  I'm looking at this and maybe it's because we had the speech last night. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=84.36s)]
*  So maybe we're not as engaged in this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=88.36s)]
*  But you're watching. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=92.36s)]
*  You go, did anything come out of this? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=93.36s)]
*  I can't say. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=94.36s)]
*  I didn't watch a lick of it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=95.36s)]
*  Okay, so I think a couple things did. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=96.36s)]
*  First of all, Brandon Johnson has an approval rating that is like buponic plague level at 6.6%. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=98.36s)]
*  He went out of his way basically to tell Chicago, I don't care what you think. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=105.36s)]
*  I know you're saying that you want me to fix the neighborhoods. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=109.36s)]
*  I'm sticking to my guns here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=111.36s)]
*  The Boston mayor spent $650,000 to prep for this hearing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=113.3s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=117.3s)]
*  And that's like, remember the Ivy League presidents that gave the anti-Semitism hearings... [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=118.3s)]
*  ...and then they all lost their jobs? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=124.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, the citizens of Boston can't fire her until there's a next election... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=126.3s)]
*  ...because what a waste of money. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=131.3s)]
*  Plus, just last week she went on TV and she expressed condolences for a guy who tried to go on a killing spree with a knife... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=132.3s)]
*  ...because he got shot in the process. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=138.3s)]
*  And she was sorry for him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=140.3s)]
*  Well, because he used a knife and not a gun. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=142.24s)]
*  That's true. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=144.24s)]
*  It's true. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=145.24s)]
*  90% of Americans agree with this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=146.24s)]
*  We should remove murderers and rapists, illegal immigrants. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=149.24s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen 90% support for anything, except for maybe like right after 9-11. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=152.24s)]
*  Those were that kind of levels. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=156.24s)]
*  And to think of all of this, yesterday, in the month of January, or February, there were 8,900 crossings across the entire border... [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=158.24s)]
*  ...across the entire month. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=168.24s)]
*  A year before that, it was 189,000. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=171.18s)]
*  And the Biden-Harris administration, Corinne Jean-Pierre, all of them said, there's nothing we can do... [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=174.18s)]
*  ...because Donald Trump told Congress not to pass the legislation. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=179.18s)]
*  And that is the BS word. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=183.18s)]
*  Which I also want to go on the record, I don't understand all the Democrats cursing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=185.18s)]
*  I find it very unpersuasive and undignified. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=189.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EriocVOCk6E&t=200.24s)]
