# ‘The Five’ torches Kamala Harris’ comeback speech: ‘ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM’
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro along with Jessica Tarloff, Jesse Waters, Kaylee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=0.0s)]
*  McEnany and Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=10.0s)]
*  It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=12.56s)]
*  We are so excited the Democrats' favorite loser is back. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=21.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris is emerging from political hibernation to give a speech that's already getting mocked [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=25.44s)]
*  to high heaven. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  So look, some people are describing what's been happening in recent months as absolute [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=32.52s)]
*  chaos. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=39.84s)]
*  And of course I understand why. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=40.84s)]
*  And it's certainly true of those tariffs. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=44.88s)]
*  Tariffs that, as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=48.84s)]
*  And folks, what we are experiencing right now is exactly what they envision for America. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=53.88s)]
*  Right now we are living in their vision for America. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=64.68s)]
*  But this is not a vision that Americans want. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=73.72s)]
*  But let's get to the elephant in the room. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=78.0s)]
*  Harris digressed in her speech to babble about the giant creatures. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=80.6s)]
*  Who saw that video from a couple of weeks ago? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=86.24s)]
*  The one of the elephants at the San Diego Zoo during the earthquake? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  As soon as they felt the earth shaking beneath their feet, they got in a circle and stood [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=93.88s)]
*  next to each other to protect the most vulnerable. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=101.96s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=109.12s)]
*  What a powerful metaphor. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=110.72s)]
*  And this will certainly sting her ego. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=114.08s)]
*  President Trump is still beating Kamala. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=117.56s)]
*  Who would be doing a better job as president? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  Guess who comes out on top? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  Within the margin of error, but comes on top. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  This is not like the election result, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=126.48s)]
*  Trump 45 percent, two points ahead of Harris at 43 percent, 12 percent say they'd be doing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=128.72s)]
*  about the same. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=133.4s)]
*  But this is the key nugget here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=134.56s)]
*  It's not just about regretting that vote. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=136.16s)]
*  It's literally saying who would be doing the better job right now? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=137.78s)]
*  And Trump continues to score a higher percentage of the vote than Kamala Harris. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=141.74s)]
*  This looks a heck of a lot like the election result. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=147.14s)]
*  You know, Jessica, the Dems continue to put Kamala out there and we are glad to see her [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=151.9s)]
*  back. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=156.66s)]
*  But they say that they're clamoring for her voice now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=157.82s)]
*  Are you clamoring for Kamala's voice? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=161.0s)]
*  I am not, but I also have a particular employment situation where the way that I see Kamala [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=164.22s)]
*  is different than the way other Democrats see her. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=170.38s)]
*  She hasn't really been out there that much. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=173.5s)]
*  This was her comeback event and it's been a few months, obviously, since the election. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=176.06s)]
*  And yes, the elephant story didn't necessarily land. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=182.58s)]
*  But she was talking about some important themes that are resonant with Democrats right now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=186.52s)]
*  She had this line about Trump being a vessel for an agenda that has been decades in the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=191.24s)]
*  making about slashing public education, privatizing the government, shrinking it, all the while [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  giving people who are wealthy tax breaks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  And that will be the message that Democrats are moving with. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=205.36s)]
*  Kamala will not be our nominee in 2028. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=207.88s)]
*  Maybe she runs for governor. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  I am not sure about that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  But unsurprisingly, it was not nearly as bad as you are making it out to be. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  Who? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=218.4s)]
*  Me? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=219.4s)]
*  Well, the amazing part of it is that with 92 percent of the bad press Trump is getting, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=220.56s)]
*  he still beats her. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=226.44s)]
*  Okay, Jessie, you know, she's talking about the fact that the president is abandoning [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=227.68s)]
*  American ideals. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=232.44s)]
*  I guess kind of like what happened when Biden abandoned everybody in Kabul and when the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=234.36s)]
*  president decided to let the hostages stay there for 470 days and when he allowed 12 [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=239.88s)]
*  million illegals in. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=245.96s)]
*  I mean, does she have her, you know, her ideas straight? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=247.36s)]
*  No, everyone's just talking about elephants. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=250.56s)]
*  She gives this big speech, elephants, that's the only thing that came out of this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=253.4s)]
*  Jessica, she just said Kamala is not going to be the nominee. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=258.68s)]
*  Well, with Jessica's track record, she is. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=262.08s)]
*  What is wrong with you? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=265.6s)]
*  And I wasn't wrong about the election. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=266.6s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=267.6s)]
*  I couldn't help myself. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=268.6s)]
*  You're not sorry. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=269.6s)]
*  You actually are never sorry. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=270.6s)]
*  So please stop taking it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=272.24s)]
*  Did you know that elephants are actually protecting the vulnerable and elephants are actually [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=273.6s)]
*  the Republican symbol? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=278.72s)]
*  I don't even know if she realized that, but the analogy she was making was this, is that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  the Democrats need to just stop investigating the election, looking for new leadership, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=288.0s)]
*  coming up with new ideas, and they just need to blindly come together and form a mob of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  flesh for protection and survival. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=299.44s)]
*  That's really not the time to do that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=304.0s)]
*  And that's not what the Democratic Party needs right now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=306.76s)]
*  They don't need to just go back to that mob mentality and become an unthinking, unfeeling [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=309.32s)]
*  machine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=314.48s)]
*  And her advice is dumb. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=315.9s)]
*  When she's talking about chaos, she paid a consultant to tell her to say that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=318.48s)]
*  And that's not what the country's experiencing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=323.28s)]
*  There are doers and there are talkers. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=326.6s)]
*  And there's an old saying, Jessica, that talkers should do more and doers should talk more. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=329.56s)]
*  And she's a talker. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=335.0s)]
*  And Trump's a doer. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=336.6s)]
*  And he's taking a lot of action. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=337.92s)]
*  He talks constantly. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  Also. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  And he's taking a lot of risk. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  And Greg talks about risk a lot. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=343.6s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=345.16s)]
*  Risk takers are what makes this country great. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=346.16s)]
*  It's what makes great leadership. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  And what he's doing is he's taking on things that have other politicians have languished, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  trade, crime, border, culture. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=355.76s)]
*  And he's taking on these things at great risk to himself politically. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=358.56s)]
*  And this is like a guy that takes the last second shot in a basketball game or a general [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=362.5s)]
*  that invades a country when no one else thinks he has a shot. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=366.86s)]
*  These are the types of things that make a difference in history. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=371.48s)]
*  And he's the one doing it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=374.6s)]
*  And all she's doing is blah, blah, blah about elephants. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=376.54s)]
*  Well, you know, elephants are important. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=379.72s)]
*  And I think for you, Greg, as a new father, you know, her love for yellow buses and seeing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=382.5s)]
*  that what it was at the moon with your own eyes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=388.38s)]
*  And now is the elephants. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=391.3s)]
*  I mean, she is a leader in her own way. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=392.3s)]
*  She's a great babysitter. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=394.7s)]
*  You know, Jess, you got a good point. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=395.7s)]
*  The elephants are Republicans. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=398.38s)]
*  What did they do when they sensed fear? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=399.98s)]
*  They built a wall. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=401.74s)]
*  They did. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=402.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=403.74s)]
*  Elephants never forget. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=404.74s)]
*  But Kamala is too drunk to remember. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=405.74s)]
*  It is such a healthy contrast. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=407.62s)]
*  It's good to compare where you are with what you could have been and where or where you [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=410.02s)]
*  were in the past. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=414.34s)]
*  As long as she keeps talking, we will always be reminded. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=415.7s)]
*  Thank God we didn't get that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=419.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, every time I get furious with Jessica, and it's not often, but it happens, I remember [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  what was there before. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=428.58s)]
*  And I suddenly become very grateful. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=430.7s)]
*  When you're a DEI choice, like Kamala, you're like the jock in high school. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=434.46000000000004s)]
*  The teachers know not to grade you the way they grade other people. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=440.14000000000004s)]
*  People make excuses for your tardiness, your obliviousness, your entitlement, because your [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=443.3s)]
*  presence is enough. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=447.54s)]
*  The way a jock fulfills the goal as the sports reputation, Kamala was that for diversity, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=449.86s)]
*  for equity, equality. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=458.02000000000004s)]
*  But she didn't have to do anything else. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=462.06s)]
*  The lesson here is identity is not enough. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=464.22s)]
*  You put all your eggs in the woke box, you never get a leader, you only get the box the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=466.54s)]
*  leader comes in. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=470.58s)]
*  But I do have an idea. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=472.02s)]
*  And I think Kamala should do this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=474.02s)]
*  Netflix should create an alternative history series, you know, like Man in the High Castle, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=477.1s)]
*  about Kamala winning and she plays herself. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=483.74s)]
*  They could recreate the White House. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=486.7s)]
*  She could be in it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=488.5s)]
*  This is a billion dollar idea. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=489.5s)]
*  I would write it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=490.5s)]
*  It could be a parallel universe where she shows up every day as though she's the president [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=491.66s)]
*  and we could do a real time comparison. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=496.7s)]
*  That's like what they did with Biden. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=499.06s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=500.7s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=501.7s)]
*  They already have that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=502.7s)]
*  This is real though. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=503.7s)]
*  The amazing part of Kamala is that she raised so much money, it was two billion dollars [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=505.9s)]
*  and went through it and she thinks she can continue to raise money to win an election. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=512.18s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=516.98s)]
*  She thinks she can. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=518.36s)]
*  Look, she's leading in every poll I've seen of the Democratic primary. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=519.36s)]
*  Now that could change. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=523.12s)]
*  She has huge name ID. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=524.12s)]
*  I get that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=525.12s)]
*  But currently you're looking at the de facto nominee, if you were to believe the polls, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=526.12s)]
*  her speech, her coming out speech was very on brand, especially the earthquake story [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=530.24s)]
*  about elephants and the San Diego Zoo. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=535.64s)]
*  Very on brand, very Kamala. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=538.16s)]
*  So she kept to tradition there. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=539.52s)]
*  I think though, if you look at this, she lost big. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  There's no denying that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=545.04s)]
*  Donald Trump was the first Republican president to win the popular vote in 20 years. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=546.36s)]
*  He had the highest raw vote total of any Republican president ever in history. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=551.16s)]
*  He increased his Latino support by 13, Black support by 15, young support by 19 and every [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=556.9s)]
*  state jurisdiction with very few exceptions moved right. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=562.28s)]
*  So this person delivered one of the biggest losses for the Democrats. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=565.72s)]
*  She will deliver a massive loss for Democrats. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=569.4s)]
*  Again, you saw CNN, they couldn't even believe their own polling. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=571.44s)]
*  People think Trump would do a better job. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=574.08s)]
*  There's an Emerson poll that reflects that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=575.64s)]
*  She lost once, she will lose again. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=578.76s)]
*  And if Democrats want to engage in the art of kamikaze politics by all means, because [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=581.48s)]
*  it's going to go zoom and that will be the end. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g36wbb5Voo&t=585.68s)]
