# ‘The Five’: Trump bashes Musk’s idea of a new political party
**Fox News - The Five:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk)
*  Big beautiful beef is back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk wants to launch a third party called the America Party. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=2.48s)]
*  President Trump says he's saddened to watch his former first buddy go completely off the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=7.78s)]
*  rails and essentially becoming a train wreck. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous to start a third party. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=14.8s)]
*  We have a tremendous success with the Republican Party. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=17.84s)]
*  The Democrats have lost their way, but it's always been a two-party system. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=22.8s)]
*  And I think starting a third party just adds to confusion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=27.24s)]
*  It really seems to have been developed for two parties. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=30.68s)]
*  Third parties have never worked. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=33.12s)]
*  So he can have fun with it, but I think it's ridiculous. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=35.12s)]
*  Kellyanne, is Elon Musk serious about the third party? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=39.4s)]
*  I hope these two reconcile at some point, but these third parties don't do well in this [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=46.76s)]
*  In fact, Trump himself has transformed the Republican Party into the party, the worker. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=47.76s)]
*  He's diversified his coalition. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=51.4s)]
*  I think his campaign promises have been a blueprint for governing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=53.88s)]
*  He's on a hot two-week streak in counting. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=57.68s)]
*  But Musk has to realize that you need a lot more than money to start and be successful [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=60.16s)]
*  the third party. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=64.48s)]
*  You end up being a spoiler, by the way, because you're against something. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=66.08s)]
*  And we've had, I think it forced Herschel Walker into a runoff in Georgia. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=69.48s)]
*  He eventually lost. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=72.92s)]
*  That woman Marcy Kaepter in Ohio barely won her congressional seat because there was a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=74.48s)]
*  third party libertarian in there that helped her. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=78.52s)]
*  And he has to realize 50 different rules, 50 different thresholds to get on the ballot [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=81.28s)]
*  in 50 states, 15 percent to qualify you to be on the debate stage in president. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=86.0s)]
*  So it sounds all fun and games. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=91.28s)]
*  But I actually think, by the way, which consultants are going to go work for Elon Musk? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=94.28s)]
*  Lot of money, but against President Trump as he really transformed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=99.64s)]
*  Do they want to Ross Perot, the Republican Party? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=102.84s)]
*  Well, I have two things on that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=105.28s)]
*  One is I think that whoever is telling Elon Musk that this is a good idea is probably [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=106.96s)]
*  the consultant that wants to make a lot of money and it won't be successful. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=110.04s)]
*  This other thing I would say is that you could try to Ross Perot, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=113.72000000000001s)]
*  But what ends up happening, I'm hoping someone will convey to him that the people who would [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=116.72s)]
*  benefit most from this are the ones who want to investigate him and jail him and fire bomb [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=120.64s)]
*  the Teslas and harass people who bought some of his products, because that's what would [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=125.72s)]
*  benefit in the long run. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=129.72s)]
*  How are you trying to have these two men make up, Greg? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=131.68s)]
*  Well, it's very interesting. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  You put it that way. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=136.28s)]
*  This is a passionate couple. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=136.96s)]
*  You know them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  Everybody knows this passionate couple. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  They love each other, but they quarrel publicly. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=142.0s)]
*  And we can always predict the outcomes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=145.4s)]
*  They'll be yelling and screaming at the restaurant table, and there's going to be, 20 minutes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=146.88s)]
*  later there's awkwardness as they just kiss and make up, and it's usually in the bathroom [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=152.4s)]
*  where everybody can hear it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=157.0s)]
*  This is what it is. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=159.68s)]
*  I like the way Trump deals with Musk. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=161.8s)]
*  He knows he's a prickly genius, but it's almost a fatherly kind of thing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=164.8s)]
*  You don't see that very often from Trump. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=169.24s)]
*  Also, I think a lot of people, I don't know anything about this, but I'm going to say [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=171.36s)]
*  it anyway, I think people are misreading this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think this is a third party, as in the Libertarian Party or the Reform Party [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=177.72s)]
*  or the Bull Moose Party, if you will. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=182.36s)]
*  I think it's more like a tea party thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=185.56s)]
*  A group created to apply pressure in certain places, maybe to get rid of some people you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  don't like, but bring in somebody who is singularly about the debt. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=192.8s)]
*  So it's not about running a presidential candidate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=196.36s)]
*  If it exists, it will always throw behind somebody like Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  It's more about applying pressure. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=202.82s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=206.0s)]
*  I say we kind of treat you the way Trump treats Musk, like a prickly genius. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=207.0s)]
*  Well, you're good on the first syllable. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=211.8s)]
*  Jessica? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=216.0s)]
*  Obviously it doesn't work with our system, like Kellyanne was saying. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=219.24s)]
*  I think it would be great if we had proportional representation. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=222.52s)]
*  There are a lot of people who don't feel represented by the two major parties and are looking for [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  something that's closer to the way that they see the world or to have representatives that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=231.4s)]
*  they feel are more responsive to the things that actually matter to them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  But it's not going to happen. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=239.28s)]
*  It's winner take all, and he'll just be a little bit of a prickly menace. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=240.88s)]
*  Pop quiz. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=245.36s)]
*  What was the Bull Moose Party platform? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=246.36s)]
*  Click 543. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=248.48s)]
*  I don't know either. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=251.16s)]
*  Up next, he fights for truth, justice, and your preferred pronouns. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=252.16s)]
*  The new Superman is going woke. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46aYYHmyMk&t=257.52s)]
