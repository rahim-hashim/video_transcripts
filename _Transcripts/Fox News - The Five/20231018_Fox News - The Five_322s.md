# Jesse Watters: Biden just handed Hamas a check for $100 MILLION
**Fox News - The Five:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI)
*  United States is the biggest devil behind all of this. They're just evil. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, a day of rage in the Middle East. In other words, it was Wednesday. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=25.48s)]
*  Embassies under assault. It was the perfect day for a trip to Israel. The [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=30.76s)]
*  president landed, hugged Netanyahu and then almost fell asleep. I asked the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=36.24s)]
*  Secretary of State when he and I were working as Senate to write something [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=41.72s)]
*  for him and he said, he wrote a line that I think is appropriate. He said it's not [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=44.64s)]
*  we need. Not just, uh, well, I won't go into it. I'll wait a letter. Taking too [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=52.88s)]
*  much time. Biden only met with Netanyahu today. The rest of the Arab leaders [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=59.44s)]
*  snubbed them. We give these people billions and they snub us. No respect. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=63.6s)]
*  But after a double espresso, Biden took the podium and in fairness, delivered [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  touching remarks about what it means to lose a loved one. He said he stands with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=72.72s)]
*  now and forever. But then he handed the Palestinians a check for $100 million. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=78.16s)]
*  Today, I'm also announcing $100 million in new U.S. funding for humanitarian [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  assistance in both Gaza and the West Bank. This money will support more than [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  one million displaced and conflict affected Palestinians, including [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=94.32s)]
*  emergency needs in Gaza. If Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=98.32s)]
*  demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=104.32s)]
*  Palestinian people and it will end. If Hamas steals the money, come on, man. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  Biden just bought terrorists a fresh arsenal. We're a bunch of suckers. What [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=114.96s)]
*  are the Arabs giving him? Nothing. The most any Arab nation is giving the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians $4 million. We give him 100 million. We're funding both sides of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  the war. We give Israel money. We give Iran money. We give the Palestinians money. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=130.72s)]
*  Hunter's got to be getting a cut. So Biden hugs Bibi, falls asleep, writes a check to Hamas, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=135.44s)]
*  and then tells Israel, don't turn Gaza into a quagmire like Bush did in Iraq. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  After 9-11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=146.55999999999997s)]
*  justice, we also made mistakes. I know the choices are never clear or easy for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  leadership. There's always cost, but it requires being deliberate and an honest [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=157.04s)]
*  assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=168.32s)]
*  Palestinian people. Biden voted for the Iraq war and now he's telling Israel, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=174.64s)]
*  don't be stupid like I was and do your best to kill terrorists, not civilians. Thank you, Joe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=179.68s)]
*  Great advice. He should have told them, don't leave the weapons behind so terrorists can't [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=185.36s)]
*  have them like I did in Afghanistan. The president then said our defense department [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=190.08s)]
*  confirmed that Hamas's rocket hit the hospital, not Israel's. Yet the president never mentioned [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=194.88s)]
*  radical Islam. He never uttered a single word about fanatical Muslims held bent on ethnic [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=201.36s)]
*  cleansing, never touched it, skipped right over the root causes. Also never mentioned Iran. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=208.24s)]
*  Biden is trying to soft pedal Iranian involvement because his administration has been letting Iran [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=214.96s)]
*  get away with murder for years. To his credit, president Trump had demolished ISIS, assassinated [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=220.4s)]
*  Soleimani and pulled out of the nuke deal and slapped crippling sanctions on that country's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=227.28s)]
*  energy sector. He had great relationships with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=232.8s)]
*  all the major Arab players. And Israel was cutting deals with these Arabs and now the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=239.68s)]
*  deals are on hold because of Iranian mischief. And Biden isn't going to be able to put this [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=245.36s)]
*  back together. He's just not. Biden was so angry after getting snubbed by the Arabs and being [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=250.8s)]
*  greeted with rockets and riots and hospital hoaxes that he snapped at binder on the plane ride home. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=257.36s)]
*  Watch. He said he was very blunt with the Israelis on the need to get humanitarian aid to Gaza or [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=263.12s)]
*  what exactly on everything. No, I was very blunt about the need to support getting humanitarian aid [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=269.04s)]
*  to Gaza, get it to Gaza and do it quickly. All right. Anymore to the hospital? Don't. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=280.48s)]
*  So prime time isn't really sure what the trip accomplished. Symbolically, it was a victory for [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel. Financially, it was a victory for Hamas. And this obviously delayed Israel's ground campaign [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=296.24s)]
*  into Gaza. The Mideast looks even more chaotic than it did before Biden-Iraq, which is quite [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=302.64s)]
*  the accomplishment. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8ue_d9fEI&t=308.88s)]
