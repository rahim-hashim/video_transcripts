# Gutfeld on the Iranian threat and the media
**Fox News - The Five:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU)
*  So Trump's no longer just a racist, sexist, or botanist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=0.0s)]
*  He's an assassinist. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=4.84s)]
*  And here we are in the assassination business again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=6.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, this is a top general. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=9.6s)]
*  We didn't need to dock them off. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=11.48s)]
*  He wasn't operational. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=12.48s)]
*  He was a leader. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=13.48s)]
*  We killed this guy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=14.58s)]
*  The president of the United States, they used to hide from assassination responsibility. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=15.58s)]
*  This president is bragging about his assassi- and I don't think you're an assassin. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=20.36s)]
*  Anyway, thank you so much. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=24.16s)]
*  This president is. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=25.5s)]
*  Ooh, I guess that's a step up from calling him a Republican. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=26.5s)]
*  And after the left criticized Liz Warren for calling Soleimani a murderer, obviously hurting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=30.06s)]
*  the feelings of Planned Parenthood, she fell in line quickly, also calling Trump an assassin. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=34.34s)]
*  Then came Bernie. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=39.86s)]
*  But this guy was as bad as he was an official of the Iranian government. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=41.74s)]
*  And you unleash. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=47.28s)]
*  Then if China does that, if Russia does that, Russia has been implicated under Putin with [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=48.28s)]
*  assassinating dissidents. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=54.660000000000004s)]
*  So once you're in the business of assassination, you unleash some very, very terrible forces. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=56.82s)]
*  And what I am seeing now in this world as a result of Trump's actions, more and more [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=62.72s)]
*  chaos, more and more instability. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=69.42s)]
*  You gotta give them credit. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=72.52s)]
*  They get on the same page faster than a horny congressman. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=73.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=77.58s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=78.58s)]
*  Accurate. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=79.58s)]
*  That was a mercy laugh. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=80.58s)]
*  But if Trump's an assassin, what's that make Obama or any president who takes out a threat? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=81.8s)]
*  Basically, it's just something new to call Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=87.22s)]
*  Fact is, we kill bad guys all the time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=90.3s)]
*  Problem is, they just make more and that sucks. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=93.16s)]
*  But you can't blame Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=95.94s)]
*  He didn't put us there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=96.94s)]
*  And don't blame him for killing scum who like killing us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=98.62s)]
*  It's not a good look. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=101.12s)]
*  Taking the side of the thugs with American blood on their hands, leave that to Colin [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=102.72s)]
*  Kaepernick. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=106.62s)]
*  He needs the work. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=107.62s)]
*  Now the media's new take is, what's gonna happen next? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=108.94s)]
*  They're predicting bad things, which oddly have actually already happened. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=112.14s)]
*  Dead contractors, cyber attacks, attacks on ships and embassies, and soldiers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=116.62s)]
*  If killing Soleimani makes the world worse than that, I'd like to know how letting him [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  live would have made it better. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  Anyone? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=128.62s)]
*  But I get it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=129.66s)]
*  Because taking out dirtbags who kill our troops is a good thing, the media must again focus [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=130.66s)]
*  on imagined bad things to come. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  But what if what you imagine has happened every day since Mannix was in prime time? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=137.26s)]
*  Predicting that Iran is planning bad things is like predicting Michael Moore will eat [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=143.62s)]
*  a pie. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=147.34s)]
*  No bookie is gonna take your bet. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=148.34s)]
*  And really, those who keep predicting the end have never been right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=150.56s)]
*  But that doesn't stop them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=153.17999999999998s)]
*  They want the apocalypse. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  Just to say, I told you so. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, check out these butts. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=158.38s)]
*  He has perpetrated great suffering and misery in places like Lebanon and Yemen as well. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=160.9s)]
*  But the issue is, was this a wise move? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=167.5s)]
*  Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=169.9s)]
*  members. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=174.74s)]
*  But even many of Soleimani's enemies admitted he was a military genius. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=175.74s)]
*  No one should be shedding any tears for Qasem Soleimani. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  But at the same time, I think the fact, as Ambassador Sherman said, that the consequences [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=182.6s)]
*  of this could be unbelievable. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=189.38s)]
*  We're better off without him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=191.38s)]
*  But that had to be evaluated in the context of all the risks that come along with it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=193.18s)]
*  But, but, but, that's more butts than that Tommy John underwear commercial we keep playing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=197.7s)]
*  every day. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=202.86s)]
*  They are snug, though. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=204.54s)]
*  But hey, when the media keeps saying butt, it's because they're talking out of their [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=205.54s)]
*  asses, which is why everything they say stinks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=209.1s)]
*  That's an analogy I probably should have let die, Sandra. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=212.06s)]
*  I apologize for that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=216.86s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with the butts. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=217.9s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=219.5s)]
*  Those butts are not bad. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=220.5s)]
*  Those are questions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=222.74s)]
*  And it's reasonable to ask questions in the wake of this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=223.74s)]
*  Even Joe Lieberman, we were talking about him on this program yesterday in the Wall [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=226.10000000000002s)]
*  Street Journal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=228.86s)]
*  Great butt. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=229.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=230.86s)]
*  Why can't Democrats admit that Soleimani's death makes us safer? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=231.86s)]
*  He said that is a question that we should all be asking. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=234.74s)]
*  And he was asking of his fellow Democrats. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=238.86s)]
*  The butts are bad, Greg. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  As Americans, we should all have questions. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=243.02s)]
*  That's why Congress is being addressed right now and tomorrow so that they can let them [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=245.54s)]
*  know what the intelligence was and what ultimately led to this decision. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=250.66s)]
*  Going back to Elizabeth Warren, though, she was following Bernie Sanders. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=255.02s)]
*  I think he was the first on the campaign trail to use the assassin verbiage, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=257.66s)]
*  Liz Warren then followed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=263.34s)]
*  First she called him a murderer. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=264.74s)]
*  Then she said this is the assassination of a senior foreign military official. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=265.98s)]
*  She was then asked by Meghan McCain on The View three times. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=270.7s)]
*  Ooh, I have that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=273.14s)]
*  Whether or not, would you like to play? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=274.34s)]
*  I would love to play it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=276.53999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=277.53999999999996s)]
*  Let's do that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=278.53999999999996s)]
*  Sandra? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=279.53999999999996s)]
*  A terrorist? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  You issued a statement calling Soleimani a murderer. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=281.53999999999996s)]
*  Later you issued a second statement saying that he was, quote, an assassination of a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=283.58s)]
*  senior foreign military official. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=287.7s)]
*  I don't understand the flip flop. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=289.62s)]
*  This isn't a change. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=291.5s)]
*  They're true. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=293.17999999999995s)]
*  The question is, what is the response that the President of the United States should [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=294.17999999999995s)]
*  make to add in a pro for you? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=300.82s)]
*  He's part of a group that has been designated. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=303.98s)]
*  But is he a terrorist? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  He's part of a group that's been designated. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  So he's not a terrorist. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=307.70000000000005s)]
*  Of course he is. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  Excellent timing on that, Greg. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=310.70000000000005s)]
*  But I'll tie it all together then. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=312.3s)]
*  Joe Lieberman then to what you just saw from Elizabeth Warren there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=314.62s)]
*  At the end of his piece in The Wall Street Journal, he asks, don't Democrats risk looking [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  weak in the face of evil like this and not being able to make an admission like that? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=322.82s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me just say I am not going to fall for your flattery, Sandra. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=328.26s)]
*  My butt is my business. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=333.66s)]
*  But I don't have a real butt here because I think Soleimani was a bad guy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=335.66s)]
*  Nonetheless, I didn't say I butt because I don't have a butt. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=339.26s)]
*  But I do think that it's rational, as you were saying, to ask about ramifications, consequences [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=344.46s)]
*  and the like. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=350.06s)]
*  Are we safer as a nation? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=351.06s)]
*  But they're not doing that drawing conclusions about it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=352.62s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=355.1s)]
*  Even you said just a moment ago that they're asking questions about what's to come. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=356.1s)]
*  Do you believe he was assassinated? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=360.1s)]
*  No, because that would be extra legal. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=361.66s)]
*  And I think that's what it's about, Lawrence. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=363.54s)]
*  If you use that term, then you're talking about taking an extra legal step. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=365.54s)]
*  My question about it is this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=370.14s)]
*  If you say, listen, he was a terrorist and he's an enemy of ours, an enemy of the American [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=372.06s)]
*  people, if we start killing all the bad guys, we got a lot of people to kill. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=376.7s)]
*  You're going to go after Vladimir Putin? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=381.22s)]
*  You want to go after some of these folks in Latin America? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=382.94s)]
*  I think the president said it best today. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=385.54s)]
*  They kill our people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=388.02s)]
*  And then we have to be sensitive to them and their culture. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=389.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what he said. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=392.38s)]
*  I have that tape too. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=393.38s)]
*  My goodness, you people are on top of things. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=394.38s)]
*  Do we have that tape? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=396.7s)]
*  Or did I dream that? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=397.7s)]
*  His past was horrible. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=399.46s)]
*  He was a terrorist. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=400.58s)]
*  He was a monster. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=401.58s)]
*  And he's no longer a monster. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=403.41999999999996s)]
*  He's dead. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=404.85999999999996s)]
*  And that's a good thing for a lot of countries. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=406.34s)]
*  I don't think anybody can complain about it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=408.14s)]
*  I don't hear too many people, other than politicians, who are trying to win the presidency. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=409.9s)]
*  Those are the ones that are complaining. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=415.82s)]
*  Then you got the AP that are, they play video on their Twitter page of the Supreme Leader crying. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=418.02000000000004s)]
*  You have Michael Moore pinning an apology to the Supreme Leader. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  You have the New York Times writing their obituary. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=426.86s)]
*  It's like this guy wasn't a terrorist and killing over 600 of our troops. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=429.54s)]
*  No, no, wait a second. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=434.14000000000004s)]
*  Everything you just said is news. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=435.14000000000004s)]
*  Everything you just said is news. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=437.14000000000004s)]
*  When you have the Supreme Leader reacting in that way to the man's death, that's informing [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  us about the reaction on the ground. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=442.74s)]
*  The apology was too? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=445.62s)]
*  Should we be apologizing to him? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=447.58s)]
*  But here's my point. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=448.58s)]
*  Here's the point I was trying to make. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=449.58s)]
*  Is the U.S. safer? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  Is Israel safer without the Iran deal? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=452.3s)]
*  Are we safer? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=455.9s)]
*  Are we in a better position to fight ISIS? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=456.9s)]
*  If there was an immediate threat, we are safer. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=458.9s)]
*  We are not safer. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=460.66s)]
*  But Democrats don't need intelligence. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=461.66s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, wait a second then. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=462.66s)]
*  Tell me what the immediate threat was, because this guy has been going about plotting terrorist [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=463.66s)]
*  attacks for a long time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=468.22s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=469.66s)]
*  He has. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=470.66s)]
*  That means the immediate threat is proof in the past that they killed people. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=471.66s)]
*  What immediate threat? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=473.66s)]
*  They're like daily. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=474.70000000000005s)]
*  There's enough public information. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=475.70000000000005s)]
*  Reuters has an amazing piece out about how Soleimani was in Iraq in September and October [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=478.70000000000005s)]
*  sitting across from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and talking about the way that they were going [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=484.74s)]
*  to use new Iranian militias that had not yet been detected by the United States to go after [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=489.54s)]
*  American troops, both in Iraq and all over the region. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=494.18s)]
*  So there's plenty of public information on that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=497.74s)]
*  The problem is not asking questions about what might happen next. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=501.18s)]
*  The issue is that you're insinuating that the president and his entire administration [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=504.66s)]
*  isn't thinking about that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=508.18s)]
*  And they didn't think through that if we take this guy out. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=509.82s)]
*  And Mohandas, who was also in the car, who was another terrorist who was a really bad [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=512.86s)]
*  actor, smuggled in most of the IEDs from Iran to Iraq that blew up our troops. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=516.9s)]
*  He was in the car as well. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=521.4200000000001s)]
*  The intelligence on where they were at the right time was good. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=522.54s)]
*  So now we're questioning what's going to happen next. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=526.5s)]
*  But the idea that we don't know or have a plan leading up to this is ridiculous. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=529.22s)]
*  And also they keep saying, well, the president is incompetent. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=534.38s)]
*  He doesn't know what the Iranians are going to do, blah, blah, blah. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=538.86s)]
*  They've been on this guy and they understand that the Obama administration appeased the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=542.7800000000001s)]
*  regime over and over again. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=546.94s)]
*  Soleimani had sanctions taken off of him as a result of the Iran deal, as a result of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=548.46s)]
*  Barack Obama's negotiations on that deal. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=553.3000000000001s)]
*  And yet here we are today questioning whether President Trump is one who is appeasing the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=556.54s)]
*  Iranians. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=560.78s)]
*  Juan, you were one of the Democrats saying President Trump always questions our intelligence. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=561.78s)]
*  Now you trust them and now it's a problem. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=567.62s)]
*  He's trusting the intelligence agencies and saying, let's go take him out. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=568.62s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=573.8199999999999s)]
*  Stop the presses. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=574.8199999999999s)]
*  Stop everything. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=575.8199999999999s)]
*  Juan Williams is going to quote Tucker Carlson. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  Tucker Carlson said, oh, wait a minute. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=578.3s)]
*  It was people like Lawrence who were saying, oh, this is the deep state. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=581.0999999999999s)]
*  We can't trust the deep state. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=584.2199999999999s)]
*  They're terrible. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=585.3s)]
*  We love the deep state. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=587.06s)]
*  Tucker Carlson heads off. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=588.06s)]
*  It is. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=591.06s)]
*  But the thing is, I think that you can say both things. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=592.06s)]
*  You don't have to trust any intelligence. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=594.42s)]
*  You don't have to trust it, but you can still kill the guy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=596.66s)]
*  You can do both. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=599.18s)]
*  That's not what it is. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=600.18s)]
*  Your point was, oh, we don't trust the president because we think the president isn't thinking [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=601.18s)]
*  this through. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=606.14s)]
*  Have we de-esplained? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=607.14s)]
*  I know. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=608.14s)]
*  The president, this president put sanctions, economic sanctions on and had they had any [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=609.14s)]
*  effect, if so, why did he have to kill someone? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=613.18s)]
*  They have had an effect. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=615.18s)]
*  The idea that we need to go is right now. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=618.18s)]
*  I want to thank Juan for laughing at my joke about the page. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=622.98s)]
*  I want to thank Sandra for her compliment. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=625.98s)]
*  See, we're very civil here at the five. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkwYDT-BqU&t=627.98s)]
