# Keith Kellogg: We haven't really gone to the root cause - Iran
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I)
*  We're going to keep going with this, because we have retired Army Lieutenant General Keith [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=0.0s)]
*  Kellogg. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=3.48s)]
*  He's also a Fox News contributor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=4.48s)]
*  He can give us his thoughts and tell us where we are right or wrong. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=5.48s)]
*  But mostly I'm sure we're right, as you will say. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=8.96s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=12.72s)]
*  I'm not going to go where Greg was at, though. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=14.92s)]
*  Look, here's one of the things that—the reason why you want to get to a level of deterrence. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=16.84s)]
*  And deterrence is based on credibility of what you're doing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=21.68s)]
*  And I know it feels good to bomb 85 targets with thousands of pounds of munitions on it, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=24.68s)]
*  and you rip your shirt off and pound your chest. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=29.98s)]
*  But if you don't establish deterrence with credibility, it's just going to continue. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=32.54s)]
*  And my concern is that we haven't really gone to the root cause, and the root cause [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=36.34s)]
*  is Iran. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=40.5s)]
*  And that's where you have to go. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=41.5s)]
*  You have to go downtown to establish that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=42.5s)]
*  And why is that important? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=45.18s)]
*  Because when you look at the Middle East—I'm looking at the Middle East when people have [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=46.82s)]
*  talked, well, it's most dangerous it's been since 1973. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=50.22s)]
*  Now, I think the world's approaching the most dangerous state since 1938, when the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain went to Munich, and he came out of Munich [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  after talking to Hitler, and he said, oh, peace in our time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=62.62s)]
*  Then you started World War. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=64.78s)]
*  Wars generally start by big mistakes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=66.7s)]
*  And this is getting to be a big mistake area. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=68.86s)]
*  You're looking at Iran that is getting ready to go nuclear. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=71.22s)]
*  They're already enriching almost at 90 percent of uranium. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=74.22s)]
*  And when you get to 90 percent, you can create a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=78.1s)]
*  And if they get that, it totally destabilizes the Middle East. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=81.9s)]
*  You react differently to a nuclear power than to a non-nuclear power. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=86.94000000000001s)]
*  You see all the destabilization there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=90.94000000000001s)]
*  And we're not forcing ourselves and forcing the rest of the world to understand this has [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=92.78s)]
*  gone about as far as we want it to go, stabilize the region. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=97.42s)]
*  And we're not going there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  And so we're letting the Chinese get involved. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  Chinese make a deal, a peace deal, between Saudi Arabia and Iran. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=104.34s)]
*  That would have never happened previously. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=108.78s)]
*  And you look at what's happening in Ukraine, in Russia, in the Far East with China. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=110.94s)]
*  And this all impacts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  I think what we're doing right now is we're feeling good. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=116.78s)]
*  We're bombing a lot of sand and a lot of asphalt. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=119.02s)]
*  But we're not going after the root cause. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=121.5s)]
*  And I hate to say it, but we haven't gone into Iran. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=123.58s)]
*  And I know that if you do that, the risk goes up. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=126.34s)]
*  I've got that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  But you've got to get uncomfortable when you do something like that to make the other [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=130.29999999999998s)]
*  side uncomfortable. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=133.3s)]
*  Iran does not want to go to war with the United States of America. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=134.94s)]
*  They are afraid of the United States. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=138.18s)]
*  They know what we can do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=139.84s)]
*  And we should make them understand that we are going to take a step that is going to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=141.38s)]
*  prevent you from doing anything further. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  That means take out their economic facilities, like their oil fields. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=147.61999999999998s)]
*  That means taking out their leadership, either Ismail Ghani, the leader of the Quds Force. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=151.5s)]
*  You're talking about Khamenei, the supreme leader. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=156.45999999999998s)]
*  You're talking about taking out all their military facilities. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  You've got to be willing to go there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=163.82s)]
*  And when the other side realizes that you're willing to step up and go there, they're [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  going to back down. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  Right now, we have not sent that message at all. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=170.54s)]
*  And I don't think this campaign has a good end state to it right now. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=173.42s)]
*  Judge. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=176.94s)]
*  You know, there's no question, General, that we, I believe, have the military ability and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=177.94s)]
*  capacity to be able to have a war with Iran. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=184.22s)]
*  I'm not promoting it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=187.06s)]
*  I'm not interested in that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=188.18s)]
*  I'm not interested in World War III. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=189.5s)]
*  But to continue to say we don't want a conflict with Iran, if they don't want a conflict with [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=191.74s)]
*  us and if that is your opinion, why are we so afraid to at least threaten them, to at [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  least take out some infrastructure, to at least take out some of the oil fields? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=203.14s)]
*  Why are we so afraid? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=207.66s)]
*  Well, it's capacity. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=209.61999999999998s)]
*  We've got the capacity and capability. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=212.33999999999997s)]
*  That's without question. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  It all comes down to leadership. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=215.5s)]
*  And there's the commander in chief, Article II, Section 2. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=217.7s)]
*  There's the president. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  And it's his decision making, his advisors as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=221.77999999999997s)]
*  And I really think they're risk averse. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  You know, what your adversaries do, they read your leadership. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  They do that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=229.54s)]
*  We do that as well. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=230.54s)]
*  And they say, OK, we know this leader is probably going to react this way. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=231.94s)]
*  This leader is going to react that way. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=234.66s)]
*  And they look at somebody like a President Biden, who has traditionally been risk averse. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=236.22s)]
*  We all set patterns. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=240.14s)]
*  You set patterns. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=241.26s)]
*  I set patterns. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=242.26s)]
*  You go to the same service station. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=243.26s)]
*  You go to the same grocery store. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=244.42s)]
*  You set those patterns as leadership as well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  And they see a leader who's very risk averse and doesn't want to go there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=248.38s)]
*  So they're going to push the envelope. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=251.54s)]
*  You've got to break that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=253.14s)]
*  You've got to break away from that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=254.14s)]
*  That's the only way you reach a conclusion. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=255.45999999999998s)]
*  There's nothing to do with capacity. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=257.42s)]
*  We've got plenty of that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=259.34s)]
*  And I think the Iranians have said, I think we can push this guy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=260.74s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're doing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=264.02s)]
*  I understand that's a harsh assessment. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=265.02s)]
*  I know that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=267.26s)]
*  But I think it's true. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=268.26s)]
*  Well, if I heard you correctly, what I heard you describe is something akin to what Lindsey [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=269.26s)]
*  Graham might have tweeted the other day when he said bomb Tehran. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=272.82s)]
*  You might have not targeted Tehran, but you talked about oil fields. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  You talked about a direct hit on Iran. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=278.74s)]
*  And you suggested that any type of hit like that would back Iran down from this aggressive [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  stance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=285.58s)]
*  I'm just curious, what would be your historical precedent? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=286.58s)]
*  If you're selling that to the American people, that we are going to take an aggressive action [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=289.1s)]
*  against some nation state and they will back down. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=293.04s)]
*  And this will not antastasize into a greater war. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=295.74s)]
*  Can you give me that when that happened in American history that was a great success? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=302.74s)]
*  I give you a lot of them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=304.5s)]
*  I'll start with the Civil War, when Grant Martin sent Sherman down to the sea and they [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=305.62s)]
*  burned Atlanta. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=310.3s)]
*  You keep coming towards this way. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=311.3s)]
*  When the United States of America sent a clear message in World War II when we firebombed [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=314.5s)]
*  Dresden into the ground, when we bombed Nakazaki and Hiroshima with an atomic weapon instead [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=318.38s)]
*  of invading. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=323.86s)]
*  Those things happen all the time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=324.94s)]
*  But what I'm curious about, General, just I'm sorry to interrupt, but what I'm curious [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=325.94s)]
*  about the two examples you gave us of the Civil War and World War II were clearly wide, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=328.3s)]
*  worldwide metastasized actions that resulted in millions of deaths. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=333.82s)]
*  I thought you were describing an aggressive attack in Iran to avoid a greater war. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=337.86s)]
*  I'll give you one simple example. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=344.18s)]
*  What happened during the administration with President Trump when we killed Soleimani? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=346.7s)]
*  Very clear. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=350.06s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=351.06s)]
*  We killed Soleimani and things quieted down. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=352.06s)]
*  We took out one key leader. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  I'll give you another good example. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  When we were having peace discussions with the Taliban and President Trump, and I was [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=357.58s)]
*  in the Oval Office when we talked to Mueller Barraga, who is a leader of the Taliban, it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=362.08s)]
*  was translated, and I sat there wondering, boy, how is this being translated? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  But we said very clearly what we were going to do to him and the Taliban if something [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=370.53999999999996s)]
*  happened. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=374.62s)]
*  In the discussion, not a single American was killed in over a year in Afghanistan. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=376.54s)]
*  You send a certain message to certain people, they receive the message because they believe [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=380.98s)]
*  you're serious. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=384.74s)]
*  So I can give you—we can spend an hour if you want to. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=385.74s)]
*  I can give you a historical example, from the Third Punic War to currently, where it [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=388.82s)]
*  goes, what you do with leadership. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=395.1s)]
*  But it makes a hard decision to do it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=396.82s)]
*  But you've got to make that call sometimes. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=398.26s)]
*  That doesn't mean you totally bomb Iran, but you are very selective in your targeting, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=400.42s)]
*  and it needs to be done. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=404.5s)]
*  So, General, thanks for joining us. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=406.38s)]
*  So I guess my question to sort of pick up where Will left off is this idea that if we [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=407.38s)]
*  decide that we're going to preemptively strike in Iran, right, are you saying that we do [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=411.82s)]
*  not—you do not believe that the Iranians would retaliate in some sort of way, given [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=417.26s)]
*  the fact that we have a lot of troops in that region? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=420.82s)]
*  And I think we said earlier in the show, many of them are there in bases that we already [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=423.18s)]
*  lost three there, we've already injured. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=427.5s)]
*  Are we saying that there's no potential for the Iranians to strike back and hurt American [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=429.54s)]
*  troops on the ground there? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=433.26s)]
*  Of course there is, Richard. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=434.82000000000005s)]
*  But I'll take issue with one word you used. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=437.02000000000004s)]
*  For us to preemptively attack Iran, they've been attacking us for the last 90 days. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=439.62s)]
*  Could you be very clear on something? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=444.1s)]
*  They've been striking an all-out facility. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=445.1s)]
*  Within the borders of Iran. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=446.1s)]
*  They're security forces. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=447.1s)]
*  And we would go after them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=448.1s)]
*  Of course we would have to accept that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=449.66s)]
*  That's the risk level, not a gamble. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=451.3s)]
*  But there's a risk level you take. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=453.54s)]
*  But you make sure they understand, if you want to dance with the bear, the United States [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=455.3s)]
*  being the bear, we will decide when the dance stops, not you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=459.38s)]
*  And you make that hard call. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=463.66s)]
*  Look, I'm not big on starting a war. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=464.94s)]
*  I've had kids in the military. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=467.06s)]
*  I've been in the military. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  But I also understand what you have to do to establish some level of deterrence in the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=469.72s)]
*  world and in the region. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=474.66s)]
*  And we're not there yet. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=476.16s)]
*  And you have to establish that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=477.64000000000004s)]
*  If not, you're heading for a larger war, more conflict, more deaths, more Americans [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=478.86s)]
*  have been lost. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=483.90000000000003s)]
*  We've been dodging a bullet for the last 90 days. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  It finally hit home with the deaths of three great Americans. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=487.22s)]
*  And that could continue into the future. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=490.42s)]
*  This thing has not stopped, not at all. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=492.18s)]
*  And I would like to know what is the end state of this contingency plan that the United States [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  has established with all this bombing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=498.86s)]
*  I don't know where they're going to. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=501.02s)]
*  They need to tell us. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=502.5s)]
*  Well, they called a lid, so I don't think we're going to get that tonight. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=503.5s)]
*  Thank you, General Kellogg. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=505.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's bring it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQ1K6eCL7I&t=507.22s)]
