# ‘The Five’: Democrats face yet another 'dumpster fire'
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw)
*  Happy St. Patrick's Day, America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=0.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's no luck of the Irish for the Democrat Party, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=3.04s)]
*  who seem to have hit shamrock bottom in two new polls. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=7.28s)]
*  NBC finding 55% of Americans have a negative view of the Democrats, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  and CNN is echoing that with 54% viewing the party unfavorably. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=17.2s)]
*  But it looks like President Trump has found the pot of gold. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=23.6s)]
*  47 is hitting his highest approval that he's ever had as commander in chief, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=27.72s)]
*  and he's got more Americans than ever saying that the country is headed in the right direction. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=33.32s)]
*  First of all, the mood of the country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  This really jumped out. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=41.2s)]
*  We asked folks, is it on the right direction or the wrong direction? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=42.28s)]
*  That 44% who say right direction, that's up since November. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  And if that doesn't seem like a lot, the last time it cracked 40%, you got to go back to 2012. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=49.08s)]
*  The last time it actually hit 44 or higher, January of 2004. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=54.32s)]
*  And while President Trump soars with the united Republican Party at his side, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=59.8s)]
*  the angry Democrats are tearing each other down in a full-blown civil war. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=65.72s)]
*  The loonies are now making Chuck Schumer the scapegoat [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=70.64s)]
*  after he caved and backed the Republican spending bill. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=74.12s)]
*  You know why Dems suck at messaging? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=77.48s)]
*  Because they never talking about nothing, and they do nothing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  The idea that Chuck Schumer is the only one that's got a brain in the room, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=83.84s)]
*  and the only one that can think through all of the pros and cons is absolutely ridiculous. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=88.12s)]
*  I've never seen this level of volcanic anger at a Democrat ever. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  I think Chuck Schumer has radically misread the room. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=96.04s)]
*  I'm pissed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=99.48s)]
*  Okay, so you know, there's actually little that the Senate minority leader can say, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=100.88s)]
*  and the 10 Democrats that voted with the Republicans can say, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=109.76s)]
*  to appease somebody like me, I'm going to change my registration to independent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=112.72s)]
*  Aha, Chris Matthews isn't feeling that thrill up his leg [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=115.96s)]
*  over a familiar face making fun of the Democrats. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=120.32s)]
*  They laugh in a kind of a humiliating way about their opponents, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=124.52s)]
*  instead of, you know, George Gutfeld at night. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=128.44s)]
*  All it is is making fun of Democrats. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=130.52s)]
*  Yeah, if you're triggered, I don't want to hear it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=132.4s)]
*  I want to hear the facts. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=134.48s)]
*  And meanwhile, the Democrats are doubling down on the radical wing of the party [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=137.24s)]
*  that could sink them for good. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=141.72s)]
*  AOC is leading the pack of potential leaders of the Democrat party. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=144.16s)]
*  All right, Greg, I'll start with you, seeing as Chris Matthews is not too happy with you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=148.56s)]
*  He says that you are humiliating the Democrats. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=153.0s)]
*  You know, when you lose Chris Matthews, it's time to retire, America. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=156.16s)]
*  I thought that was a compliment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=160.88s)]
*  You know that he'd never heard of the show before until he'd heard about it on NPR, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=162.24s)]
*  and now he has the outlaw laughing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=166.12s)]
*  I said this before. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=167.88s)]
*  If you're the neighbor that is living next door to somebody throwing a party, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=169.08s)]
*  do you call the police on them or do you go over there, introduce yourself, say hello, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=174.68s)]
*  and say, hey, do you think you can turn it down a little? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=179.56s)]
*  They're the neighbor that calls the police. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=181.28s)]
*  They want to have fun, but they just can't. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=182.84s)]
*  I think, you know, what you're seeing, again, is the consequences of identity politics. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=185.84s)]
*  They thought that expanding the tent by, like, kind of like just getting all these identities together, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  create little boxes, stack them on top of each other, that would work. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=197.64s)]
*  But what happened is by adding one box, three left, they became a sanctuary for silliness. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=201.64s)]
*  You know, if you start, you know, we're so inclusive. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=207.76s)]
*  We believe men should be in girls' locker rooms. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=210.64s)]
*  We support Hamas supporters. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  We don't want you to deport gangs in American cities to their countries that they came from. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=214.6s)]
*  We back every recidivist criminal and every race hoaxer. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=218.92s)]
*  What happens is by inclusivity, you excluded the normal people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=222.2s)]
*  and they wanted to get the hell out of here pretty soon. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=226.72s)]
*  The face of your party became the hysterical activist screaming on behalf of Hamas at Columbia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=228.72s)]
*  So you know what it reminds me of? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=235.32s)]
*  It reminds me of those women who write letters to men on death row and then they marry one of them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=236.96s)]
*  You know, their maternal compassion gets hijacked. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=244.88s)]
*  Used to be animal rights, you know, but now it's militants and trans. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=248.8s)]
*  And when you hear the chants on campus, it's all predominantly female voices. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=253.44s)]
*  The party has become the troubled, lonely woman who marries a mass murderer and they're stuck with them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=258.88s)]
*  The party's got to realize and, you know, they got to realize that compassion is not compassion. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=265.88s)]
*  If you're if it's for the wrong thing, true compassion is telling somebody who's doing a bad thing not to do it, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=274.0s)]
*  which is what we've been doing for. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=279.64s)]
*  This is the heart of compassion for the Democratic Party. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=281.24s)]
*  The Dems, real. No, it's true. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=283.68s)]
*  We've been telling them, no, stop that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=285.32s)]
*  But now they have no Plan B, which is ironic. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=287.52s)]
*  OK, all right, Brian, given the apparent disconnect between the public and the positive view of the direction that the country's going [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=291.88s)]
*  and the negative view of the media and the Democrats, is this like signaling like a larger shift in politics in America? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=300.96s)]
*  I think so, because the Democrats really have no way of addressing they're not realizing the Republicans are addressing a problem. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, whether you like it or not, Social Security is going to go bankrupt in a few years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Whether you like it or not, the Medicare formula for giving people health care has got to be reformed right away. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=317.88s)]
*  The deficit is a problem at seven point two percent of all our revenue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  These have to be addressed. It's not my idea. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=327.04s)]
*  This is an emergency five alarm fire. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  So what the Republicans are doing is saying, OK, this is how we're doing it, this is how we're doing it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=331.72s)]
*  And all they're saying is, what a bad what a bunch of bad people. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=335.12s)]
*  And isn't Donald Trump awful? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=338.24s)]
*  I mean, we have to find a way to build a ship in under five years. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=339.84s)]
*  We can't do that anymore. If Democrats have a better way to do that, let's hear it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  So enough of the personality. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=346.8s)]
*  I know you're obsessed with Donald Trump, but he's gone in three and a half years. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=348.4s)]
*  Right. Three years, three and three quarter years. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=352.24s)]
*  You have to have your own plan. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=354.44s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer, I hate to say it, the New York Post is right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=356.52s)]
*  He had no choice. He had to do this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, for them to unload on this guy when he was absolutely he lost the day [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=362.72s)]
*  the speaker passed the bill on a party line vote, except for Jared Golden and one other voter and and and Massey. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=367.56s)]
*  For me, Schumer actually did the right thing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=375.88s)]
*  Mitch McConnell would have done the same thing because you lost. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  You lost on Election Day. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=381.88s)]
*  You lost both houses and the White House. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=384.04s)]
*  And then you lost when Speaker Johnson did his job. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  So if you if you went ahead and did what they wanted, Donald Trump would be laughing all weekend. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=388.6s)]
*  That's right. He'd be like, I'm funding everything I want and not funding anything. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=394.36s)]
*  And it's all your fault, Democrats. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  So he had no choice. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, Dana, Simone Sanders was so disgusted. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=402.04s)]
*  And, you know, she by being angry, it's like we can say Schumer did the right thing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=406.0s)]
*  But it's like she's ignoring the fact that if the Democrats don't like Doge, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  they were giving Donald Trump the ability to doge the whole government by saying who is considered an essential worker and who isn't. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=416.76s)]
*  Yeah, anger is not going to get you very far. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=425.0s)]
*  But I do understand one reason why they're angry with Chuck Schumer, because he gave the impression all week long that he was going to vote against it up until Thursday night. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=428.48s)]
*  And then all of a sudden on Friday, he changes his tune. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=438.0s)]
*  And I think that was the anger. The smart leadership thing, leader position should have been [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  we actually don't have the votes, guys, and it could be really bad for us. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=446.32s)]
*  We are going to live to fight another day. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=450.0s)]
*  Stick with me on this one. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  When they try to pass all these tax cuts for the rich, then I'm going to then we will go and mass. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=454.44s)]
*  But right now, this is not the fight that we knew. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  He didn't do any of that because he can't do any of that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=461.28s)]
*  And the sad thing is for the Democrats, it's very grim when Chuck Schumer is your voice of reason. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  Things are so bad for them that he wrote a book about anti-Semitism that he cannot promote. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=470.08s)]
*  It comes out tomorrow. He's canceled the entire book tour, not because the right's going to protest him, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  but because he was going to get protested on the left. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=479.8s)]
*  And so therefore you can't even talk about anti-Semitism. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=482.44000000000005s)]
*  Plus, the other thing is when you look at the media that we showed here, like the I would say liberal leaning, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  but even the Democrats on the media panels, they seem to look at all of this polling that's devastating for Democrats and say, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=491.32000000000005s)]
*  yep, we're exactly right in all of our positions. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  And then they continue to do the same thing over and over again. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  Chris Murphy was on TV saying the polling shows we need to fight Trump harder. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=504.04s)]
*  He didn't say fight him smarter, they just fight them harder. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=509.04s)]
*  Yeah. You know, the interesting thing is one of the things that we saw today is that AOC is kind of leading the pack [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=512.44s)]
*  in terms of who is the leader of the Democrat Party. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=518.96s)]
*  I mean, you know, what does she have to do, I mean, to actually get the public trust back in the Democrat Party? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=521.28s)]
*  Well, I think that what you're seeing in AOC being the leader on that poll, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=528.48s)]
*  and it's only by one percentage point, is that Democrats are desperate for somebody who has fight in them. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=532.04s)]
*  They don't actually really care what their politics are. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=536.52s)]
*  And that was the most interesting finding from the NBC poll this weekend. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=538.92s)]
*  So in April 2017, when Trump had just come in for the first time, 59 percent of Democrats wanted their party to work with Trump. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=542.64s)]
*  Only 33 percent said stick to your positions, even if that means that Washington doesn't work. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=549.76s)]
*  Now, 65 percent want Democrats to stick to their positions, even if they don't accomplish things because they want some pushback. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=554.56s)]
*  And that is where Chuck Schumer failed in this. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=562.52s)]
*  We have known that March 14th was the day that we were going to have to vote on this bill for months. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=564.4799999999999s)]
*  There was not enough preparation getting to this point. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=570.88s)]
*  They could have branded whatever the CR was going to look like. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=573.4s)]
*  They could have said, you know what this is? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=576.52s)]
*  This is going to be doge on steroids. Right. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=578.04s)]
*  They didn't do that. And then on top of it, they didn't propose their own CR. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  You could have come out and said, this is what we want to bring to the table. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=585.12s)]
*  These are our priorities. It should be bipartisan to keep the government open. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=588.04s)]
*  Let's do X, Y and Z. Are these the amendments that we have to have? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=591.9599999999999s)]
*  The Republicans have done that successfully before they did in 2021. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  They filibustered and they got some of what they wanted. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=598.28s)]
*  You're not in control, so it's not going to be perfect. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=600.88s)]
*  But I really think it's about being a fighter and showing that you're not just going to capitulate to whatever they want. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=603.28s)]
*  And yeah, of course, it's a good thing for Trump if he has this 47 percent approval highest, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  but also his disapproval is the highest he's ever had in the NBC poll as well at 51 percent. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  It's the highest percentage of people who think that their business outcome for the next year is at the highest level since 1980. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=619.7199999999999s)]
*  He's underwater on every category except handling immigration. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=626.56s)]
*  There are openings for Democrats to be doing well at this moment. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=630.04s)]
*  And we're up on the generic ballot. If you know Trump so great, then why do you want Democrats to control Congress? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=633.68s)]
*  The problem is that the Democrats are suffering from Trump's Arrangement Syndrome. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=638.56s)]
*  Well, that's the D block. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  How about those egg prices, huh? Gas prices, Jessica. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=644.16s)]
*  They've been exploding on eggs all weekend. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=647.9599999999999s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=651.16s)]
*  I ate eggs all weekend. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=652.16s)]
*  You did? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=653.16s)]
*  Up next. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xKIPZ0Wfw&t=653.76s)]
