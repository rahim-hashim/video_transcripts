# Dems are raging against the ‘waste management wizards’: Watters
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ)
*  I will lift you up when they push you down. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I will raise my voice and stand my ground. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=4.2s)]
*  Well, it looks like it might be a hard road, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=7.92s)]
*  but I'm gonna walk it with you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=11.88s)]
*  The Democrats' anti-Doge choir's back with a fresh new track [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=14.68s)]
*  that's almost as painful as Greg's bump in music. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=18.48s)]
*  Those liberal lunatics capping off another week [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  of anti-Elon rallies raging against [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=23.6s)]
*  the waste management wizards. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=26.28s)]
*  Doge now has a website that's keeping score [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=28.4s)]
*  and all the governments slopped their digging up. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=30.88s)]
*  Case in point, the Department of Education [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=33.28s)]
*  just had to slash grants to four equity assistance centers, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=35.44s)]
*  blowing $33 million of your taxpayer cash. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=39.8s)]
*  On things like this workshop on whiteness. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=43.44s)]
*  Today's virtual round table is entitled [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=47.36s)]
*  Identifying and Disrupting Your Whiteness, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=49.96s)]
*  a Workshop Addressing Power and Privilege [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=52.68s)]
*  Toward Anti-Racist Spaces. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=55.16s)]
*  And we just got an exclusive clip. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=58.48s)]
*  Sean Hannity sitting down with President Trump [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  and Elon Musk for their first joint interview. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=62.92s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=65.6s)]
*  You're both aware, you have to be keenly aware [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=67.6s)]
*  that the media and the punditry class, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=71.12s)]
*  not that, you know, I think you've proven [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=75.24s)]
*  they have no power anymore. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=77.24s)]
*  Because they threw everything they had at you [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=79.28s)]
*  and they didn't win. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=80.92s)]
*  And that was, you know, The New York Times, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=82.12s)]
*  Washington Post, three networks, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=84.64s)]
*  every late night comedy show, two cable channels. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=86.84s)]
*  They just threw everything, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=89.56s)]
*  lawfare, weaponization. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=91.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=93.0s)]
*  And now I see, they want you two to start, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=94.56s)]
*  they want a divorce. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=98.4s)]
*  They want you two to start hating each other [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=99.44s)]
*  and they try, oh, President Elon Musk, for example. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=101.92s)]
*  You do know that they're doing that to you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=105.68s)]
*  Oh, I see it all the time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=107.64s)]
*  They tried it, then they stopped. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=108.72s)]
*  That wasn't, they have many different things of hatred. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=110.64s)]
*  Actually, Elon called me, he said, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=114.06s)]
*  you know, they're trying to drive us apart. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=117.36s)]
*  I said, absolutely. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=118.44s)]
*  No, they said, we have breaking news. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=119.72s)]
*  Donald Trump has ceded control of the presidency [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=121.88s)]
*  to Elon Musk. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=125.0s)]
*  President Musk will be attending a cabinet meeting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=126.56s)]
*  tonight at eight o'clock. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=129.44s)]
*  And I say, it's just so obvious. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=131.16s)]
*  They're so bad at it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=133.44s)]
*  I used to think they were good at it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  They're actually bad at it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=136.04s)]
*  Because if they were good at it, I'd never be president. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=137.16s)]
*  Because I think nobody in history [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=140.04s)]
*  has ever gotten more bad publicity than me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  I could do the greatest things. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=144.76s)]
*  I get 98% bad publicity. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=146.92s)]
*  I could do, outside of you and a few of your [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=149.0s)]
*  very good friends, it's like the craziest thing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  But you know what I have learned, Elon? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=154.64s)]
*  The people are smart, they get it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=156.2s)]
*  Yeah, they do, actually. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  They get it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=159.2s)]
*  They really see what's happening. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=161.56s)]
*  That interview airs next Tuesday at nine o'clock Eastern. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=163.28s)]
*  All right, Judge Jeanine, more singing from the Democrats. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  Are you enjoying that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  I have to tell you that there is no better way [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=171.56s)]
*  for the Democrats to continue to destroy themselves [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=174.88s)]
*  than to continue on this mission that they have [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=178.0s)]
*  with the F Trump and F Elon and the singing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=181.0s)]
*  When the American people are like, we get this, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=185.0s)]
*  just the way the president Trump was saying, we get this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=187.84s)]
*  We wanna know where all the expenditures are going. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=191.2s)]
*  I just said to someone, did you know that $22 billion [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  went to illegals from Joe Biden over two years? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=197.76s)]
*  I think actually a year and a half for them to buy a house [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=200.84s)]
*  and buy a car and start a business when senior citizens [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=205.24s)]
*  and veterans are homeless or trying to figure out [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=209.56s)]
*  medication or food. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=212.96s)]
*  So I just hope the Democrats continue to go down that road. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=214.72s)]
*  Now, 14 attorney generals across the country are now suing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=217.62s)]
*  saying that Elon Musk doing this is a violation [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=222.44s)]
*  of the Appointments Clause and he lacks Senate confirmation [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=225.28s)]
*  and he's got too much private information at his hands. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=230.56s)]
*  You know what, it's nothing more than politically motivated [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=234.16s)]
*  attempt to destroy and hide because as a prosecutor, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=240.2s)]
*  I say to myself, like who is against exposing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=243.2s)]
*  fraud and corruption? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=246.2s)]
*  Okay, the ones who are at risk of being charged [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=248.0s)]
*  with fraud and corruption. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=251.04s)]
*  And the ones who favor are bureaucracy [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=252.62s)]
*  and let the Dems do it, they'll lose again. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=257.04s)]
*  We're seeing polling in Arizona from swing state people. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=259.56s)]
*  Kennedy, they want them to keep going. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=263.12s)]
*  They say keep cutting, they love it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  And it was actually a very interesting polling group [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=267.52s)]
*  because it was people who had voted for Biden in 2020 [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=269.76s)]
*  who then switched their votes to Trump in 2024 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=273.08s)]
*  because Bidenomics as was the case for most people [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=275.84s)]
*  in the country, it didn't work out for them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=279.0s)]
*  So it didn't work out for them because their taxes [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=281.68s)]
*  are too high, eggs are too expensive, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  people still are having a hard time [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  making mortgage payments and paying the rent [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=289.12s)]
*  and affording college and everything else. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=291.84s)]
*  So now they're realizing where that hard earned tax money [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  is actually going. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=297.84s)]
*  And the more we hear about $160 million going to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=299.12s)]
*  a Canadian electric school bus factory [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  that has now declared bankruptcy and never made good [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=305.5s)]
*  on their promise to deliver school buses, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  100 million of them to 55 school districts in the country. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=310.44s)]
*  It's like, that's where my money has gone. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=314.32s)]
*  They actually want more of it [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=316.29999999999995s)]
*  because the feeling is if you cut out entire departments [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=318.12s)]
*  and if you shed sunlight on all of this waste and abuse, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=321.64s)]
*  then maybe taxes will finally come down, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=326.82s)]
*  then maybe federal expenditures will come down. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=328.92s)]
*  And I'm shocked that Democrats haven't gotten on board [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=331.56s)]
*  with this and gone, you know what, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=334.32s)]
*  we're not helping people if we're swirling this money away [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=335.92s)]
*  to projects that do absolutely nothing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=339.1s)]
*  We're Democrats, we're the party of the working man. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=341.48s)]
*  So let's fared out the abuse and find better, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=344.24s)]
*  less expensive ways to truly help people, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=348.72s)]
*  but they're not doing that and that's dumb. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=350.44s)]
*  Why can't they just have a reasonable position, Harold, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=351.92s)]
*  where they thread the needle and say, yeah, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=354.72s)]
*  we don't need the sex changes for the Guatemalans. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=356.24s)]
*  You know, we don't need the DEI operas, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=359.2s)]
*  but maybe we could just do this in a little bit [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=362.16s)]
*  of a more constitutional way. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=364.92s)]
*  Good to be with you, Kennedy, good to see you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=367.92s)]
*  I think at Happy Valentine's Day, I think a couple things. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, Harold, thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=372.36s)]
*  I didn't think we were at that level. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=375.0s)]
*  We're not, nor will we ever be, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=377.2s)]
*  but I was really wishing all of the viewers [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=378.56s)]
*  a Happy Valentine's Day. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=380.32s)]
*  I'd say, I think that Kennedy touches on something [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  with the Arizona swing voters. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  And Democrats need to be mindful. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  These were Democrats, or at least voted Democrat, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=388.2s)]
*  then voted Republican this last go round, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=390.36s)]
*  how they're perceiving this and how they're evaluating. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=392.8s)]
*  This is the group that Democrats, I think, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=395.8s)]
*  those that are singing outside the agencies [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  and outside the Capitol, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=400.72s)]
*  I think this is the group they're trying to appeal to, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=401.84s)]
*  but they're not. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  A separate survey that Gallup conducted [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=405.2s)]
*  showed that 45% of Democrats think [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=407.64s)]
*  that Democrats need to be more moderate. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=409.88s)]
*  It's an 11 point increase from just three or four years ago. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=411.52s)]
*  These are the things we should be taking note of. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=414.84s)]
*  Now, what President Trump and Mr. Musk and others [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=417.4s)]
*  are doing with this Doge and some of the other things, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=421.35999999999996s)]
*  this is not a sprint, this is a marathon. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=424.44s)]
*  This is only four weeks in here. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  We've got a long way to go. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  Democrats, if you are serious about [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=428.76s)]
*  wanting to reform government, then offer your own ideas. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=431.56s)]
*  Offer other ideas to make government [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  operate more efficiently. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=436.88s)]
*  Offer more ideas to help cut spending [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=437.96s)]
*  and to bring our deficit down [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=440.32s)]
*  and to help tackle this enormous 36 [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=442.24s)]
*  or 37 trillion dollar deficit that we have. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  I think Donald Trump knows something as well. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  If we're six months from today, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  or when we're six months from today, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=453.08s)]
*  and he is still not engaging Congress, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  I think right now not engaging Congress is serving him well. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=457.56s)]
*  Democrat, Republican alike, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=460.76000000000005s)]
*  they can't wrap their heads around the speed [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=462.24s)]
*  and the scale in which he is operating at this point. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  But if you, in that same poll of Arizona voters, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=468.0s)]
*  it showed that people are giving the president [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=470.24s)]
*  a little latitude and benefit of the doubt on inflation. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=472.20000000000005s)]
*  If we find ourselves with high prices like we have today, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=474.72s)]
*  six months from now, eight months from now, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=478.04s)]
*  and Republicans can't come together in the House [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=480.20000000000005s)]
*  and the Senate around a border security bill, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=482.44000000000005s)]
*  which they seem to be squabbling about right now, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  even a long-term budget deal, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=486.88000000000005s)]
*  we may have a different conversation. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  But as we sit here today, Jesse, I agree with you, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=490.56s)]
*  and I agree with Kennedy, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=492.64s)]
*  this is not a moment to be singing outside of agencies. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=493.68s)]
*  This is a moment to get serious about a plan, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=497.4s)]
*  about a set of ideas, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=500.12s)]
*  and frankly, how we would make government [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=501.96s)]
*  operate more efficiently. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=504.32s)]
*  If you could doze one thing at this table, Harold, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  would it be Greg's collar? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=508.56s)]
*  I like Greg's collar. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=511.2s)]
*  I'd let him doze it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=512.12s)]
*  I'd help him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=513.28s)]
*  Doze, doze, doze. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=515.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=516.32s)]
*  Greg? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=517.16s)]
*  Jesse. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=519.04s)]
*  How are you feeling today? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=519.88s)]
*  I'm feeling great. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=520.72s)]
*  You look great. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=521.56s)]
*  And thank you for the chocolate. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=522.38s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=523.22s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=524.06s)]
*  I know Belgium's your favorite. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=524.88s)]
*  You know, you asked Harold about, you know, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=525.72s)]
*  can they do a reasonable position? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=526.96s)]
*  It's hard because that lane is taken. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=528.48s)]
*  When you say reasonable position, you mean common sense. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=531.24s)]
*  So that's the high ground, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=533.48s)]
*  and there's nothing around a high ground. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=535.0s)]
*  I'm not interested in saying that the Democrats suck. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=537.24s)]
*  Leave that to outnumbered. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=540.24s)]
*  I say, I say right now you suck, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=542.32s)]
*  but here's what you gotta do to get out of it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=545.36s)]
*  I think a lot of Dems, you know, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=547.6s)]
*  people watch this show, Democrats, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=549.52s)]
*  there are more Democrats watching this show [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=551.12s)]
*  than CNN and MSNBC combined. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=552.48s)]
*  So they come here for some kind of free therapy, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=555.28s)]
*  and I'm here to give it to you [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=558.6s)]
*  because I actually want them to join us. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=559.8s)]
*  And the Democrats have a choice to join the good guys [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=562.6s)]
*  or become a Bond villain. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  Because if you're gonna defend waste, fraud, and abuse, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=567.96s)]
*  you are basically embracing the life of a Bond villain. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=570.12s)]
*  Actually, it's worse than that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=573.04s)]
*  It's like it is, you ever watch the zombie movie [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=574.64s)]
*  and you go like, you know, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  it would be just so much easier to get bitten [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=578.08s)]
*  and become a zombie, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=580.6s)]
*  because then you're no longer terrified. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=582.08s)]
*  Ever considered that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I do that all the time. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=584.72s)]
*  I go like, just get bitten. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what I think a lot of Dems are doing [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  is that they're embracing a role that is just easier, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=590.12s)]
*  but it forbids them from ever becoming the good guy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  They're becoming a zombie. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think this is a bigger moment [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=598.72s)]
*  than maybe most people realize. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=600.44s)]
*  This is, I think, the biggest political moment [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=603.6400000000001s)]
*  since the fall of communism. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=605.72s)]
*  In that case, that end was definitive. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=607.2s)]
*  The wall comes down, USSR dissolves. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=609.1600000000001s)]
*  Suddenly communism just evaporates, except in colleges. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=611.48s)]
*  For the Democrats, the wall has come down. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  And many of their leaders sense [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=618.1600000000001s)]
*  that the Democrat party of before is dead. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=620.6s)]
*  It's not in need of a rebrand, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  it's in need of a full body and mind transplant. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  And it's really hard to do that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=629.1600000000001s)]
*  when you still have that stuff. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=631.76s)]
*  The singing, the equity, the DEI, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=633.36s)]
*  I don't think you can underestimate how wokeness, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  which is fueled by identity politics, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=640.32s)]
*  essentially cultural Marxism, infected the party [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=642.12s)]
*  and ate it out, devoured it from the inside. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=645.96s)]
*  In a way, it's very similar to what happened to USSR, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=649.88s)]
*  except it happened to a party, not a country. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=652.7600000000001s)]
*  So I think that the Dems, my advice is to stop thinking [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=655.4000000000001s)]
*  about the role as an adversary to Trump. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  You have to ask yourself, what are we? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=663.04s)]
*  You may find out that you're not anything anymore. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=664.88s)]
*  And then they have to decide, what does that mean? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=668.0s)]
*  Do I leave this party? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=669.76s)]
*  Do we start something new? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=672.92s)]
*  What would that new thing be? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=674.12s)]
*  Because it's really hard to find [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=675.68s)]
*  an oppositional point to Trump, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  because he's neither conservative, right? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=679.24s)]
*  He's neither liberal. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=682.04s)]
*  He's basically a populist. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=683.4s)]
*  And it's hard to get footing [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=685.92s)]
*  when the guy's picking 80, 20 popular issues. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=687.68s)]
*  It's like, like when you said, a reasonable position, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=691.0s)]
*  every one of them is taken. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=693.76s)]
*  And you're welcoming Democrats [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=696.56s)]
*  to go on this road of self-discovery here on The Five. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=697.96s)]
*  I think that it's very hard to join the good guys [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=701.08s)]
*  if it's a blow to your ego and the opportunity costs [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=705.48s)]
*  that you've already dropped into your side. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=708.24s)]
*  Greg, I can give you even more credit. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=710.24s)]
*  I think it's the Republican Party and Democrat Party, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=711.24s)]
*  as we know it today, that is, flummoxed, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=713.76s)]
*  and frankly, has to reinvent itself. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=715.76s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=717.12s)]
*  And it's Trump that's gonna organize it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=717.96s)]
*  It's bigger than we ever thought. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=719.68s)]
*  Well, if you want more of that beautiful interview [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=721.9599999999999s)]
*  between Elon Musk, Sean Hannity, and Donald Trump, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  9 o'clock Eastern Tuesday, check it out. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=727.76s)]
*  But up next, Democrats, the less Chuck Schumer [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=731.28s)]
*  and more Chuck Norris. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNGxsR6cRQ&t=733.9599999999999s)]
