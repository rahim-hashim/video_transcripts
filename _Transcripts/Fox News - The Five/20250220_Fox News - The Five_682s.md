# Gutfeld likens DOGE to Robin Hood
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg)
*  on in his Doge wrecking crew about to blow up the most despised government agency in the land. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=0.0s)]
*  Word is the IRS is about to mass fire nearly 7,000 audit loving pencil pushing workers from their [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=5.04s)]
*  roster. Musk telling Hannity that he had no choice but to pursue the Doge cuts. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  As the president said like this there's a lot of rich people out there [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=17.52s)]
*  they should be caring more about the country because the reason they should be caring about [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=22.96s)]
*  more about the countries if America falls what do you think is going to happen to your business? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=26.8s)]
*  What do you think do you think are we going to be okay if the ship of America sinks? Of course not [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=30.64s)]
*  like what what what what I'm doing here what the president's doing is it's just long-term thinking [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=36.0s)]
*  the ship of America must be strong ship of America cannot sink if it sinks we all sink with it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=42.4s)]
*  But there could be a big beautiful payoff for the American people if Doge is successful. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=48.96s)]
*  Musk is mulling $5,000 Doge dividend checks funded by the savings from his department of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=53.76s)]
*  government efficiency. 47 seems on board but some Democrats aren't sold. There's even [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=59.44s)]
*  under consideration a new concept where we give 20 percent of the Doge savings to American citizens [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=67.12s)]
*  and 20 percent goes to paying down debt because the numbers are incredible Elon so many billions [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=73.2s)]
*  of billions hundreds of billions and we're thinking about giving 20 percent back to the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=79.76s)]
*  American citizens. We are not in the business of giving out money and honestly I don't know [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  what $5,000 will do for you. Now Harold that woman Jasmine Crockett praised the Stimmi checks [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  back in the day and now she says what are you gonna do with five grand? Look I said yesterday that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=101.84s)]
*  um paying down the debt should be the first priority if you pay down the debt you actually [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=108.0s)]
*  make it make it more make it possible for more dollars to be lent to private companies because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=113.6s)]
*  they're not the public debt is not crowding that dollar we pay a trillion dollars almost in interest [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=120.4s)]
*  on our debt if you're able to reduce that that reduces government spending that's that's the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  third fourth most expensive thing government does the $5,000 checks I love the idea I think you [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=129.6s)]
*  should only send it to people who earn less than $150,000 a year sending $5,000 to a multi-millionaire [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=135.12s)]
*  here in New York or Boston or Philadelphia or New Jersey when we should be paying down our debt [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=141.68s)]
*  that to me is a bigger priority than all I appreciate what really reduces government spending [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=146.08s)]
*  when the government spends less Harold I appreciate right and when they save money [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=151.28s)]
*  you should pay their debt then we had the conversation yesterday I agreed I respected [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  your opinion yesterday I disagree with it totally but that is an opinion I don't think that paying [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  down the debt should be second to anything 36 trillion dollars your your kids and my kids and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=163.28s)]
*  our grandkids one day will be saddled continue to paying this down finally on what what Elon said [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=168.48s)]
*  about Doge it's unclear to me if the president and Mr. Musk are as thoughtful about I use the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=173.2s)]
*  word thoughtful to describe my pal Greg Gutfeld in this great article in variety here in the last [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  day so it's unclear if they're being thoughtful about all some of these cuts your buddy that got [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=186.8s)]
*  CDC CDC lost an office here in New York 9-eleven the survivors of 9-eleven lost one of their offices [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=192.88s)]
*  here in New York Republican and Democrat congressman in New York and New Jersey sent a letter [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=200.0s)]
*  to Mr. Kennedy today asking him to restore that and to open that office back up bipartisan why [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=204.48s)]
*  because I'm not it's not clear to me that they're looking at all of this in a way where they're [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  analyzing readiness where they're analyzing whether or not these dollars are being spent [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  effectively there's no doubt there's fraud and waste and inefficiencies I just hope they're more [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=218.32s)]
*  careful and more studious and fastidious as they go about making some of these cuts but giving some [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  money back to taxpayers earning under 150 000 a year and then paying down the debt that ought [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=228.16s)]
*  to be the priority all right judge you need well that's what he wants he said that's what the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=232.64s)]
*  president just said he said to everybody 20 oh you know what here's the bottom line I like it I think [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  I like the idea of giving five thousand dollars to everybody not because I want it or don't want it [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=242.48s)]
*  but let's do something across the board for everybody and let's let's cut down on the debt [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  the most important thing we've got to do is stop spending stop funding programs stop paying for [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=253.12s)]
*  things we shouldn't be paying for and today the president signed an executive order that directs [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=258.88s)]
*  all of the federal agencies to identify and eliminate programs currently providing benefits [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=264.0s)]
*  to illegals do you know how much money that's going to save we have spent so much money on [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=269.44s)]
*  illegals and on USAID and on duplicity I was a local DA I prosecuted medic Medicaid fraud [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=275.84s)]
*  let me explain something to you that was not my charge but it was so unbelievable I got hundreds [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=284.0s)]
*  or tens of millions of dollars and it's just it's low-hanging fruit that you can't say you have to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=290.32s)]
*  make sure we don't do this and don't do that let's just start from square one and then decide what [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=296.96s)]
*  is essential what is essential for the American government to survive and most of the stuff we [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=303.44s)]
*  have is just payback to people who did this for that person or this for another person [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=309.84s)]
*  and we've got to stop doing that and you know the IRS letting go of 6 000 employees I have no problem [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=315.84s)]
*  with that because Joe Biden between 2021 and 2024 put on 25 000 new IRS agents the only reason we [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=321.44s)]
*  even needed them was because of COVID nobody could figure out there was so much corruption [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=329.68s)]
*  who was getting paid and not paid so you know we can't start crying and saying oh we can't do this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=334.4s)]
*  let's just get it done go down the brass I'm not crying I'm only saying your guy should not have [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=340.8s)]
*  been fired well wait a minute the CDC office should have been the low hanging fruit of Medicare is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=345.36s)]
*  where they should have started that's all I'm saying there's a lot more money there that's all [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=349.2s)]
*  and I'm not crying real men don't cry okay the um the fired IRS agents are those the ones with the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=352.0s)]
*  guns Dana no well I don't know who they're one person I follow said that these roughly half of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=359.92s)]
*  them are the ones that go after well go after audit small business owners and the self-employed [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  and so but I just think I think we're kind of missing one point here that I would add to this [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=374.08s)]
*  discussion which is that don't forget it was Biden's inflation reduction act that added [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=378.56s)]
*  80 billion dollars in IRS funding and 90 000 more IRS agents so even with what they're saying that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=385.36s)]
*  they want to do with those the Biden IRA people still come out ahead for the IRS and the other [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=393.12s)]
*  thing is you are about to watch the Democrats add to their list of priorities defending the IRS [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=400.56s)]
*  so now they're gonna like they're like digging an even bigger hole for themselves yeah Harold [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=407.52s)]
*  I'm not saying that Harold's not doing it but keep crying our new friend Harold [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  Greg well I mean okay so this dividend this dividend is not right but it's persuasive [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=418.0s)]
*  yeah you know Doge wasn't supposed to be Robin Hood but everybody loves Robin Hood especially if [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=424.64s)]
*  he's robbing on behalf of you and Trump understands hey if the government's been ripping you off [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  and giving it to cronies maybe it's time we get in on the action Trump is like Omar in the wire [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=436.56s)]
*  stealing from the drug dealers I get the idea but it's not going to help solve the debt crisis [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=442.0s)]
*  unless yes you look at it long term and this is where I I straddle the fence oh and it hurts [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=447.92s)]
*  that's not you that's not the way you roll you never okay so looking at this long term how do [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=454.72s)]
*  you keep the public supportive of Doge over time because I'm suffering from dead Doge exhaustion [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=461.2s)]
*  disorder I wake up every morning it's like getting a new puppy every day I love it but after 20 [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=467.92s)]
*  puppies I mean come on but you know what you know what's amazing Trump fulfilled the most outrageous [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=472.96s)]
*  boast he ever made you're going to win so much you're going to get tired of winning and it's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=479.68s)]
*  actually happening I mean I don't maybe he knew that was going to happen but you know so here's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=486.4s)]
*  the deal the dividend will keep supporters so you can continue with Doge after Trump it's a bribe [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  but at least it's going to the citizens who've been ripped off and not some graduate of Brown [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=500.4s)]
*  who's getting their you know student loan cancelled in order to vote for Biden we went through that so [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  it's not right it's persuasive you know it if it's right you devoted to preventing financial ruin [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=510.88s)]
*  if it's persuasive you try to do that while giving the public a fat green bone that's what you want [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  that's what you want in the end back to you there's no counter argument right now that you know they're [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=524.8s)]
*  losing on Doge already you had a Doge dividend I mean that's going to be more popular than women [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=531.04s)]
*  of the Bible cookbook why is giving your money back a bribe [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=536.96s)]
*  well I guess what I'm trying to say is we are looking at the budget so they should we have to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  we have to shrink the government so you lower interest rates so that you can jump start the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=552.88s)]
*  economy and then they'll get their money back sure you can give them their money it is their money [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=557.76s)]
*  but you're not doing in 10 years when you know our expenditures will be seven times what we bring [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=563.76s)]
*  in there won't be a country left Jesse how will you afford your hair gel you're you're talking [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=569.28s)]
*  about 55 billion that they saved already compared to the trillions congress is spending if congress [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=574.24s)]
*  takes in seven trillion dollars in revenues and they spend nine trillion that's where the real [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=581.92s)]
*  savings are can I add one thing yeah it's like if you have let's say that there's a person that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=589.36s)]
*  has a lot of credit card debt and then if they're at the office they all of a sudden find out they're [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=594.72s)]
*  getting a bonus and it's a five thousand dollar bonus what you would tell that person is you [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=599.52s)]
*  should pay down the credit card debt so that you can start getting ahead in the future that would [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=604.8s)]
*  be in your face the other argument that's why the other 20 percent is so toward the deficit you also [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=610.3199999999999s)]

*  dollars that means you have to have 500 billion dollars so that's 20 percent that means they think [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=627.76s)]
*  they're going to save 2.5 trillion i'm just 100 million americans at five thousand dollars [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=632.4s)]
*  that means that's five billion dollars now i just i just lost you [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCz8DzVpcg&t=637.1999999999999s)]
