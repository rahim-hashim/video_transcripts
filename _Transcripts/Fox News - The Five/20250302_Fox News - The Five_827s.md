# Dems needed a script to succeed: Gutfeld
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8)
*  President Trump holding a blockbuster first cabinet meeting of his second term, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=0.0s)]
*  as he once again proves that he is the most transparent president in history. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=4.8s)]
*  A new analysis shows 47 is absolutely smoking his predecessors when it comes to talking to the media. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=10.16s)]
*  In just his first month, Trump took a staggering 1,000 questions compared to Sleepy Joe's sad, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=17.76s)]
*  measly 140. And that number was before today's hour-long juggernaut session, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=25.04s)]
*  where he answered more than 30 additional questions. The president convening the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=32.08s)]
*  heads of his executive departments and bringing along his Doge tech support, Elon Musk. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=36.8s)]
*  We have a mandate to do this and this is part of the reason I got elected. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=43.28s)]
*  It's not an optional thing, it is an essential thing. That's the reason I'm here [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=47.44s)]
*  and taking a lot of flack and getting a lot of death threats by the way. I mean like stack them up, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=53.76s)]
*  you know. But if we don't do this, America will go bankrupt. We bring the receipts, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=58.0s)]
*  so people say like, well is this real? Just go to doge.gov. Line item by line and we specify [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=64.16s)]
*  each item. So and we and I should say we also we will make mistakes. We won't be perfect, but when [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=70.24s)]
*  we make a mistake, we'll fix it very quickly. This country has gotten bloated and fat and disgusting [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=76.72s)]
*  and incompetently run. Musk also defending his now infamous Doge, name five things you did emails. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=83.6s)]
*  That email perhaps was best interpreted as a performance review, but actually it was a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=92.0s)]
*  pulse check review. Do you have a pulse? You have a pulse and two neurons. So if you have a pulse [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  and two neurons, you can reply to an email. Those million people that haven't responded though, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=104.88s)]
*  Elon, they are on the bubble. You know, I wouldn't say that we're thrilled about it. You know, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=108.88s)]
*  they haven't responded. Now maybe they don't exist. Maybe we're paying people that don't exist. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=115.36s)]
*  Maybe they're not around. Maybe they have other jobs. Meanwhile, critics of Doge are getting even [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=120.88s)]
*  more bizarre. The media is now fear mongering about how Doge cuts could lead people to be eaten by [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=126.96s)]
*  bears and liberal daily show host John Stewart got so worked up he drew blood. You want some [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=133.6s)]
*  information about the forest, maybe a good place to camp or trail to hike on, or maybe you're scared [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=140.64s)]
*  about bears. You come to a place like this, your local ranger station, but because of the recent [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=145.84s)]
*  firings, this one won't be open anytime soon. It would be embarrassing if it was a small drop in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=151.28s)]
*  the bucket and that the American people didn't expect that we should negotiate for all their [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=156.4s)]
*  drugs because we've already paid for it with our subsidies. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=161.76s)]
*  I'll be going to the hospital. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=168.88s)]
*  Okay, you know, Dana, I'll start with you since you were press secretary. Yeah. Over a thousand, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  I think in 39 now, questions answered and what I thought was most interesting and I'm curious [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=178.56s)]
*  as to what you thought, bringing in Elon Musk into this first cabinet meeting, the earliest [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=184.96s)]
*  apparently in decades, to literally answer questions, not just to the cabinet, but to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=190.72s)]
*  the American people. Yeah, I mean, when I love cabinet meetings, I used to complain a lot that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Biden never had any, then I realized why he didn't have any because then we at towards the end of his [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=202.72s)]
*  administration, we found out that if he wanted to talk to the Secretary of Treasury about inflation, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  he had to have a scripted talking points. And so you really can't do that in front of the cameras. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=212.72s)]
*  Depending on what issue is happening, you might have somebody in the cabinet or a staff member [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=218.4s)]
*  or somebody, an expert, perhaps somebody from the CIA, in this case, tech support, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=222.72s)]
*  Elon Musk be able to answer questions to anybody in the cabinet or present, make sure that everybody [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=226.72s)]
*  is singing from the same song sheet. And that's what a cabinet meeting really is, is to air [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=231.92s)]
*  ideas, grievances, problems, get on the same page. This is their first one. A team meeting is not a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=236.32s)]
*  bad thing, but the thing that President Trump does is he invites everyone to see it as well. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=242.32s)]
*  So they might have had additional meetings behind the scenes because there are something there are [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=246.88s)]
*  some things you might say not say in front of the press. I don't understand what's happening with [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=250.48s)]
*  the curtains in the cabinet room. That really kind of threw me off because it's such a pretty room. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=256.24s)]
*  Maybe the lighting was bad and it was really sunny today in D.C. or something like that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=261.44s)]
*  But the fact that the president has answered 1039 questions, which by the time I say these words, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=265.84s)]
*  it might be 1050, just shows you how different the previous administration was. They didn't [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=271.36s)]
*  talk to you about anything. And actually, if you go back and watch Karin Jean-Pierre's briefings, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=279.2s)]
*  she actually never really answered a question. She would always say, I can't comment on that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=283.6s)]
*  I've already been very clear. We're not going to talk about that. That's an insulting question. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=287.76s)]
*  They never answering the question. That's not what you're getting here. They might not like the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=292.48s)]
*  answers, but at least they're getting to ask the questions. You know, Jesse, I thought it was [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  fascinating when the president started talking about Zelensky and the mineral deal. And when he [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=300.8s)]
*  talked about the fact that 300 million dollars, 300 billion dollars that we gave to Ukraine and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=306.24s)]
*  Zelensky, whereas Europe only gave 100 billion dollars, but the money that Europe gave to Ukraine, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=312.64s)]
*  they gave us a loan, which meant Ukraine had to pay him back. The money, the 300 billion that Biden [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=319.76s)]
*  gave was not a loan. He just gave him the money like a fool. And now what we've got is a president [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=326.08s)]
*  who says, we're going to get our money back. And from now on, we're not going to be footing the bill [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=331.44s)]
*  for a country that is paying other people back, but not us. Yeah, we're ending wars and we're [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  getting hostages and cash back. That's a first. And you remember he said during the Iraq War, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=341.52s)]
*  we should have cut a deal to get some oil. And that's something that really helped him during [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=347.28s)]
*  the Republican primary when he ran in 2016. I think a lot of Americans agree that with this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=351.84s)]
*  economy the way it is, you need a little something something on the back end. You know, Joe Biden, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=357.28s)]
*  his cabinet meetings, Jill ran them. Right. And people are upset that Musk is in this meeting. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=364.08s)]
*  Dr. Jill was heading up cabinet meetings. He didn't have a cabinet meeting for a year. And like Dana [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=370.32s)]
*  said, it wasn't a cabinet meeting. It was a movie shoot. You were getting questions ahead of time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=375.52s)]
*  The president's going to call on you at 21 minutes into the meeting. What are you going to say? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=381.84s)]
*  It was pretty bad. Now, I'm grateful if I was one of these cabinet secretaries that Musk is in there [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=387.2s)]
*  because it's like good cop, bad cop. He's doing all the firing. He's doing all the spending cuts. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=394.0s)]
*  He's like the bad guy. You don't have to do anything. You know, like I wanted to keep you around, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=400.24s)]
*  but Musk said you had to go. I'm just I'm sorry. And it works. And he doesn't mind taking the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=404.8s)]
*  slings and arrows. And that's good. Somebody has to smashing mugs for attention. Even Greg doesn't [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=410.4s)]
*  go that far. He's daring me. The bears. Would you smash that one in particular? I could not do that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=417.44s)]
*  to my poop mug. Yeah. The bears. The bears. So when you go camping in a national park, judge, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=424.88s)]
*  the first thing you do is you go to the park ranger and ask, should I feed the bears? No. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  I did a little research on bear attacks and fatalities in North America. During the pandemic, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=438.32s)]
*  we shut down the national parks and we didn't have a single park ranger. How many people died from [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=444.24s)]
*  bear attacks that year when there were zero park rangers? One American. When we rehired all of the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=450.48s)]
*  park rangers the next year, 4,000 park rangers. You know how many bear attacks? One. The amount of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=457.68s)]
*  park rangers has nothing to do with how many people's lives they save from bear attacks. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=464.48s)]
*  It is ridiculous. Thank you for that. You're welcome. Greg, what do you want to say about the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=470.72s)]
*  bears? I am pro bear. There's a nice little bar downtown. I'm going to take you guys there. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=476.56s)]
*  I'm done with the transparency. You know, he can retire that jersey. The transparency. He won it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  There's no going back. It's now about spontaneity. You brought it up. In order for the Democrats to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  succeed, they needed a script. They have to film the movie. But what you're seeing right now is [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  an environment where you really can't lie. You can say maybe this or maybe that. Shoot the ball. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=503.6s)]
*  We could probably do this. Maybe we'll do that. I don't know. But as for a cover-up or a fraud, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=509.44000000000005s)]
*  that's impossible to do. You cannot lie on the fly. Believe me, I've tried. But you know, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=514.32s)]
*  I noticed that the change in political action mirrors the change in the internet when it comes [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=522.24s)]
*  to information. It's so much faster. You can't control anything. You can't keep up. And it made [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=529.44s)]
*  me realize that Joe Biden really was dial-up. You know? He was slow, agonizing, undependable, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=535.6s)]
*  prone to failure, makes a funny noise when you turn it on. That was Biden. Trump is basically, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=542.72s)]
*  we now have high-speed fiber internet. And we're like, oh, ouch, slow this thing down. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=548.88s)]
*  As for the critics, this freakout reminds me of another area where we moved from non-transparency [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=555.84s)]
*  to transparency, our voting system. The reaction was hysterical and hyperbolic. And it was all [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  about one thing, voter ID. And it made you wonder, like, what are they trying to hide, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=572.08s)]
*  the meltdown over voter ID? What are they actually trying to hide? Because when you think about it [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=577.6s)]
*  now, we're back in this era of common sense. How absurd was it that they were making an argument [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=582.32s)]
*  against voter ID? The media and the Democrats couldn't find one voter who didn't have an ID. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=589.2s)]
*  So you'd ask them, do you have evidence that this is, like, discriminatory? And they could not find [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=596.72s)]
*  it. It didn't exist. So now we're in this world where we are picking out absurdities and destroying [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=601.76s)]
*  them. Men and women's sports, a porous border. We've got to go after the voting system. We've [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=608.64s)]
*  got to fix this stuff. We've got to put voter ID in. Because we were bamboozled with load-bearing [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=614.32s)]
*  phrases like racism or discrimination. It was all just falling, just like this. Doge. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=620.24s)]
*  You know, you have to admit, Harold, that it was incredible watching the president in his first [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=626.72s)]
*  cabinet meeting. And everyone was there. Elon was there to say what he was doing, to answer questions, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=634.8s)]
*  the cabinet member, the agency heads. I mean, the transparency is really stunning compared to what [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=641.76s)]
*  we have seen. And Trump said, I'm accountable. Buck stops with me. I think that the country, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=648.64s)]
*  I listened to our network earlier, and it was, I think maybe Ari Fleischer was on and was saying [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=654.96s)]
*  that you have to admire the fact the president's come before the country and his cabinet's coming [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=659.28s)]
*  before the country. We had a little of this in the binary, but not enough. But look, I'm done with [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=664.48s)]
*  Joe Biden. And I hope somewhere around the table, I hope everybody can be done with him after a while. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=669.28s)]
*  We now have a new president who not only has answered a lot of questions, he does two press [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=673.6s)]
*  conferences a day. So that kind of transparency and access, I think people have to be excited [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=679.52s)]
*  about. And I think we understand the excitement in the air because of what we saw today. Even Elon [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=684.72s)]
*  Musk being there, I still wish he'd put a shirt and tie on, not wear a t-shirt. But him being there [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=689.36s)]
*  and answering questions. It was quite obvious to me also that some of the cabinet members weren't [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=693.6s)]
*  altogether too crazy about him. But that's another conversation. I think at the end of the day... [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  You mean you could tell by looking at them? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=701.6s)]
*  Well, there was a time... I watched the whole thing. The president made a little comment and [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=703.36s)]
*  you could tell from some of the reaction. But look, Elon being there and answering the questions, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  something you didn't see over the last four years. I don't disagree with your proposition. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=710.72s)]
*  But here's where I think we have to be candid also. This is the first month or two. I mean, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  it's amazing. It feels like it's been eight months. It's been less than two months. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=720.0s)]
*  And President Trump last night enjoyed a great victory in the House. The Congress passed the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=723.6s)]
*  blueprint for the budget. One of the challenges with that is that that budget blueprint they [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=728.16s)]
*  passed did not have encapsulated in it consideration for the no taxes on tips or overtime, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=734.0s)]
*  which I know the president campaign on and which I support and I hope he's able to get. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=739.68s)]
*  The president's talk on tariffs, whether we like it or not, has unsettled things in terms of prices [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=744.88s)]
*  not going down. If we are having this conversation, and we will be about President Trump [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=750.24s)]
*  six months from now and prices are not going down, I would remind that today the Department [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  of Agriculture, the president's own Department of Agriculture, suggested that prices on eggs would [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=759.84s)]
*  go up somewhere between 30 to 40 percent this year alone. That ground beef and sirloin prices [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=763.5200000000001s)]
*  would go up 10 percent. The prices on cars and washing machine and dryers, that wasn't from Ag, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=768.72s)]
*  but from another agency, that they would go up. So I hope they don't. And I hope that the president [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=773.36s)]
*  understands, and today is a good indication he's coming before the country. I hope he continues to [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=778.08s)]
*  come before us. And I hope he continues to answer questions about how do you lower these [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=782.24s)]
*  prices? Because at the end of the day, Judge, that's why he won. Working class people said, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=787.28s)]
*  we don't believe Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have a plan. We believe that Donald Trump does. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=791.84s)]
*  Or we just don't believe Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, period. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=796.16s)]
*  Thank you for that, Harold. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=801.6s)]
*  That might be true, but they elected Donald Trump, so at some point he's going to have to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=802.4s)]
*  answer these questions. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=807.44s)]
*  Well, I think he's doing a great job so far. Up next, Greasy Goes the Joe Rogan Route. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=808.24s)]
*  Gavin Newsom is launching a podcast. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7yKApjDw8&t=813.52s)]
