# Jesse Watters: Federal workers might be getting 'DOGE'd'
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec)
*  What did you do last week? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=0.0s)]
*  If you work for the federal government and you can't answer that by midnight, you might [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=2.12s)]
*  be getting doged. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=5.68s)]
*  This weekend, every D.C. bureaucrat got this message in their inbox. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Please reply to this email with five bullets of what you accomplished last week with a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  deadline. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=17.2s)]
*  And if you don't answer, that's kind of your answer. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  I thought it was great because we have people that don't show up to work and nobody even [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=22.52s)]
*  knows if they work for the government. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  So by asking the question, tell us what you did this week, what he's doing is saying, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=28.8s)]
*  are you actually working? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=33.32s)]
*  And then if you don't answer, like you're sort of semi-fired or you're fired, because [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=35.24s)]
*  a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=40.92s)]
*  I can tell you what I did last week. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=45.24s)]
*  Worked on a federal holiday, plugged Dana's new book, pushed Doge dividend checks, you're [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Jessica on the five politely and sold some Fox merch. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=54.64s)]
*  Cha-ching. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=59.56s)]
*  Now, I came up with that in five minutes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=60.56s)]
*  If I had 48 hours like those federal workers do, it would have been even better. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=63.72s)]
*  But when I was putting together the list, I was inspired. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=68.52s)]
*  And now I've asked the entire primetime team to send me their five bullet points on what [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=72.36s)]
*  they accomplished last week and the deadlines at 6 a.m. tomorrow. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=75.88s)]
*  And we're going to send you and show you what their bullet points are tomorrow. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  And I'll let you know if I fired anybody. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=84.4s)]
*  Nobody on my team was angry when I sent the email, but for some reason, federal workers [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=86.68s)]
*  are. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  Tell us about this email and what it was like receiving it and what you all have talked [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=93.56s)]
*  about after getting it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=99.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=101.56s)]
*  I got this email Saturday afternoon about 3 p.m. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=103.12s)]
*  And I felt absolutely infuriated getting this email with a demand within 48 hours to provide [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=107.88s)]
*  a response and what I did within the last week or face termination. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=116.08s)]
*  This is clearly an attempt from Elon Musk to harass and bully and intimidate the federal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=122.48s)]
*  workforce. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=128.88s)]
*  Putting together a list of accomplishments was maybe the most work some of these bureaucrats [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=131.24s)]
*  did all year. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=135.28s)]
*  If it's that hard for you to name five things you've accomplished in a week, that should [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  tell you something. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=140.8s)]
*  And if it makes you mad or infuriated that you're being asked, that should also tell [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=142.4s)]
*  you something. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=147.76s)]
*  It tells me a lot of these federal workers don't want to justify their jobs because they [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=148.76s)]
*  feel they're entitled. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=152.4s)]
*  And that's a bad attitude. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  And that attitude is about to change. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=156.28s)]
*  Was it just me or did that worker sound like she was reading from a script? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=159.4s)]
*  I think I saw her eyes moving back and forth. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=162.6s)]
*  And what, has this woman never had a review? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=166.68s)]
*  If the answer is no, then that's a huge problem. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=169.84s)]
*  People are getting laid off. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=173.56s)]
*  Tell me why you should stay. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=175.32s)]
*  If the CEO of Bank of America asks me, Jesse, what did you accomplish last week? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=177.8s)]
*  I don't run to CNN and cry and tell the anchor I'm mad. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=183.58s)]
*  If I've been doing a good job, I'm psyched for the opportunity to present my boss with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=188.5s)]
*  a list of my amazing accomplishments so I can get a raise and a promotion and keep helping [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=193.22s)]
*  the company. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=198.02s)]
*  You either have a winning attitude or the attitude of a loser. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=199.8s)]
*  The winner loves the email. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=204.82s)]
*  The loser is whiny. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=206.82s)]
*  This nonsensical email from, from Elon Musk, acting like we're in kindergarten. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  The new Trump administration is reveling in its bare knuckle approach to governing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=217.7s)]
*  This is so sloppy with the way Elon Musk is handling this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=224.89999999999998s)]
*  Why is the media treating these workers like the CEO's spoiled brat son? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=230.14s)]
*  You know, who comes and goes as he pleases, drinks at lunch and harasses the secretaries? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=235.06s)]
*  He's untouchable. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=239.7s)]
*  We all know the guy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=241.1s)]
*  The media is treating the federal workforce like they're untouchable. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=242.82s)]
*  Oh, you can't make them come to the office. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=246.34s)]
*  You can't fire them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  You definitely can't log into their computers and you can't email them on a weekend. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=250.1s)]
*  These are public servants. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=255.32s)]
*  They're supposed to serve the public. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=257.62s)]
*  When we ask, how are you serving us? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=260.32s)]
*  That's an issue. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=263.42s)]
*  Maybe it's because they're not serving us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=265.06s)]
*  They're serving themselves. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=267.2s)]
*  Journalist Chris Ruffo just uncovered a deep state sex chat at the National Security Agency. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=269.26s)]
*  Chat logs show intel officials were using a chat room to share their fetishes and kinks [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  and brag about getting sex changes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=282.86s)]
*  And it goes back two years. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=285.74s)]
*  A transgender sex chat while they were on the clock. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=288.78s)]
*  When you think about it, this was a taxpayer funded transgender sex chat. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=293.42s)]
*  Here's a taste. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=297.66s)]
*  Viewer warning. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=298.86s)]
*  This one guy had just said his manhood surgically removed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=301.22s)]
*  One of the weirdest things that gives me euphoria is when I pee. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=305.42s)]
*  I don't have to push anything down to make sure it aims right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=309.26000000000005s)]
*  Here's another. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  Getting my blank zapped by a laser was shocking. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=315.92s)]
*  Fine, I'll just do one more. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=319.82000000000005s)]
*  This one guy is talking about how excited he is that the bulge is gone and he can wear [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=323.94s)]
*  bikinis after his sex change surgeries. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=329.5s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=331.9s)]
*  And these are intel officials. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=333.14s)]
*  These people are in charge of guarding the nation's deepest secrets and spying on our [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=335.74s)]
*  enemies. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=339.54s)]
*  How mentally tough are these people if they're having doctors chop off their body parts and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=340.98s)]
*  then celebrating it on a work computer? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=345.5s)]
*  Do you know how easy it is to blackmail somebody like that? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=348.5s)]
*  Do you know how China or Russia or the Iranians, what they would do if they got their hands [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  on this? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=357.7s)]
*  First they'd laugh, but then they'd compromise every single one of these reckless agents. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=359.26s)]
*  Elon asked, what did you accomplish at work last week? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  I sexted with my colleagues about pouring hot wax on my nipples. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=369.22s)]
*  This is what happens when 96% of the federal workforce works from home. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=374.14s)]
*  They're having sex change surgeries while they're working from home. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  And their bosses don't even know about it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=382.14s)]
*  I bet we paid for those sex change surgeries. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=384.26s)]
*  And then they're all in the group chat all day. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=387.78s)]
*  Hey, how was your operation? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=390.14s)]
*  Mine was great. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=392.38s)]
*  Still a little sore, but now I can live my own truth. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=393.38s)]
*  If you don't report to work, you know, that's another scam. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=397.05999999999995s)]
*  You know, who the hell, if I'm staying home, I'm going to, let's see, my golf handicap [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=402.73999999999995s)]
*  would get down to very low number. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=407.9s)]
*  I'd be shocked if I told you the real number, but I would be so good, I'd try and get on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=411.66s)]
*  tour. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=416.02000000000004s)]
*  I would be so good. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=418.14000000000004s)]
*  I'd call up, I'd say, listen, I'm really working here. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=420.26000000000005s)]
*  Where are my clubs? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=423.38000000000005s)]
*  Where are my clubs? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=424.38000000000005s)]
*  The Senate's even being put to work. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=426.62s)]
*  Majority Leader Thune is making senators work late into the night. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=428.94000000000005s)]
*  And ready? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=432.62s)]
*  They're working on Fridays now. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=433.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=435.70000000000005s)]
*  And no surprise, senators are already complaining. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=436.70000000000005s)]
*  They want to go home. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=439.14000000000004s)]
*  Democrat Senator Mark Kelly, also a pilot, says he used to run a plane and fly himself [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=440.94s)]
*  home every Friday. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=445.7s)]
*  Alas, he's barely flown on that plane this year. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=447.46s)]
*  He says, unless I want to do it on the weekend, and that's if I get back on the weekend. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=451.46s)]
*  We're $36 trillion in debt because of guys like that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=456.5s)]
*  And they're complaining they have to work on a Friday, not even a summer Friday, a Friday [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=460.97999999999996s)]
*  in February. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=465.09999999999997s)]
*  USAID has been emptied out. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=466.09999999999997s)]
*  2,000 workers were just fired. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=469.34s)]
*  Should have taken the buyout while you had the chance. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=471.46s)]
*  It does make sense, though. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=473.97999999999996s)]
*  They didn't want to leave because the gravy train was just too thick and tasty. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=475.53999999999996s)]
*  For Haiti alone, USAID doled out $2 billion in contracts. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=481.14s)]
*  Guess how much of that money actually went to Haiti? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=486.73999999999995s)]
*  2%. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=490.41999999999996s)]
*  Only 2% of the $2 billion went to where it was supposed to. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=492.14s)]
*  Half of it went to all of these aid groups based around D.C. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=496.9s)]
*  You know, you can't give it to Haiti directly. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=500.41999999999996s)]
*  They just steal the money. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=502.97999999999996s)]
*  So we're going to give it to all of our liberal friends who won't steal the money, and then [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=504.5s)]
*  they'll give it to Haiti. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=509.21999999999997s)]
*  But they didn't. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=511.26s)]
*  Are liberals just stealing from poor black people and calling it compassion? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=513.14s)]
*  A New York Post report says the Red Cross raised $500 million for Haiti. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=518.3s)]
*  And that money was supposed to build homes for 130,000 people. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=523.9s)]
*  They built six. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=529.18s)]
*  $500 million to build six homes in Haiti, where home is not really Mar-a-Lago. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=530.9399999999999s)]
*  And here's a juicy one for you. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=537.8199999999999s)]
*  Meet Latresha Adams. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=539.78s)]
*  She was an advisor to the Biden White House. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=541.9s)]
*  How she got that job, I have no idea. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=543.78s)]
*  The Free Beacon reports that while she was working as a White House advisor, our friend [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=545.86s)]
*  applied for a contract, and not just any contract, a $20 million contract. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=551.86s)]
*  This $20 million contract was for environmental justice. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=557.34s)]
*  And right before Biden leaves office, he gives this $20 million contract to Latresha, her [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=562.1s)]
*  group Young, Gifted, and Green got the $20 million, more like Young, Grifted, and Green. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=567.46s)]
*  Does Latresha have any background in environmental science? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=573.74s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  10 years ago, Latresha was a high school Spanish teacher. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=578.6999999999999s)]
*  She has a bachelor's in Spanish. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=582.3s)]
*  She's based in Memphis, Tennessee, not the greenest city. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=585.3399999999999s)]
*  And you know what Biden does? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  Biden audits Pete Hegseth. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=591.3s)]
*  This lady, Latresha, screaming for an audit. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=593.5799999999999s)]
*  We used to prosecute graft at the Department of Justice. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=597.5799999999999s)]
*  I guess we don't anymore. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=600.18s)]
*  Latresha can just walk out of the White House with $20 million. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=602.5799999999999s)]
*  What did Latresha do with the $20 million? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=606.18s)]
*  Well, we went to their website. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=607.74s)]
*  The only thing they did last year was the Black Maternal and Environmental Health Day. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=609.6600000000001s)]
*  They started a holiday. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=616.1400000000001s)]
*  It's April 4th. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=618.22s)]
*  These people look really legit. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=620.46s)]
*  This is exactly why Trump wants to go visit Fort Knox. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=623.7800000000001s)]
*  We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far, and we've just started. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=628.4200000000001s)]
*  We're actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=635.38s)]
*  stole the gold, tons of gold. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=639.38s)]
*  Finding ways fraud and abuse isn't even that hard. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=642.54s)]
*  You can save money with a stroke of a pen. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=644.82s)]
*  ODNI itself is a pretty small organization compared to most other elements, but even [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=648.3s)]
*  in that small organization, getting rid of DEI saved American taxpayers roughly $20 [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=654.86s)]
*  million, literally with the stroke of President Trump's pen. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=660.78s)]
*  Not even Nancy Pelosi's doge proof. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=664.3s)]
*  According to reports, Trump's looking to sell off the 18-story Nancy Pelosi Federal Building [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=666.9399999999999s)]
*  in San Francisco. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=671.64s)]
*  The building's empty because HHS told its employees not to work there anymore because [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=673.42s)]
*  it's too dangerous. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=677.8199999999999s)]
*  Pelosi's building's surrounded by homeless needles and prostitutes. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=679.9s)]
*  It's about time America had a house cleaning. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=683.98s)]
*  The fraudsters, liars, cheaters, globalists, and deep state bureaucrats are being sent [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=687.38s)]
*  packing. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=693.24s)]
*  The illegal alien criminals are being sent home. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=695.1s)]
*  We're draining the swamp and we're restoring government by the people, for the people. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNclzZaQ1ec&t=698.82s)]
