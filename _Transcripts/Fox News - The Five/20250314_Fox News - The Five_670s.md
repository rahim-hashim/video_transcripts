# 'The Five': Trump ‘cannibalized’ all of Democrats' good issues
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo)
*  Well, the Senate is voting right now on a bill to avoid a government shutdown. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=0.0s)]
*  It appears to be on track to pass after they got 10 Democrats on board, but it didn't come [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=7.2s)]
*  easy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  House Democrats are having a complete meltdown at Chuck Schumer after he folded on a government [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  shutdown. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  There are reports of members screaming at him and threatening a primary. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  Even Nancy Pelosi was calling on Democratic senators to defy Schumer. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=23.44s)]
*  NAOC is ready to throw down and Hakeem Jeffries is leaving Chuck high and dry. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=27.72s)]
*  I believe that's a tremendous mistake. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=33.92s)]
*  It is almost unthinkable why Senate Democrats would vote to to hand the few pieces of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  leverage that we have away for free when we've been sent here to protect Social Security, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=44.68s)]
*  protect Medicaid and protect Medicare. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Is it time for new leadership in the Senate? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=51.76s)]
*  Next question. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  And the party that once demanded Evie mandates is now proudly dumping their electric cars. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=56.24s)]
*  Senator Mark Kelly posted this dopey social media video. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=62.04s)]
*  Here in Washington, driving to work for the last time in my Tesla. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=66.52s)]
*  What matters is, you know, doing the right thing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=71.04s)]
*  I think it's time to get rid of it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=73.68s)]
*  You know, Elon Musk kind of turned out to be an a**. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=75.16s)]
*  And I don't want to be driving the car built and designed by an a**. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=78.8s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for that information. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  And perhaps the most deranged Democrat of them all, Mad Maxine Waters, is accusing President [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=87.64s)]
*  Trump of seeking to start a civil war. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  This president is putting us in a position where hungry people are going to be on the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  street, where nonprofits who were waiting for their checks are not going to get them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=102.16s)]
*  Where seniors waiting for their Social Security check will not get it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  And that happens. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=112.56s)]
*  What does Trump expect? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=113.92s)]
*  Oh, I believe he expects violence. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=115.56s)]
*  I believe he expects confrontation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=118.16s)]
*  I believe he's working toward a civil war. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=120.84s)]
*  Wow, Charlie, so many things to talk about here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  But Chuck Schumer, two days ago, basically had Democrats walk the plank. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=128.2s)]
*  And then last night he soldered off. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=131.8s)]
*  And here we are today now with a win for Donald Trump and Democrats completely in disarray. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=133.96s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything like this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=139.72s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=141.16s)]
*  And I was trying to think about it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=142.68s)]
*  I think the last time I saw Democrats in this much disarray was probably in 2004 after John [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=144.04s)]
*  Kerry lost to George W. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=151.08s)]
*  Bush. And that was even that wasn't even as bad as this time, because, of course, George W. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=152.48s)]
*  Bush was running as an incumbent. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=157.8s)]
*  And so we had sort of the power of the incumbent. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=159.04s)]
*  They are completely lost. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=161.12s)]
*  And it's so much worse because they've lost because Donald Trump has cannibalized all of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=162.68s)]
*  their good issues. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=169.88s)]
*  He's taken every single good issue they have and taken it away from them so that they're left [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  with this insane situation where they're threatening a government shutdown. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=175.2s)]
*  They are the party of government. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=179.16s)]
*  They're the party of government is the answer to all your problems. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=181.2s)]
*  And we're going to shut it down. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=184.76s)]
*  And then and then, of course, as you point out, he saws the plank off and leaves Democrats [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=186.55999999999997s)]
*  holding the bag. And you have a situation where you have Senate Democrats versus House [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=192.88s)]
*  Democrats. You have leadership Democrats versus other leadership Democrats. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  One other thing I think is kind of interesting is as Nancy Pelosi kind of fades into the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=200.32s)]
*  background, I swear, you know, I know Republicans tend to not like her, but she was so [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=204.28s)]
*  gifted at keeping Democrats together. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=210.16s)]
*  Yeah. And we are seeing her absence right now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=212.68s)]
*  And but she's also president because, Judge, she's saying that Schumer needs to go and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=214.64s)]
*  that the Senate leadership has completely failed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=218.8s)]
*  I find it so interesting that you have Hakeem Jeffries, who lives down the street from [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=221.32s)]
*  Chuck Schumer in Brooklyn. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=225.84s)]
*  That's a little awkward. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=227.36s)]
*  Neighbors is not being the one who said who should primary him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=228.44s)]
*  It's AOC. Also, got the street. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=231.44s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's interesting that AOC just kind of as an aside before I get into it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  with the, you know, the division between the House Dems and the Senate Dems. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=238.76s)]
*  But AOC is doing some interesting things. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=242.88s)]
*  I think that whether or not Hakeem Jeffries wants to admit it, I mean, they're furious [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=245.52s)]
*  with Schumer's. You know, if you think about it, I mean, he's the one with the Corona [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=250.16s)]
*  beer and he was at all the Doge protests and the avocados and he was singing and he [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=253.68s)]
*  was doing the videos. Now, all of a sudden, he did a U-turn. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=259.56s)]
*  Honestly, I think it was a smart move. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=262.6s)]
*  I don't think the Democrats realized that because they would have given Donald Trump [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=265.48s)]
*  power to decide, you know, who gets paid, what's considered an essential job. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=269.16s)]
*  And so Donald Trump would say, you people are not essential, so you're not going to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=276.44s)]
*  get paid. I mean, Schumer was between a rock and a hard place. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=279.76s)]
*  And he made the decision not to shut the government down. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=283.36s)]
*  But we all know that the party in power is the one that suffers when the government is [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=285.4s)]
*  shut down. But I want to go to AOC. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=290.08s)]
*  Now, AOC is doing what Gavin Newsom is doing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=292.28s)]
*  She said that she's going to start going into the red districts and town halls and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=297.24s)]
*  she's going to go out there with Bernie Sanders. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=302.44s)]
*  She and I think the time for her is now or never. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=305.2s)]
*  I think she is making a decision that, you know what? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=308.24s)]
*  I think that this is the time for me to get out there because Schumer is out of sync [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=312.56s)]
*  with us. And if there's anything that she has done in the last few years since she's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=317.36s)]
*  come to Congress, she's become more thoughtful and she's become more reasoned and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  she makes it clear what it is that she's thinking. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=328.0s)]
*  So they've got a real divide within the party. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  And I think that she is the one who might be able to put it all together. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=333.32s)]
*  So, Harold, from a strategy perspective, this was a situation where Democrats initially [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  wanted to shut the government down, saying they could blunt President Trump's agenda. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=342.68s)]
*  Then they realized what the judge just said about Trump actually having more power in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=346.32s)]
*  a shutdown to say, we just need essential workers. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=350.32s)]
*  Now, everybody else is not working. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=353.0s)]
*  Doge can say, why are they employed by the federal government at all? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=354.36s)]
*  So now they're in this position where they're voting for the CR. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=358.2s)]
*  But it's actually a Biden level spending CR. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's not like they're really losing that much. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  And now you have this infighting within the party. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=366.88s)]
*  And AOC, who is admittedly far left, is the one who's getting the credit for being [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  the one bringing people together. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=373.2s)]
*  Well, good to be here. Happy Friday. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=374.88s)]
*  I think that that's one perspective that you just laid out there, Katie. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think I get the political downfall, as the judge was saying, for Democrats. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=380.32s)]
*  They didn't support this. And the reality is this looks a lot like the spending [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=385.52s)]
*  numbers from last year. But when you're out of ideas, it seems like my party is, you [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=388.92s)]
*  seem to kind of be out of focus. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=394.84s)]
*  And as a result, you see these kinds of machinations. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=397.76s)]
*  We should not forget a week ago, there was a back and forth between Republicans in [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  the House about what this bill should look like and whether or not they could bring [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=404.56s)]
*  all of their party together. So this consternation around this bill has been [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=409.08s)]
*  bipartisan to Chuck Schoen was probably going to face a face a primary challenge [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=412.88s)]
*  from one of the names that you one of the names mentioned, including the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  congresswoman from Congresswoman AOC or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=421.2s)]
*  And she will be a formidable opponent, because I think what Mr. Schumer doesn't [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=427.08s)]
*  probably didn't calculate right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=431.36s)]
*  No one knows what he was standing for here. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=433.24s)]
*  If he if he just decide I'm going to flip, you've got to have a reason. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=435.2s)]
*  I've always said any politician can change his or her mind. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  I always accept when someone comes to my side. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  But you're not perceived as being authentic if you don't explain why you made the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=443.4s)]
*  change. I think there were Democrats had wanted some concessions from Republicans. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=447.36s)]
*  Maybe they couldn't have achieved them or couldn't have won them. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=451.04s)]
*  But this may be the worst of all worlds. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=453.72s)]
*  Would it have been great if Chuck Schumer had said, hey, here's what we want. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  Here's what our plan looks like. We're calling for a vote on our budget, which [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=459.76000000000005s)]
*  we have a lift to every American Child Act, which will promote and hire teachers [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  who do a good job, have real, enforceable, accountable academic standards in our [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=467.12s)]
*  schools and provide every kid with a summer job and internship to help foster [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=471.44s)]
*  good work skills and understand what it means to be in the real world. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  Lower taxes on people earning enough, just something that Democrats could have [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=479.0s)]
*  rallied around, even if Republicans didn't allow it to come up for a vote. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=482.88s)]
*  So a lot of ways, I think this may be it's it's I think the government not closing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=487.28s)]
*  You said it well, the end judge, the party in power normally catches the blame on [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=491.44s)]
*  these kinds of things. I don't want government to shut down, but I think the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=495.28s)]
*  country needs to be given an alternative. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=498.04s)]
*  And unfortunately, the only alternative, it seems like Mr. Schumer gave Democrats [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=500.4s)]
*  was the flip flop. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  So, Greg, you know who else lives in New York? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=505.08s)]
*  Who? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=507.08s)]
*  Harold Ford. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=507.84s)]
*  I love that alternative to AOC to run. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=508.84s)]
*  I wish he would run for something, you know, just to get him off this table. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=512.08s)]
*  He's going to run away from you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=515.88s)]
*  You know, the Dems are like, you know, that hurts. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=517.16s)]
*  Democrats are like that kind of lonely, unpopular neighbor that's next to the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=522.68s)]
*  neighbor throwing an amazing kegger. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=528.04s)]
*  And that unpopular neighbor is trying to figure out, do I try to sneak in and join [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=531.8s)]
*  the fun or do I call the cops on them and break up the party? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=536.6s)]
*  They decided to try to sneak in because they know, you know, you don't want to be [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=540.4s)]
*  the person you don't want to be the party that's only known for one thing, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=545.4s)]
*  stopping people from having fun. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=549.08s)]
*  It's like a heckler at a comedy club. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=551.4s)]
*  The heckler is hated not just by the comedian, but by the entire crowd, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=553.6s)]
*  especially if the comedian is good. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=558.28s)]
*  They want you thrown out of there. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=560.6s)]
*  Plus, I mean, think about shutting down the government. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=562.76s)]
*  If you shut down the government, that doesn't shut down Doge, does it? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=564.76s)]
*  It's like you could shut down the government, come back and you're, you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=568.72s)]
*  know, your Che Guevara desk calendar could be gone. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=571.08s)]
*  So maybe you keep the government open so you can make sure that you got an eye on [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=573.96s)]
*  Doge. Mark Kelly is kind of disappointed. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=578.36s)]
*  Disappointing to me. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=581.64s)]
*  He puts the ass in astronaut. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=582.68s)]
*  Here's a guy who spent years guilting us over climate change and then he sells his [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=584.56s)]
*  electric car. And what does he buy? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=590.04s)]
*  A Chevy Tahoe. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=591.96s)]
*  Tahoe is consumed gas like the view consumes pie. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=593.76s)]
*  And it's something something tells me that he planned that he didn't just like, oh, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=597.68s)]
*  I'm selling my my you know, my EV. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=601.56s)]
*  It was planned a long time ago. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=604.6s)]
*  I was exploiting that sale for a virtue signal. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  I do this all the time. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  I'll give a scented candle to catch. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=610.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm so nice. So nice that you thought of me. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=612.56s)]
*  She doesn't know that Dana gave it to me. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, it's just like he just exploited it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=616.1999999999999s)]
*  By the way, if you sell your electric car, it doesn't hurt Musk. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=619.52s)]
*  You already paid for it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=622.64s)]
*  So it doesn't matter. But virtue signaling always supersedes common sense. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=624.16s)]
*  If Trump came out against assault, you know, leftists would punch themselves in the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=629.68s)]
*  face. And just lastly, not enough has been said about the violence directed at these [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=634.16s)]
*  Tesla dealerships and how they relate to the stock drop, because why would somebody [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  buy something that puts a target on their back? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=645.2399999999999s)]
*  So it's it's mob pressure that is used to kill demand. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=648.3599999999999s)]
*  It's social extortion. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=652.28s)]
*  That's not nothing else. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=654.1999999999999s)]
*  And Tesla, in a way, has become like a MAGA hat that gives you an excuse to throw [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  something at it. You know, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3p65SviByo&t=659.92s)]
