# Judge Jeanine: These hostages are coming out of hell
**Fox News - The Five:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU)
*  Let's turn to the other breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a big story. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=1.7s)]
*  The hostage breakthrough in Israel. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=2.94s)]
*  The Jewish state and Hamas agreeing to a four day pause [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  in the fighting in a deal that would free at least 50 women [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=8.06s)]
*  and children held captive by the Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=11.5s)]
*  The deal was negotiated by Qatar with help [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=14.3s)]
*  from the US and Egypt. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=16.82s)]
*  Israel's prime minister says he's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=18.82s)]
*  happy to get the hostages out, but says [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=20.38s)]
*  it will not stop Israel from destroying Hamas. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=22.02s)]
*  The war is continuing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=26.26s)]
*  We continue to continue the war until we [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=28.0s)]
*  obtain or reach all our goals, bring all our objectives back, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=30.44s)]
*  destroy Hamas, and have assurance that no terrorist, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=34.16s)]
*  no terror body will be in charge of Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=41.2s)]
*  Gaza will no longer be a threat for Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=46.2s)]
*  We are winning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  And we will continue fighting until the absolute complete [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=49.92s)]
*  victory. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=53.92s)]
*  And we're doing this thanks to the bravery of our fighters [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=55.540000000000006s)]
*  and our sons and daughters, the heroes of Israel, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=60.540000000000006s)]
*  and their sacrifices. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=64.3s)]
*  A lot of different angles to this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=66.74000000000001s)]
*  Joey, let me start with you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=68.58s)]
*  So Hamas is saying, it will say, it [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=70.14s)]
*  is because we are so strong and Israel so weak [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=74.18s)]
*  that we brought Israel to this point. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=77.06s)]
*  Israel's point of view is that it's their military actions that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=79.46000000000001s)]
*  have brought Hamas to this point. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=82.5s)]
*  And regardless, also Israel says, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=84.88s)]
*  don't think that we are going to do a permanent ceasefire. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=86.8s)]
*  Their goal to destroy Hamas ultimately [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=89.2s)]
*  is still going to happen, according [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=91.84s)]
*  to what they're saying. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=94.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess this is why they have hostages [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=95.84s)]
*  to begin with. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=97.96s)]
*  I mean, they knew that they were outgunned, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=98.76s)]
*  and they were probably outmanned, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  and in Gaza alone, they were going [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=102.48s)]
*  to be under siege in some way. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=105.76s)]
*  I think that what strikes me about this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=108.4s)]
*  is that on October 7th, Americans were murdered. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=110.56s)]
*  We have Americans held hostage. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=113.74s)]
*  There have been 66 attacks, direct attacks, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=115.06s)]
*  on Americans in the Middle East. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=117.86s)]
*  And I believe 62 Americans injured. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=119.34s)]
*  We have Americans stationed in the Mediterranean. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=122.3s)]
*  We're at war, whether we want to say that or not. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=125.5s)]
*  We are in this war, and I'm not advocating for us [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=128.06s)]
*  to take any steps of war. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=130.78s)]
*  But the reality is this is not just Israel and Hamas [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=132.42s)]
*  fighting a war. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=135.74s)]
*  America is a big player, a big actor in this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=136.74s)]
*  So when Joe Biden praises this, and we [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=139.18s)]
*  hear that Qatar and the US helped negotiate it, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=141.92s)]
*  that tells me Joe Biden wanted this, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=144.44s)]
*  and probably put pressure, because when you watch [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=146.32s)]
*  Netanyahu, some of the concessions, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=148.68s)]
*  not to get into the weeds before anybody else has a chance, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=150.12s)]
*  but they're going to stop aerial surveillance [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=152.32s)]
*  in South Gaza for four days, stop aerial surveillance [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  in northern Gaza Strip for pretty much an entire chunk [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=156.76s)]
*  of the day, all of daylight, for four days. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=160.64s)]
*  They're giving up 150 prisoners, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  and the prisoners have done things so much [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=165.2s)]
*  that Israel says, hey, if you're a victim [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=167.26s)]
*  of what these prisoners have done, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=168.98s)]
*  do you have a certain amount of hours, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=170.52s)]
*  something like if it's 24 or 48, to appeal, letting them go. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=171.6s)]
*  So the point here is Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=175.16s)]
*  doesn't want to have to do this to get hostages back, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=177.6s)]
*  because this really is a huge strategic advantage [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=179.9s)]
*  for Hamas that is on the defensive. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=182.4s)]
*  Judge, one of the things that you and I [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=185.64s)]
*  are both reading about today, and I'm sure you all have too, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=187.44s)]
*  but it was something that struck us, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=189.58s)]
*  is the guidance that was given to the IDF, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=192.44s)]
*  the Israeli Defense Forces, for what they are supposed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=195.24s)]
*  to say and do when they come into contact [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=198.74s)]
*  with the children in particular of the hostages [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=201.64s)]
*  that are going to be released. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=204.38s)]
*  Yeah, and it was very, it's very touching, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=205.88s)]
*  and it's very compelling. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=208.52s)]
*  I mean, the guidance is very clear. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=210.02s)]
*  The IDF will be the first to get in touch, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=211.62s)]
*  or to reach the children who are going to be transferred. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=214.16s)]
*  And let me just say one thing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=217.96s)]
*  These children have been in captivity. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=219.06s)]
*  They've been hostages for seven weeks. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=221.74s)]
*  The children who are being released on the other side [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=224.56s)]
*  by Israel are children who were born of mothers [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=228.06s)]
*  who've been convicted of crimes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  So they are raised in a jail with their mothers, okay? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=234.16s)]
*  So they're with someone they're familiar with. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=237.64s)]
*  These children that are going to be released today [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=240.2s)]
*  are coming out of hell. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  And so the guidance is that you don't touch them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=244.88s)]
*  You ask them if they want something to drink. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  You ask them if you can hold their hand, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=250.2s)]
*  if it looks like it's difficult for them to walk. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  There is no question. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=254.76s)]
*  These kids are gonna have PTSD. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=255.6s)]
*  They've gotta be checked for health issues [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=258.36s)]
*  as well as mental health issues going forward. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=261.0s)]
*  They're like the crime victims that I dealt with [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=264.32s)]
*  for so many years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=266.6s)]
*  They're vulnerable. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  They don't feel that they are safe anywhere, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=269.44s)]
*  and they've got a lot of work to do it to get over that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=273.36s)]
*  But these are days of high anxiety, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=276.88s)]
*  and my heart goes out to those families in Israel, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=280.02s)]
*  because we've got 50 for 150 of the Hamas-convicted women. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=283.4s)]
*  And if your family isn't coming home, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=289.64s)]
*  if your wife or your daughter or your grandchild [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=292.7s)]
*  isn't one of them, what Hamas has said is, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=295.96s)]
*  well, maybe you can give us a few more days [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=298.76s)]
*  if we offer to let some other hostages go. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=301.28s)]
*  So they're trying to elongate the whole thing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  But it's clear that Netanyahu is gonna go forward [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=307.82s)]
*  with destroying Hamas. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=311.28s)]
*  This is a temporary lull. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  He didn't even call it a ceasefire. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=314.96s)]
*  Right, but Greg, you can imagine that the people [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  who have been calling for a ceasefire, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=319.52s)]
*  as soon as this pause happens, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=321.52s)]
*  they're gonna press really hard and say, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=323.47999999999996s)]
*  we could just have an immediate ceasefire altogether [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=325.52s)]
*  and stop all the fighting. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=327.67999999999995s)]
*  Their opinion shouldn't matter. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=328.52s)]
*  We have a protest movement in the West [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=329.76s)]
*  that is trying to infect this with identity politics, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  that somehow if a country gets attacked [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  by somebody from a different group, you can't fight back. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=337.44s)]
*  Imagine if you were being mugged by a smaller person. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=341.0s)]
*  You couldn't fight back, because that would be bullying. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=344.24s)]
*  So the fact that in the Israeli conflict [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=346.52s)]
*  and in your own personal safety, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=349.84s)]
*  in this realm of self-defense, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=352.24s)]
*  there should be no identity politics. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=353.68s)]
*  That's why I know that this protest movement [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=355.16s)]
*  means anything to me, because it's all based [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=356.48s)]
*  in historical context rather than what's happening [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=358.04s)]
*  since October 7th. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=361.08s)]
*  But this area, this breakthrough, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=363.24s)]
*  and I hesitate to say anything about it, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=364.9s)]
*  because I don't have skin in the game. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=366.88s)]
*  I don't have relatives that are hostage. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=368.96s)]
*  And if this is good, it's good for Hamas [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=371.28s)]
*  because they get time to regroup [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=375.4s)]
*  and they're torturing these families of hostages [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=377.76s)]
*  as they wrestle with this uncertainty [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=380.68s)]
*  of whether it's gonna be their kids [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=382.4s)]
*  or their mother or whatever. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  But if you say it's bad, I can't say that to families [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=385.84s)]
*  who may get their children back. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=389.47999999999996s)]
*  That's not for me to say. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  So it's like, it's a challenge to figure out what this is [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=391.84s)]
*  because these are two different entities. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=397.4s)]
*  Israel is fighting to save lives. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  Hamas doesn't care about saving lives. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=402.28s)]
*  They're happily put Palestinians in front of guns [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=404.44s)]
*  and become human targets. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=407.67999999999995s)]
*  Their goal is to create the biggest death toll. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=409.32s)]
*  So I almost feel like, like Joey said, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  that this whole hostage-taking thing [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=413.44s)]
*  is built into the equation. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=415.41999999999996s)]
*  They knew this was gonna happen. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=418.12s)]
*  But it raises questions. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=419.76s)]
*  How do you negotiate with monsters? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  Who are you negotiating with [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=424.88s)]
*  and why are they still alive? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=426.2s)]
*  If you can track hostage movements [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=428.4s)]
*  and I guess you know where they're gonna be held, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=430.0s)]
*  why did they get three times as many prisoners [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  if it's about Israel's response? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=435.56s)]
*  Who's holding the cards here, I guess, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=439.44s)]
*  is what I'm getting at. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=441.12s)]
*  And who are we helping by applying pressure? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=442.76s)]
*  Are we helping Israel by convincing them to do things [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  that Netanyahu doesn't wanna do? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=448.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=450.28s)]
*  I do think there was a lot of pressure put on. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=451.52s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  It's extremely complex and complicated. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  And Harold, it's excruciating emotional blackmail. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=458.56s)]
*  And one of the things that's about to happen [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=462.56s)]
*  is family separation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=464.12s)]
*  I thought the left didn't want family separation, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=465.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, we shouldn't want that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=468.44s)]
*  But what's going to happen is you have children [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  who are going to release, perhaps with their mothers, right? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  But their fathers or their brothers or grandfathers [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  or cousins are going to be left behind with Hamas. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=478.68s)]
*  So it's just an excruciating situation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=481.32s)]
*  So as we are naive of Thanksgiving, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=483.8s)]
*  I'm thankful for a lot of things. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=486.12s)]
*  This is one of them. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=487.32s)]
*  This is a messy situation. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=488.16s)]
*  This is what war is. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  I think Joey is right when you say that we are [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=490.92s)]
*  more engaged and embroiled because we have two [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=493.56s)]
*  unbelievable pieces of presence there, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=496.6s)]
*  some of the best real estate and best people [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=498.88s)]
*  that the US military has. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=501.56s)]
*  It is clear that we are more involved. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=504.0s)]
*  I differ with you guys slightly. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=506.72s)]
*  I think for those who are in support of Palestinians [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=508.2s)]
*  and believe in being activists for better Palestinian life, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=512.68s)]
*  this should show that everything that many of us [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=517.48s)]
*  on this panel have been saying and others have been saying [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=519.28s)]
*  that this has really been in the hands of Hamas all along, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=521.52s)]
*  if they had released the hostages, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=524.88s)]
*  if some who are so active and so loud [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=527.12s)]
*  and sometimes can be violent in their activism [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=529.84s)]
*  on behalf of Hamas and the Palestinians, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  if Hamas had released the hostages, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=535.1999999999999s)]
*  it would have been a lot easier for the US [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  and others around the globe to urge Netanyahu [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=540.72s)]
*  not to wage in Israel not to respond [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=542.88s)]
*  as forcefully as they have. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=545.6s)]
*  Two, Netanyahu's made it very clear. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  He's not stopping. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=549.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, there's PR pressure that has mounted [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=551.08s)]
*  over the last several weeks. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=554.1600000000001s)]
*  He has not bowed to it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=555.28s)]
*  He is thankful that 50 Israelis are coming home, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=556.88s)]
*  but he's made clear we want all of the hostages. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=559.72s)]
*  So I don't have any doubt that even though [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=562.0400000000001s)]
*  there will be pressure, as Greg, you and Dana, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=564.36s)]
*  I think rightly point out, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=566.72s)]
*  that Netanyahu has made clear [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  that that is not the direction he's going. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  Finally, even combatants when driven, when pressured, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=573.12s)]
*  be it military pressure or other towards a humane goal, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=577.76s)]
*  even combatants can find their way somehow to it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=580.6s)]
*  So my advice is don't stop what you're doing. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=583.88s)]
*  We are here at this moment [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=587.1600000000001s)]
*  because of the American military presence in that region, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=588.44s)]
*  because of what the Israeli defense forces are doing, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=591.08s)]
*  and frankly, because of the enormous pressure [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=594.4s)]
*  that Israelis, their society is putting on Palestinians [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=600.36s)]
*  and Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=603.76s)]
*  So I hope they don't let up, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  and I'm glad that these hostages are coming home. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  There's just one thing I did wanna say, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=607.12s)]
*  even though it was my turn to ask questions, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  I just wanted to remind everybody [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=610.2s)]
*  that it is very likely that when these hostages are released, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=611.72s)]
*  that they have been given instruction [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=615.04s)]
*  in order to protect the family members who are left behind, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=617.72s)]
*  that they've been given instruction to say, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=620.04s)]
*  I was well taken care of, everything was fine, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=621.9599999999999s)]
*  they were really kind to me, everything was great. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=624.4s)]
*  So remember that, that they're under incredible pressure, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=626.36s)]
*  and don't be fooled by Hamas. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=630.0s)]
*  All right, bye. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Legq5-IiU&t=631.68s)]
