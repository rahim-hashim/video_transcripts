# Transgender activists 'crave chaos': Greg Gutfeld
**Fox News - The Five:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw)
*  The left's delusions of victimhood on full display in Massachusetts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=0.0s)]
*  A city council meeting in the state's second largest city going off the rails [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=3.88s)]
*  after nearly 200 far left agitators started screaming and demanding [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=8.36s)]
*  their town become a sanctuary city for transgender people. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=13.56s)]
*  If you think you're afraid of Trump, you should see how afraid of Trump I am. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=18.92s)]
*  You better prepare for trans people to make this a very unsafe space. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=24.12s)]
*  I don't want to spend an hour applying glitter on my face so that you will hear and see me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=29.04s)]
*  I'm shaking right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=36.28s)]
*  I don't want to be here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=38.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, am I taking too long pleading for my life? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=41.92s)]
*  Please look at me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=44.8s)]
*  OK, well done here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Pathetic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=51.44s)]
*  And the woke pressure campaign worked with the city improving the resolution. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  OK, so Dana, we've got transgender sanctuary cities now where the LGBTQ plus a one [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=58.56s)]
*  and advocacy groups are fearful. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=67.88s)]
*  What are they fearful of? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what bothers me about this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=73.28s)]
*  I feel I don't want anyone to feel scared. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I can kind of look at this and laugh. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=78.4s)]
*  And I did a little bit with the drama of it all. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=80.32s)]
*  But I also think that the far left has made people who are in this situation, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  whether it's mental health or whether they believe it, whatever it is, if they're adults, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=90.68s)]
*  if they're kids, I think some of these people are obviously adults. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  They are being made to be fearful for their lives for no reason. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Right. For politics. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=100.92s)]
*  Nobody is coming after them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=103.12s)]
*  There are going to be some rules and guidelines about bathrooms. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  There's going to be some rules and guidelines about sports and the protection of women's sports. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=109.36s)]
*  There will be rules and guidelines protecting children. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  But when that guy says, I'm pleading for my life, I don't really understand where that comes from. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  Except for that, if he's getting fed information from the left that makes him think that he should be fearful. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=121.84s)]
*  I don't want anyone to have to live like that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the amazing thing or not so amazing is the fact that you've got people like Rachel Maddow [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=129.52s)]
*  and Joy Behar, I mean, saying they're going to lose their jobs. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=136.76s)]
*  The ABC studios are going to be bombed. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=140.32s)]
*  They're going to be off the air. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=142.72s)]
*  But it's such a self-centered concern that has no basis. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=144.16s)]
*  In fact, what are they being protected from? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=150.36s)]
*  They don't look young enough to play high school sports. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=153.88s)]
*  So as far as I'm concerned, I don't know exactly how the Trump administration can do anything. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=157.76s)]
*  You can be trans in America. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=165.48s)]
*  You can dress like that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=167.64s)]
*  You can act like that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=169.52s)]
*  As far as I know, the trans regulations only involve the military and involve sports. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  Everything else they can still do exactly the same. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=183.8s)]
*  I have to say the guy or the girl in the leather jacket was hysterical. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  And I'm not anti-trans. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  Some of these people are great. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  This person is hilarious. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=197.08s)]
*  I want to get to know them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=198.96s)]
*  I would have a drink with that person, man, woman, whatever she is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=200.55999999999997s)]
*  He is. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=204.44s)]
*  But it is kind of funny that the left just got bushwhacked last November. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=205.55999999999997s)]
*  And America was like, we're done with this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=213.88s)]
*  And the Democrats have come out and asked for reparations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=216.48s)]
*  They have trans sanctuary cities now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=219.6s)]
*  And they're basically trying to recapture that late 60s revolutionary spirit, where it's a bunch of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  singing and dancing and swearing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=229.12s)]
*  This is not a civil rights movement. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=232.08s)]
*  This is just we don't want DEI and we want everybody to stick to their bathrooms. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=234.36s)]
*  Once the left gets over that, I think we can get along. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=238.8s)]
*  You know, Harold, apparently there's some talk of they're getting the locals to resist and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=243.16s)]
*  enforcing laws from other states that criminalize health care on gender affirming care. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=249.16s)]
*  But that's for kids. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=256.2s)]
*  So I think that's as I read through this earlier today and reading through it again, that seems to be [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=258.16s)]
*  that the most powerful part of it in terms of resolution, in terms of what this the kind of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=262.8s)]
*  protections that it may give people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  However, it's a non binding. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=269.68s)]
*  It has no legal binding power. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=271.68s)]
*  It's more of a declaration. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=273.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  It sounds like from from the city. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=275.56s)]
*  I agree a lot of things what Jesse just said there about I have no issue with anyone [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=277.64s)]
*  exercising their freedom and exercising their sexual preference. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=284.36s)]
*  I think the issue for a lot of Americans was whether or not men would become women and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=287.8s)]
*  compete against women in sports and go in the bathrooms. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=294.0s)]
*  I think there was a safety of public safety and other concerns. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=296.44s)]
*  Again, I feel terrible that someone feels the way that this person does and had this had to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  share that. And and as crazy as this may sound, I think it might even behoove the president, our [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=305.44s)]
*  president, to say what you just said, which is this is what I was trying to do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=310.6s)]
*  I can differ with your lifestyle, but you had freedom to live your life the way you want to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  live. But what I don't want is for for men to be going into women's bathrooms, the little boys [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=318.20000000000005s)]
*  are going to little girls bathrooms and boys to be playing sports with little girls. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=322.44s)]
*  That's my opposition to it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's unfortunate they had to do this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=327.48s)]
*  But I don't quite understand the amount of time because it's a legally it's not a legally [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=329.44s)]
*  binding resolution. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=333.92s)]
*  What do you think, Greg? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=335.6s)]
*  Oh, Harold, you're acting like this is real. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=336.72s)]
*  This is not real. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  This is no. You hear me out here. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  Imagine that this had nothing to do with sex. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=344.92s)]
*  And it was a group of people maintaining that they want their healthy limbs removed. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=347.44s)]
*  Would you sit there and have the same apply the same kind of logic? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=351.56s)]
*  You know, maybe we should like you don't have to listen to this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=354.76s)]
*  The only fear that you are experiencing is the the city council terrified of them. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=358.68s)]
*  There is no fear among the all of that was performative. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=365.48s)]
*  I'm shaking right now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  That is fake. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=369.76s)]
*  You know what? If they did not even go to this, no one would care. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=371.24s)]
*  They would not know who these people are, but they can't live their lives where there is no [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=376.04s)]
*  attention. They cannot live in obscurity like the rest of us. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=381.4s)]
*  They crave this chaos. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=385.76s)]
*  The idea that somebody is targeting them is what they get off of. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=387.64s)]
*  These people are not trans. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=391.8s)]
*  They are trans activists. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=393.88000000000005s)]
*  They are melodrama queens. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  And the and the council just indulges this to save their own skin. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=398.56s)]
*  And it's kind of sad because a lot. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=403.16s)]
*  The sad part about it is a lot of these people are mentally ill. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  They will not find no joy in life because they're separated from the idea of mental [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=409.24s)]
*  health. The prism that they operate their life in will never lead them to a good place [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  because everything they think is wrong. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=420.92s)]
*  And you indulge them by looking at them as a block of people when in fact they're very [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=423.88s)]
*  troubled. You feed their attention. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=429.08s)]
*  Imagine if they weren't there. We wouldn't even have this segment. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=431.68s)]
*  That would hurt them more if we didn't have this segment. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=435.08s)]
*  I'm glad we had this segment. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=437.76s)]
*  Well, good for you. I want to give them a lot of attention. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=439.08s)]
*  I like Michael Jackson. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=441.0s)]
*  I had our factories just one Democrat is convinced. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jnn5erZOzw&t=442.32s)]
