# 'THE FEAR CARD': 'The Five' reacts to Democrats panicking over deportations
**Fox News - The Five:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q)
*  The party that holds no cards has suddenly found one to play. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=0.0s)]
*  The fear card. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Democrats are now warning that President Trump is going to disappear you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=7.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=11.16s)]
*  Because 47 floated the idea of deporting some of the most twisted violent American criminals, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=12.16s)]
*  think Hannibal Lecter on steroids, and shipping them off to a foreign prison. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=16.96s)]
*  We're getting rid of our criminals from out of the United States that were allowed to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  come in by Biden. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=26.16s)]
*  We're getting them out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=27.4s)]
*  And the president is helping us with that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=29.28s)]
*  President Bukele. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=32.32s)]
*  Could we use it for violent criminals, our own violent criminals? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=33.32s)]
*  I call them homegrown criminals. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=37.16s)]
*  I mean, the homegrown. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=38.64s)]
*  The homegrown. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=39.64s)]
*  The ones that grew up and something went wrong and they hit people over the head with a baseball [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=40.64s)]
*  bat. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=44.68s)]
*  We have and push people into subways just before the train gets there, like you see [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=46.68s)]
*  happening sometimes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=51.44s)]
*  We are looking into it and we want to do it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=53.72s)]
*  I would love to do that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=55.92s)]
*  And now the left's worried that Trump is about to disappear the view. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=57.64s)]
*  We are watching our neighbors, students and friends being fired, targeted and disappeared. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=62.28s)]
*  It is real. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=71.0s)]
*  The Trump administration's claim legally is that they can take anyone in the United States [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=72.04s)]
*  and disappear them to a foreign country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=80.72s)]
*  There is not included in Title 18, send someone out of the country, much less to a hellhole [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=83.32s)]
*  prison in another country. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  What stops Donald Trump from wrongfully labeling any American as a non-citizen gang member [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=90.16s)]
*  and abducting them in the dead of night and rendering them to a foreign prison to be tortured? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=97.32s)]
*  He's going to do that to U.S. citizens. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  I think the hosts of The View are about to get administratively errored. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=106.32s)]
*  Stems in the media also playing the fear card over their so-called Maryland dad, championing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  the return of the alleged MSNB's MS-13 gang banger and designated foreign terrorist, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, after Trump sent the Salvadorian migrant back home to El Salvador. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=122.28s)]
*  Democrat Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen is actually going to fly to El Salvador to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=128.6s)]
*  show his solidarity. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=132.56s)]
*  You've got a Maryland man who's the father of three. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=135.0s)]
*  Illegally detained in a notorious prison in El Salvador. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=141.08s)]
*  It is absolutely unjust and illegal to have this Marylander detained one more day in a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=146.4s)]
*  notorious prison in El Salvador. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Was the senator crying? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=160.96s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  I think his voice was breaking, but I'm not sure. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  It's going through puberty. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=166.36s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=167.36s)]
*  I mean, it happens for, goes for a while. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=168.36s)]
*  Obviously, the rule of law is important. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=170.84s)]
*  I don't know whether the president was joking about homegrown. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=172.72s)]
*  I think it might behoove them to maybe clarify. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=175.4s)]
*  He said it more than once, but it kind of reminds me of the third term talk. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=179.24s)]
*  So I'm not exactly sure. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=182.4s)]
*  But I also know this, that for years we had no system to vet anybody that was just walking [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  across the border into our country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=193.08s)]
*  Not only that, President Biden made up this thing, the CNHV Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  to make a program so that they didn't even have to make an effort to cross the border [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=199.6s)]
*  illegally. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=203.48s)]
*  They could just fly in. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=204.48s)]
*  And now we have to vet all of them to get them out. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=205.96s)]
*  And it seems like this continual problem for the Biden administration that they're not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=209.88s)]
*  exactly being held accountable for because Biden's like really doing anything. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=214.84s)]
*  Kamala's not doing interviews. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=218.6s)]
*  Everybody else is like melting into the woodwork. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=220.2s)]
*  And all the books are coming out saying that nobody really knew what they were doing anyway. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=222.44s)]
*  So I think that is a problem. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=225.64s)]
*  And I also believe that if the Democrats want to fly to the border, now they want to go? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=228.2s)]
*  Now they want to check? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=233.92s)]
*  And so I'm for the rule of law. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  And I think this is actually a very interesting case. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=237.48s)]
*  The White House had said, they said on Monday that for 72 hours the press got it wrong and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=241.28s)]
*  that the Supreme Court's decision was actually in their favor 9-0. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  And complained then that the press got it wrong for 72 hours. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  Also like, well, then if they got it wrong, then 72 hours on that day, like tell everybody. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=256.04s)]
*  And then you could have a debate and you could have some people saying they're right, they're [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=260.48s)]
*  wrong. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=263.8s)]
*  Jonathan Churley on America's Newsroom today thought that the White House had a good point. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=264.8s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=267.96s)]
*  I actually don't know where it goes from here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=269.92s)]
*  I'm curious to hear what the judge thinks because at this point going down to get him [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=271.32s)]
*  doesn't seem, I don't think Van Hollen is coming back with Maryland. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=276.76s)]
*  Excuse me, El Presidente. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=281.88s)]
*  I'd like to see MS-13 in the mega prison. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=283.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=285.68s)]
*  Well, Kayleigh has already said in answer to CNN, Kaitlyn Collins in the Oval Office [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=286.68s)]
*  yesterday, he says, number one, you know, I am not going to release him to the United [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=291.32s)]
*  States. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=299.76s)]
*  I don't have the power to take him out of a prison and force him to come to your country, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=300.76s)]
*  number one. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=305.92s)]
*  And number two, I don't want to release this gang member out of my prison and put him in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=306.92s)]
*  my country that I have turned from one of the most violent countries in the murder [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=311.72s)]
*  capital of the world. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=315.6s)]
*  I'm not going to allow him to go out and kill my people, which is a real commentary on this [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=317.04s)]
*  night. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=321.72s)]
*  Look, this is very simple. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=322.72s)]
*  Two courts have ruled that this guy is an MS-13 gang member. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=323.72s)]
*  He has been deported as a result of a hearing and an appeal by an immigration court. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=329.44000000000005s)]
*  He came here not as a member of, not through any asylum claim. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=335.92s)]
*  He didn't come through a port of entry. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=342.44s)]
*  He was a gotaway. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=344.8s)]
*  He didn't come in as a protected status person. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=346.0s)]
*  He is a gotaway who decided to come into this country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=349.56s)]
*  He's been here for 11 years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=353.8s)]
*  There is a reliable document that he's a member of MS-13, but even that doesn't matter anymore [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  Because there are two courts, immigration courts, that ordered him deported. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=362.28s)]
*  He did not make any kind of case that allowed them to decide that he shouldn't be deported. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=366.84s)]
*  Now let's take that to where we are now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=374.12s)]
*  In addition to the fact that he's illegal, he's from El Salvador, he's in El Salvador [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  now, no local district court judge has the right to say to the United States, you better [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=383.56s)]
*  go over there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  We're going to take you to the jail, team six, over to the prison in El Salvador and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=390.72s)]
*  bring this guy back. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=394.0s)]
*  He doesn't belong here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=395.24s)]
*  He's illegal. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=396.88000000000005s)]
*  He came here illegally. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=397.88000000000005s)]
*  Immigration courts said get your tail out of this country. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  And now the Democrats are freaking out. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=402.68s)]
*  This guy, Van Halen, this senator, he should be ashamed of himself. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=404.6s)]
*  If you want to go over there and you want to check on an illegal who was in this country [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=408.72s)]
*  illegally and is a member of MS-13 and you don't want to talk about Rachel Moran, who [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=414.68s)]
*  is from your state. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=420.64s)]
*  This is an example. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=422.96s)]

*  Today he figured out he shouldn't have. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  This is the problem. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  We've got people who belong in Congress, who've been elected to Congress, who are worried [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=431.8s)]
*  about illegal criminals and not worried about American citizens like Joe Biden. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=436.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's the reason we're in this mess in the first place. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=442.4s)]
*  Start caring about American citizens. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=445.52s)]
*  Hi. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=449.2s)]
*  So Senator, now I'm going to say Van Halen because you did, which makes him a little [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=452.84s)]
*  bit cooler. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  But did speak about Rachel Moran and has since she was murdered. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  First and foremost, Abrego Garcia, there is no proof that he was an MS-13 member. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=468.68s)]
*  And it has been debunked many times. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=474.8s)]
*  Yes it has. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=477.88s)]
*  It was. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=478.88s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=479.88s)]
*  In the court of law, a section I-113 or 123 is reliable, verifiable, proof that you were [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=480.88s)]
*  a member of a gang and he was never able to rebut it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=489.72s)]
*  It was based on double hearsay testimony and also a detective who was indicted merely weeks [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=493.48s)]
*  later for providing confidential information to a sex worker. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=500.04s)]
*  He was also allegedly an alcoholic. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  That's how we got into this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=505.72s)]
*  The point is that this man has been living in this country out in public meeting on an [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=506.72s)]
*  annual basis with his DHS caseworker. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=511.76000000000005s)]
*  He goes in once a year. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=515.64s)]
*  He talks to them. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=517.4s)]
*  They know where he works. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=518.4s)]
*  He's an on the books worker. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=519.4s)]
*  This is not somebody who is a gang banger. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=521.72s)]
*  This is not somebody who has committed any other crime besides being here in this country. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=524.4s)]
*  And he came here also based on credible threat of being murdered by a gang at home who was [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  threatening his entire family. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  The reason that Democrats are talking about the fact that anyone could quote unquote be [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  disappeared is that you can see a full blown constitutional crisis playing out in front [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=540.36s)]
*  of our eyes. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=545.96s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled nine zero that he had to be returned. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=546.96s)]
*  President Buccagly is lying when he says that he can't get him back. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=550.76s)]
*  We know that he can return people because he returned people from the original shipment. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=554.84s)]
*  There were women that were sent there and he said, oh no, no, no, you shouldn't be here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=558.66s)]
*  And there were some Venezuelans that he didn't want. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=561.88s)]
*  He said, OK, you shouldn't be here. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=563.48s)]
*  And he shipped them on back. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=565.5200000000001s)]
*  They think that it's funny getting that hot mic moment where Donald Trump and the El Salvadoran [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=567.0s)]
*  president are talking. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  They're kind of loitering around at the front of the Oval Office where they're joking about [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  like, oh, wouldn't it be great if you could take our homegrown ones? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=576.48s)]
*  You cannot legally send Americans to an El Salvadoran prison camp no matter what they [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=579.5200000000001s)]
*  have done. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=583.72s)]
*  Senator Kennedy was on our air earlier this afternoon with Sandra and John and said as [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=584.72s)]
*  much. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  OK, you look. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  There's one more thing to say, actually multiple more things to say. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=591.92s)]
*  But what is most important is that under the Alien Enemies Act, you deserve due process. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=595.04s)]
*  And that's what the Supreme Court ruled. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=601.64s)]
*  And if you go back to World War Two, when we were invoking this same act that people [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=603.14s)]
*  who were here undocumented from Japan, from Germany, from Italy, were allowed to go into [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  a court where they could argue that they weren't a danger to this nation, Abrego Garcia was [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=613.4799999999999s)]
*  not afforded that right to come into court and to argue as to why he should not be deported. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=618.48s)]
*  And it is not the same thing to deport someone to their home country as to send them to a [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=624.98s)]
*  prison. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=628.36s)]
*  Well, then, you know that first of all, the nine zero decision by the Supreme Court held [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=629.36s)]
*  that the judge was wrong to think that she or he could enjoin the whole nation and dictate [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  to a president international policy. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=640.64s)]
*  His return. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=643.16s)]
*  No, no. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=644.16s)]
*  The facilitation, as the attorney general itself said, was that if they decide to return [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=645.76s)]
*  him, no judge can tell the president you have to go into another country and pull a citizen [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=650.24s)]
*  of that country and bring him back here when he's illegal here in the first place. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=656.88s)]
*  Greg, is this a constitutional crisis? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=661.52s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=664.04s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=665.24s)]
*  I honestly don't care. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=666.92s)]
*  I don't do you know, I bet the viewers at home feel this narrative at work. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=667.92s)]
*  What is strange about this story? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=673.88s)]
*  What is the strange thing about this story? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=676.24s)]
*  The majority of Americans favor deportation of illegals, especially those who are criminals, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=678.3s)]
*  but they favor deportation of illegal. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=684.28s)]
*  The last, what, eight days, seven days has been around about one person. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=687.0s)]
*  One person. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=692.4s)]
*  I don't even know his name. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=693.4s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=695.08s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=696.28s)]
*  If he's illegal, he's got to go. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=698.04s)]
*  We are not responsible for the faulty process that allowed him to be here before. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=700.04s)]
*  Is he a terrorist? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=704.98s)]
*  Is he not a terrorist? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=705.98s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=707.02s)]
*  Let me give you an analogy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=708.4s)]
*  This will be good for you because you like sports. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=710.12s)]
*  You walk down your box seats, there's somebody sitting in your seat, and you go, why is this [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=712.0s)]
*  guy sitting in my seat? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=716.54s)]
*  And they go, well, he's not supposed to be there. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=718.18s)]
*  But you know, he's a family man. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=720.88s)]
*  He's got a job. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=722.44s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but you know, that's not on me. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=724.24s)]
*  That's my seat. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=727.92s)]
*  Do you have a process for having him leave that seat? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=728.92s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=732.28s)]
*  Can he go back to his seat? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=734.76s)]
*  Why doesn't he go back to his seat? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=737.0s)]
*  It's not my concern where that seat is. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  He's got to go. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=741.4s)]
*  Yes, but did you know he's been trying really hard to be a good citizen? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=742.4s)]
*  He's you know, he's he's really quiet. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=746.56s)]
*  You know, he's not me. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=748.8399999999999s)]
*  No, no, you don't understand. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=749.8399999999999s)]
*  He's got to go. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=751.16s)]
*  Now, we knew that this process wouldn't be easy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=752.16s)]
*  You know, it was really easy for Democrats to open the floodgates and be seen as the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=757.16s)]
*  heroes. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=762.2s)]
*  Look how compassionate we are. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=763.2s)]
*  It's always going to be harder to send them back. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=764.72s)]
*  It's and you're going to be treated like a villain every single step of the way because [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=767.8s)]
*  adults fix the problems that children's cause. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=772.8s)]
*  And sometimes the adults have to do big stuff to fix the big problems that were caused by [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=777.16s)]
*  Democrats who are in this case, are the children. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=783.08s)]
*  As for this, you know, why are they talking about this disappear fear? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=786.92s)]
*  It's because the bat signal went up last week. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=790.52s)]
*  It was chaos. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=792.92s)]
*  Now it's disappear fear. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=794.12s)]
*  You put it on the mountain of imaginary concerns along with paper straws, the climate apocalypse, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=795.68s)]
*  Russian collusion, white supremacy, Musk is a Nazi. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=803.28s)]
*  This is this is what I mean when you can feel the narrative. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=807.36s)]
*  You can feel it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=810.36s)]
*  You go like, oh, now I understand this. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=811.36s)]
*  This whole thing, this guy is nothing more than a tool that is being used to subvert [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=814.8s)]
*  the needs and concerns of the American public. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=821.08s)]
*  This is why they're latching onto it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=823.6s)]
*  You mentioned how the deportation in a way has the same issues as the invasion. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=826.0s)]
*  It's a mirror. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=831.6s)]
*  Biden opened the border. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=832.6s)]
*  Millions came in and surely murderers and rapists were part of that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=834.6s)]
*  Now we're deporting hundreds of thousands and surely one or two might not be criminal. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=839.0s)]
*  However, compare the error in one of these errors. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=844.88s)]
*  Americans don't die. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=848.52s)]
*  At worst, a guy gets sent to a country he doesn't want to go to. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutiDyB39Q&t=850.52s)]
