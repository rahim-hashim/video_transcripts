*  hearing so I thought I'd bring one as well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=37.68s)]
*  This of course we know is President Elon Musk. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=40.82s)]
*  We know that he is leading a power grab also abided by and encouraged by Donald Trump. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  They want to look into your kids' lunch money. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=50.16s)]
*  It's about helping Elon Musk and Donald Trump be as efficient as possible in robbing our [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=52.48s)]
*  government. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=58.279999999999994s)]
*  Hmm, but it could have been a lot worse. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  At least they didn't burst into song. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Which side are you on? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=65.36s)]

*  No weelands kept within our walls. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=74.72s)]
*  We'll fight from dawn to dusk. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=78.12s)]
*  Which side are you on? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=81.64s)]
*  The losing side. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=82.84s)]
*  But the Obama pod bros are taking a different approach lamenting how Doge beat them to the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=84.56s)]
*  punch. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=89.28s)]
*  I've seen the messaging memos and it's like you know the young people, Gen Z, they like [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=90.28s)]
*  Doge and what Elon's doing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  We all know that government is slow. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  We all know that government can be inefficient. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=98.68s)]
*  We all know that the bureaucracy can be bloated. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=100.28s)]
*  We all worked in the f***ing White House. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=102.18s)]
*  We tried to reorganize the government. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=103.58s)]
*  We tried to find efficiency. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  It's hard to do. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=106.58s)]
*  And honestly some of this is pretty annoying because it's some of the stuff we should have [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=107.58s)]
*  done. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=109.88s)]
*  You know you could do some of this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  They're working through the stages of grief. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=114.0s)]
*  It happening just moments ago. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  President Trump defending Musk from the constant attacks from the left. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=117.72s)]
*  But I want to commend Elon because he's done a fantastic. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=121.24s)]
*  He doesn't need this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=124.32s)]
*  You know he's abused by you people every day. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=125.32s)]
*  He's found more things than anybody could find. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=128.32s)]
*  I think he's got the credibility to do it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=130.68s)]
*  I know he does. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=132.56s)]
*  You know Jesse, the Gutfeld theory of public singing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=133.56s)]
*  You know you've run out of ideas if you feel compelled to burst into song. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=138.16s)]
*  When you're singing you're losing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=142.4s)]
*  The Democrats look like Code Pink with better clothes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=144.28s)]
*  Greg, they are losing the information war. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=147.16000000000003s)]
*  And it's easy because there's no victims they're pointing to. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=150.8s)]
*  Where are the children going hungry? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=154.84s)]
*  Where are the veterans that can't get aid at the VA? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  There's none. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  The victim is the taxpayer. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  Obama did try to figure this out but he failed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=163.4s)]
*  We have a retirement paperwork cave where hundreds of people are working for the government [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=166.66s)]
*  and writing things out in longhand. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=172.46s)]
*  He tried to computerize it for a hundred mil, failed, so hired more people to work in the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=174.92s)]
*  cave. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=179.7s)]
*  It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=180.7s)]
*  Musk is working for Trump. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=183.74s)]
*  Trump hired the world's richest man. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=186.5s)]
*  That's a flex. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=189.7s)]
*  That's what you call a power move. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=191.16s)]
*  And he's working for free. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=192.68s)]
*  It's like good cop, bad cop. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=194.24s)]
*  Musk is going out there and firing people and cutting spending and Trump's just at the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=196.42s)]
*  Super Bowl and bringing hostages home. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=200.61999999999998s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=203.34s)]
*  And he's only going to do this for about a year and a half. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=204.33999999999997s)]
*  I think there's the deadline. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=206.06s)]
*  It's kind of like this show. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=207.06s)]
*  Greg Gutfeld is like Musk. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=208.54s)]
*  He's the bad cop. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=210.5s)]
*  He whines, he complains, he kind of makes moves and gets things done for the rest of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=211.78s)]
*  us. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=216.98s)]
*  Well, I sit back and look good. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=217.98s)]
*  That's what's going on right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=219.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=222.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  I know, Dana, this cave thing is insane. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=225.5s)]
*  Do you know a lot of, okay, what is, how did this, how come we don't, how could we didn't [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=229.86s)]
*  know about this? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=235.5s)]
*  We did. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=236.94s)]
*  No, and actually many reporters have reported on over the years. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=237.94s)]
*  In 2014, there was a big piece in the Washington Post and then Selena Zito did it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=240.86s)]
*  And this is like, what is this, what's going on here? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=245.0s)]
*  So that's why the Pod Save America guys are like, yeah, we know about these things. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=247.18s)]
*  And they were ineffective in getting anything done because you bump up against the bureaucratic [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=250.62s)]
*  wall. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=256.22s)]
*  You have other priorities, you're like, fine, do the retirement underground, whatever. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=257.22s)]
*  But when you have somebody like Elon Musk working for free and they've got all the young [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=261.42s)]
*  people saying that we can fix this in 10 minutes, like, let's go ahead and do it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=265.18s)]
*  When the Dems were singing today, I thought about the judge because not because she sings, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=269.52s)]
*  but the Democrats can't prosecute their case. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=274.98s)]
*  If this was in front of her courtroom, I feel like you would say in my chambers and say, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  get it together using your book title and say, you guys are making fools of yourselves [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=283.18s)]
*  and I'm trying to help you here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=287.24s)]
*  And if not, I'm going to call a mistrial and you're out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=288.44s)]
*  The Democrats are doing three things wrong. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=291.58s)]
*  One, they're making it about the age of the engineers. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=293.28s)]
*  They already lost young people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  Why do you want to lose more of these young people? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=298.0s)]
*  They also are rallying behind unpopular government workers. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=300.56s)]
*  I know there are a lot of great government workers who have dedicated their lives and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=305.06s)]
*  their career. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=308.64s)]
*  I know all of that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=309.64s)]
*  But we do know that there are a lot of people who have been coasting for a long time on [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=310.64s)]
*  the taxpayer dollars and there's just not a lot of sympathy there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=315.38s)]
*  And three, they are dying on the Douglas Hills defending USAID, defending the CFPB and saying [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=319.94s)]
*  it was about consumers, saying that it's so outrageous. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=325.9s)]
*  There's a constitutional crisis because someone put out a tweet and then they think that the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=330.22s)]
*  28th Amendment is real because Biden put out a tweet about the Equal Rights Amendment. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=333.86s)]
*  All of this is discoverable and they are just terrible at prosecuting their case. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=338.1s)]
*  Yeah, you know, today, Judge, this guy, Hayward Talcone, doesn't matter, said you could save [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=342.1s)]
*  a trillion a year from just from the entitlement program abuse. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=348.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=353.3s)]
*  I mean, that seems like a pretty good high ground for the Republicans. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=354.3s)]
*  Where can the Dems, what are the Dems going to do? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=358.54s)]
*  The whole thing is absurd. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=361.3s)]
*  It absolutely makes no sense. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=362.54s)]
*  You have a war on waste and the Democrats are, you know, and they're they're having [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=364.1s)]
*  a breakdown over the thing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=368.86s)]
*  You know, their biggest argument is that Elon Musk is unelected. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=370.5s)]
*  No one else in the executive branch is elected. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=375.96s)]
*  Only the president is elected. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=379.22s)]
*  Why aren't you complaining about other people? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=381.1s)]
*  At least the government's not paying Elon Musk. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=382.98s)]
*  The guy's working for free. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=385.7s)]
*  No one else is elected. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=387.42s)]
*  And the crazy part about it, this guy that you were talking about, Tarloff, what's his [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=388.74s)]
*  name? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=394.3s)]
*  I think his name is Hayward Talcone. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=395.3s)]
*  Well, one of the things he talked about is that 20 percent of the government expenditures [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=398.3s)]
*  amount to waste and fraud, whereas in the private sector, only three percent is waste [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=403.94s)]
*  and fraud. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=408.90000000000003s)]
*  And when you put that together with what Musk was talking about yesterday when he was in [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=410.38s)]
*  the Oval Office, which is one of the images that people object to, he said, you know what, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=414.22s)]
*  how is it the people who only make a hundred a couple hundred thousand dollars a year end [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=418.7s)]
*  up owning, you know, having tens of millions of dollars after they serve in Congress? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=423.58s)]
*  Clearly, there's something off here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=431.3s)]
*  So the funny thing is, Musk is. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=433.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=435.74s)]
*  That's very good. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=437.14s)]
*  And finally, this is what the American people wanted. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=438.14s)]
*  They voted for it and they're getting it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  You know, Harold, it's just the time when you step in and go, but it's not constitutional. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=443.5s)]
*  The Congress is known as the purse for a reason. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=448.62s)]
*  Well, I'll have you know that, you know, USAID was founded on an executive order. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=451.9s)]
*  So I'll just kill that idea. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=456.86s)]
*  But it's fun that every look, I'm glad to be back with everybody. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=458.58s)]
*  It's good to see no one's lost their their ability to get fired up. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=460.74s)]
*  I'd say just just a couple of things. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=464.54s)]
*  I support what Elon Musk is doing. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=466.98s)]
*  I think that this whole idea about finding things in government that aren't working, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=469.22s)]
*  finding things we're paying too much for, we should figure out ways to do it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=474.46s)]
*  Judge, I think when he was talking about the people making a couple hundred thousand and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  now being worth tens of millions, he was talking about people in the executive branch. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=480.82s)]
*  I thought that's why I'm talking about Congress. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=484.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think he was also, you know what, we can both win on that because I can definitely [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=486.62s)]
*  point to people in Congress who came in with virtually nothing and left with tens of millions. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=490.65999999999997s)]
*  So he we I hope that as he's looking at I don't know those people, I look like I only [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  get a minute. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=501.09999999999997s)]
*  Does one of them rhyme with Harold Ford? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=502.09999999999997s)]
*  People Mr. Musk has every right to do what he's doing when people say that he's not [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=503.82s)]
*  elected, he's not elected, but the others had to take go through a confirmation hearing [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=508.86s)]
*  and an oath and then sign documents saying they're not going to commit it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=512.34s)]
*  They're not going to conflict themselves. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=515.78s)]
*  I believe he won't do it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=516.78s)]
*  And I believe the president's going to hold them to it to at the end of the day. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=518.1s)]
*  If what the president and Mr. Musk really want to do is to to figure out ways in which [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=523.74s)]
*  to reduce spending. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=527.92s)]
*  You can't do it the way you're doing it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=530.02s)]
*  You got to do it going forward. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=532.7s)]
*  The president ought to submit a budget and zero out USAID, zero out the Department of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=533.82s)]
*  Education. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=538.1s)]
*  The things they're trying to do, I think why Democrats are so frustrated, I think even [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=539.1s)]
*  some Republicans judging everyone around the table is that we all said since November that [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=541.98s)]
*  Donald Trump has essentially been the president of the United States. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=546.6600000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden disappeared from the stage and the joke that Donald Trump was running things. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=550.46s)]
*  Now he's officially running things. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=554.14s)]
*  So now that you're officially running things, there's no need to look back. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=555.82s)]
*  If you want to zero out salaries of people at departments or agencies that aren't working, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=559.04s)]
*  zero them out. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=564.3s)]
*  But you can't go back and do it the way you're doing it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=565.3s)]
*  We have something called Marbury versus Madison, which the judge certainly knows, which says [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  that courts and judges have the absolute right to determine the constitutionality of laws [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=571.9599999999999s)]
*  and statutes. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=578.0s)]
*  No one has said that the president can't go forward and say zero these things out. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=579.28s)]
*  I think Democrats are very clumsy. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  I would agree. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=584.64s)]
*  I don't know why you have to sing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=585.64s)]
*  If you're going to oppose what he's doing and just say we oppose it and these are the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=587.24s)]
*  reasons we oppose it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=591.04s)]
*  I differ with Democrats who oppose him because he's trying to reform it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=592.04s)]
*  I agree with them when they say he can't go backwards or retrospectively try to do this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=596.08s)]
*  Finally to Mr. Musk, I got a lot of thoughts. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=602.84s)]
*  We got a couple more segments here. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=605.12s)]
*  If we're going to find ways in which to make to balance the budget, let's look for some [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=607.08s)]
*  big items. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=611.12s)]
*  Denying nutrition programs for people in rural America, that's not big. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=612.6s)]
*  Trying to cancel or minimize Alzheimer's and cancer research, come on, give me a break. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=617.6s)]
*  Finally, wear a blazer when you go into the White House, when you go into the Oval Office. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=622.2s)]
*  I'm a big believer. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=625.32s)]
*  I told John Fetterman to put a suit on when he goes to the floor. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=626.32s)]
*  Put a blazer on when you stand next to the president and tell us when you're going to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=628.72s)]
*  dictate and educate us on how we should reform our government and reduce spending. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=631.8s)]
*  Something I think you're largely right on. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=636.48s)]
*  Harold, I have to take umbrage with the whole moving forward thing. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=639.7600000000001s)]
*  If somebody commits a crime and somebody tells you, you should move forward, you have to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=644.12s)]
*  look backward if a crime is committed. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=649.2s)]
*  You have to look and see. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=650.84s)]
*  Saying you're going to move forward basically absolves the people of the horrible things [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=653.4000000000001s)]
*  they did. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=656.6400000000001s)]
*  He would be absolving himself too. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=657.6400000000001s)]
*  He was president five years ago. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=658.6400000000001s)]
*  All I'm saying is zero it out. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=659.6400000000001s)]
*  What they're trying to do is unconstitutional. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=662.4000000000001s)]
*  No one around the table wants to admit it, but they can't go backwards and say take that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=663.4000000000001s)]
*  funding away. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  You can only go forward. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=668.72s)]
*  It was signed in the law. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=669.72s)]
*  The reason a tick tock law is the law is because Congress passed it, the president signed [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=670.72s)]
*  it and it has the added advantage of having the Supreme Court of the United States ratify [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=674.64s)]
*  it as a law. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=678.62s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=679.94s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=680.94s)]
*  Let's agree to disagree. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=681.94s)]
*  In your face. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=682.94s)]
*  He got me. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=683.94s)]
*  Yeah, basically what you're saying is just let them keep paying all these people until [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=684.94s)]
*  next year. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=690.52s)]
*  I don't think that works. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=691.52s)]
*  How can you do it otherwise? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=692.52s)]
*  What's the law? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=693.52s)]
*  Tell me, Judge, how do you do that? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=694.52s)]
*  Look at the Department of Education. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=695.52s)]
*  Tell me how do you do it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=696.52s)]
*  Let me answer you. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=697.52s)]
*  The Department of Education was created by an executive order by Jimmy Carter. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=699.3199999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=701.88s)]
*  If Donald Trump wants to destroy it by executive order, he should be able to do the same thing. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=702.88s)]
*  So let's not act like this is just something that is only capable of being done by cameras. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=706.6s)]
*  Because the truth is that is fraud and corruption. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=711.84s)]
*  I have to look the other way if there's fraud and corruption. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=715.3199999999999s)]
*  You corrected. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=717.8s)]
*  Or people are getting kicked back. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=718.8s)]
*  No, I prosecute it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=719.8s)]
*  Can you go back? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=720.8s)]
*  I prosecute it and I stop it. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=721.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=724.0s)]
*  That's exactly what he should do. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=725.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=726.0s)]
*  That's what he's doing right now. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=727.0s)]
*  I don't want my money. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=728.48s)]
*  I know. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=729.48s)]
*  Look, these are just facts that are uncomfortable for you. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=730.48s)]
*  But that's a good point. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HzXHoj8Lvs&t=732.48s)]
