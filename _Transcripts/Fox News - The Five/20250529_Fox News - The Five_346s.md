# ‘The Five’: How will the admin go about revoking visas?
**Fox News - The Five:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ)
*  We're playing nice with China's campus snooping or IP snatching the State Department will begin aggressively [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Remoking some Chinese student visas and for good measure the United States grants about [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  300,000 student visas to Chinese nationals every year all this heat while Trump teams square off with [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Harvard in court the federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=19.56s)]
*  But 47 is giving Harvard and out all they have to do is behave [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=27.32s)]
*  We want to know where those students come are they troublemakers? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=32.72s)]
*  What countries do they come and we're not gonna if somebody is coming from a certain country and they're [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=35.64s)]
*  100% fine Harvard's got to behave themselves Harvard is treating our country with great disrespect [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=41.56s)]
*  I'm looking out for the country and and for Harvard. I want Harvard to do well [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=46.4s)]
*  I want Harvard to be great again [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=50.18s)]
*  Probably Harvard wants to fight they want to show how smart they are and they're getting their ass kicked [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=53.04s)]
*  But they were misbehaving at their graduation earlier today watch [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=58.92s)]
*  Members of the class of 2025 from down the street across the country and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=63.8s)]
*  Around the world around the world just as it should be [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=72.28s)]
*  So many of your international students worry about [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=78.88s)]
*  Being wrongly detained and even deported a cascade of draconian government measures [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=82.4s)]
*  Has already led to so much uncertainty so much pain and suffering in this country [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=88.88s)]
*  All right, let's start with the revoking of the Chinese visas Dana, how would you go about that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=98.72s)]
*  Do you just revoke all of them at the same time or do you try to find who the troublemakers are? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=105.16s)]
*  I [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  Again, this is one of those questions. So what problem are we trying to solve? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=113.28s)]
*  Is it that they have too many or is it that the Chinese? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  Have a law that says if you are no matter where you are in the world if you're a Chinese citizen [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=119.28s)]
*  Even if you go to Harvard, then you have to report back to us and for years many colleges [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  And it's not just Harvard like all across the country. They [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=128.92s)]
*  Utilize foreign students to pay full freight and then they use that money to basically pad the administrative bloat [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=131.72s)]
*  There's many more administrators and there are teachers and then they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  basically, we know that the some of the Confucius centers and things have been [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=142.84s)]
*  Awkward to say the least and then research is stolen not just from universities [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=148.0s)]
*  But then you also have corporate corporate espionage as well [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  So there's lots of reasons to look into this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=156.44s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure if you do this like is it everybody who's here at the moment as are all those revoked [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=158.88s)]
*  We're going into summer vacation. Do they go home? Do they not? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=165.16s)]
*  I mean, I I get that and I think there's an argument to be made that foreign students do contribute to the American economy [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=167.96s)]
*  Especially remember the whole thing about we basically [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=173.68s)]
*  Especially for example Indian students should we just as President Trump once said should we just basically give them a visa to work here? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=177.04s)]
*  Once they graduate from one of our universities because we'd rather have them working here than working against us somewhere else [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  So there's all of that to be said but the longer-term answer has to be even stricter requirements [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=188.72s)]
*  I'm sure you have people, you know, Jesse [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=193.76s)]
*  Like it's not easy to get into some of these Ivy League schools or even not even Ivy League schools anymore [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=195.76s)]
*  You have to know a trustee you have or or you have to be a foreign student, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=201.72s)]
*  Right that will pay full free or you have to be a great squash player [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=206.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a great question [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  You have to be a great squash player. Yeah or a fencer fencing is really good. Is the ticket? Yes, Greg [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=211.64s)]
*  I'm sure this Chinese visa attack might have something to do with negotiating the trade deal [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=218.55999999999997s)]
*  It could be but I want to talk about Harvard first. I have mixed feelings about this topic on one hand [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=224.11999999999998s)]
*  I don't care on the other hand. I love watching Democrats care [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=230.89999999999998s)]
*  It's fun to see them get wound up over Harvard's plight, you know talk about a party of the people [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  You know, what while you're at it the Dems should come out on the behalf of like high-end pet care and infinity pools [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=240.96s)]
*  Maybe home theaters it fits [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=247.56s)]
*  This is the party that will fly private to a climate change event or will put their kids in private academies while they [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=249.88s)]
*  campaign against school choice [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=257.44s)]
*  I love that there are students that may be [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=259.92s)]
*  Transferring out right now of Harvard and might go to Oxford [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  I think that this is a hill to die on not homelessness not the debt not drug addiction that some Dubai Prince's son [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=266.84s)]
*  Maybe have may be forced to live in a mansion in London instead of a 5,000 square foot loft in Tribeca [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, that's that's what that's what I want to hear about now [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=281.64s)]
*  The White House. I love this wants to review social media of foreign students to check for anti-american [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  Sentiment or subversion [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  This is good because we learned that this is the only chance you'll be able to really check it because once they get in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  Democrats fight like hell to get them out once somebody is here preaching terror or death to Jews [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  We can't do anything about it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=307.4s)]
*  So this is the only time you can be a bouncer and it makes sense [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  Like if when a company like Fox is hiring, you know [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=312.56s)]
*  You look on their social media if it says death the Fox you don't hire if they say death to Jesse Waters you do [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's like Jessica. It's like hiring a nanny you you know, you'd be happy that you caught the candidates [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=323.0s)]
*  You know saying I hate children on their ex, you know on their ex platformer [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=329.12s)]
*  I I hate Jessica Tarloff because she's too liberal click here to subscribe to the Fox News YouTube page [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSvt7cZ83FQ&t=333.96s)]
