# 'The Five': How Obama used to channel Democrats' two most hated enemies - Elon and DOGE
**Fox News - The Five:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk)
*  Welcome back, super sleuths on the net discovering Barack Obama's most horrifying secret. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=0.0s)]
*  No, not that one, Dana. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  One that could shatter the image forever of our hope-and-change messiah, Roland Lars. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=8.52s)]
*  What should be easy is getting rid of the pointless waste and stupid spending that doesn't [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=14.02s)]
*  benefit anybody. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=18.72s)]
*  Did you know that the federal government pays for a website devoted to a folk music ensemble [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=19.72s)]
*  made up of forest rangers? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=24.76s)]
*  They're called the Fidlin' Foresters. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=26.32s)]
*  I'll put their music on my iPod, but I'm not paying for their website. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=28.4s)]
*  The American people are entitled to transparency. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=31.4s)]
*  By that I mean they're entitled to be able to figure out where their dollars are going. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=34.6s)]
*  Mmm, Barry O was touting the virtues of cutting government waste back in 2011. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=38.4s)]
*  Now where have we heard that one before? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=44.8s)]
*  Jessica, this is quite interesting, don't you think? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=48.08s)]
*  Not really. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=51.2s)]
*  Fidlin' Foresters? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=52.2s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=53.2s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=54.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=55.2s)]
*  Waste, fraud and abuse, huh? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=56.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=58.2s)]
*  You guys invented it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=59.2s)]
*  Well, no, but everybody— [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=60.2s)]
*  Get to the point. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=61.2s)]
*  Is that the red light already? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=62.2s)]
*  Yeah, Democrats don't like waste, fraud and abuse either. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=65.2s)]
*  Go back to what Bill Clinton did. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=69.44s)]
*  Put Al Gore in charge of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  That was a mistake. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=73.64s)]
*  He put Biden in charge. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=74.64s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=75.64s)]
*  He put Biden in charge. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=76.64s)]
*  Oh, this is Biden's fault. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=77.64s)]
*  I love this part of the show. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=78.64s)]
*  It's Biden's fault. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=79.64s)]
*  It's like putting a fox in charge of the— [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=80.64s)]
*  The Hennessy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=82.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=83.64s)]
*  Just go through Congress, work together to do that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=84.64s)]
*  You have Democrats, on the first day they announced Doge, said, sign me up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=88.56s)]
*  I'm happy to do this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=91.84s)]
*  It is widely popular as an idea. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=93.28s)]
*  In execution, though, it's a massive bomb. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=95.36s)]
*  That's what you said, just in the— everything you agree with, except it's not doing well— [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=98.36s)]
*  you're not doing it the right way. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=102.64s)]
*  Do you think that what— like going around in the hundreds of millions of dollars of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=104.04s)]
*  cuts from like Johns Hopkins, Jesse isn't here to defend his sister's honor, but what [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=108.16s)]
*  they're doing there? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=112.64s)]
*  All of our scientific innovation, medical innovation, are coming from these institutes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=114.28s)]
*  Like COVID. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=119.32s)]
*  Like COVID. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=120.32s)]
*  That's such a funny game. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=121.32s)]
*  Where did the virus come from? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=122.32s)]
*  It came from a lab. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=123.32s)]
*  Oh my God, it came from a lab. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=124.32s)]
*  Where did the money come from? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=125.32s)]
*  I can admit it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=126.32s)]
*  Gain of function. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=127.32s)]
*  I'll say all the talking points that you want. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=128.32s)]
*  You're doing one right now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=130.08s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=131.08s)]
*  Yes, you're doing them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=132.08s)]
*  They are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=133.08s)]
*  I found this one example. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=134.08s)]
*  Elon Musk is— [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=135.08s)]
*  This one example that says it's bad. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=136.08s)]
*  $800 million from Johns Hopkins is more than one example. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=138.08s)]
*  Thousands of employees are being fired. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  What are the cuts? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  What are the cuts? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  What are they cutting? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  It's administrative. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  It's redundant. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  Go and look at it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  It has to do with technology. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  The veterans that are getting fired. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  Social security payments. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  They're marking people as dead who are not dead. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  Those are mistakes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  But the thing is, you will agree with this and then you will go, but I don't like the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  way it's being done. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=164.4s)]
*  Well, then how do you do it? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=165.4s)]
*  No, because he's not actually doing it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=167.4s)]
*  You do it like they did in the 90s. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=168.4s)]
*  You don't do it like this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=169.4s)]
*  Elon Musk is getting more and more government contracts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  He's not having to look under the hood of what he's doing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=174.24s)]
*  His companies aren't up for examination, but he's going around doing this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=176.68s)]
*  You know it costs 12 cents per day to keep someone who has HIV alive, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=180.16s)]
*  And we're cutting those contracts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  We're killing people with HIV. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=185.96s)]
*  We are. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=186.96s)]
*  Take a look at the New York Times article from the weekend. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=187.96s)]
*  I was busy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=190.24s)]
*  Brian? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=191.24s)]
*  So, number one, Elon Musk cuts every day because he's got his own private business. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=192.24s)]
*  And if it's not solved, the shareholders are going to keep— [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=196.56s)]
*  That runs off government dollars. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=199.16s)]
*  They don't just primarily run off government dollars, but when you go into space and NASA [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=200.92s)]
*  doesn't want to pay for it anymore and the private industry says, I can't do it, and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  one guy goes, I can do it and I can do it cheaper and I can also put up your—I can [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=208.28s)]
*  also save your astronauts. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=212.32s)]
*  That's a hero. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=213.96s)]
*  He has to lean out of his companies every single day. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=214.96s)]
*  He doesn't need government to do it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=218.44s)]
*  A couple other things I think is important. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=219.72s)]
*  You can't have politicians cut the budget. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=221.76s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Amen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  They have too much stake in the game. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  They will not cut anything that will hurt them politically. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  You are helping them to come in there with accountants and do it apolitically because [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  Republicans are going to get hurt too, and you can't do it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=234.11999999999998s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  Turn the head. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  This is going to hurt, so I'm going to have somebody else do it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  Also, don't blame Elon Musk anymore. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=241.48s)]
*  It's Amy Gleason. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  She is in charge of those. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  She didn't even know she was in charge. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  She's on massive invocation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  She says she was in charge, and she doesn't have to check with Elon Musk on anything. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  It's Amy Gleason. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=251.56s)]
*  Typical Amy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=252.92s)]
*  Judge, what do you make of this? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=253.92s)]
*  What I make of this is everybody is in favor of Doge unless you connect Elon Musk to it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=255.8s)]
*  Then what happens is, and I don't want to go into the next block, but it's Trump derangement [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=261.0s)]
*  syndrome. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=264.68s)]
*  Okay? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=265.68s)]
*  You mention Elon Musk, and then they go ballistic. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=266.68s)]
*  Mark Kelly gets rid of his car. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=270.0s)]
*  And everybody is stuck. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=272.2s)]
*  B buys a gas guzzler. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=273.2s)]
*  B buys a gas guzzler. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=274.2s)]
*  B buys a top line. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=275.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean really instead. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=276.2s)]
*  But you know what I love about this? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=277.2s)]
*  I love the fact that Clinton got rid of 400,000 federal employees. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=278.64s)]
*  Nobody said boo. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=282.68s)]
*  Obama says, I'm getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=283.92s)]
*  And you know who he puts in charge of it? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=286.52s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  Vice President Biden announces the U.S. will halt production of the excess dollar coins [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  and save $5 million a year by not creating the presidential coin. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=295.12s)]
*  That's Joe Biden's effort to try and get rid of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=300.48s)]
*  And he actually said, I have demonstrated continuing commitment to cut waste and protect [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  taxpayers while he was doing just the opposite with his son when he was vice president. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=310.2s)]
*  But the bottom line here is that we've got to cut back on waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  We can do it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=320.28s)]
*  And it just shouldn't be political. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=321.28s)]
*  Brian is right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  Just do it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=324.2s)]
*  Dana, it is kind of interesting watching Obama's demeanor when he was reading that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=325.2s)]
*  It looked like he felt like it was BS. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=330.28s)]
*  He wasn't hiding the fact that he was reading from a teleprompter. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=332.56s)]
*  He didn't mean it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=335.84s)]
*  He didn't mean it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=337.36s)]
*  Maybe he wanted more or maybe he didn't believe in it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=338.36s)]
*  But it was so different than the way Trump does. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=340.68s)]
*  I mean, it's, you know, it's it's. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=342.48s)]
*  It also looks so old. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  If you look back, the video that the Trump folks put out about the El Salvador flight [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  compared to things like this, just how far the White House has come in terms of like [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=352.72s)]
*  President Trump knowing how to use the medium well to his advantage. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=357.8s)]
*  One thing on you mentioned not having politicians try to make the cuts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=361.0s)]
*  That's why they had the Brat Commission on military bases, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=364.48s)]
*  Because the politicians are never going to want to get rid of it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=367.48s)]
*  So they said, fine, the commission can do it and then they can say, it's not my fault. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=369.6s)]
*  They go blame me constituents. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=373.6s)]
*  It's their fault. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  The other problem is Democrats are so entrenched with government unions, which I think government [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=376.52000000000004s)]
*  unions should be reconsidered anyway. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  But so if you're so entrenched with the government union, any cut then is a direct and existential [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=382.92s)]
*  threat to your well-being. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=387.02000000000004s)]
*  Makes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=388.02000000000004s)]
*  Yes, you make a lot of sense, young lady. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjhcDkT9iEk&t=389.02000000000004s)]
