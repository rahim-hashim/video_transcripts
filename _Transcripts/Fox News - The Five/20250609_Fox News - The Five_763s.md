# ‘The Five’: Anarchy breaks out in Los Angeles
**Fox News - The Five:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0)
*  So Democrats are blaming President Trump for the anarchy in Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=0.0s)]
*  Things are a little calmer today, but only after Trump called in the National Guard and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  500 Marines are now on standby. They're ready to take on any anti-ice demonstrators who were burning [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=29.76s)]
*  cars, blocking freeways and pelting police officers with objects. President Trump is [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=35.52s)]
*  slamming the destruction and is warning that California Governor Gavin Newsom could be [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=41.04s)]
*  arrested if he interferes with the ICE raids. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=44.96s)]
*  What do you make of the fact that he says you want a civil war on the streets of America? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=59.76s)]
*  No, it's just the opposite. I don't want a civil war. Civil war would happen if you left it to people like him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=68.08s)]
*  And I liked him. You know, I always got along with him. Never had a problem with him. But he's grossly incompetent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=74.88s)]
*  But Gavin Newsom, he's firing back. California is suing the federal government over the deployment of the National Guard. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  But Gavin Newsom has been daring Trump officials to arrest him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=88.16s)]
*  Put your hands off these poor people. They're just trying to live their lives, man. Trying to live their lives, paying their taxes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=91.36s)]
*  What the hell is this guy? Come after me, arrest me. Let's just get it over with. Tough guy. So Tom, arrest me. Let's go. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=98.96s)]
*  A little deja vu for you. Despite the clear images of burning cars, Democrats and the media kept insisting that the protests were mostly peaceful. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  We are having an administration that's targeting peaceful protests. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=114.4s)]
*  A lot of these peaceful protests are being generated because the president of the United States is sowing chaos. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  So I don't know what all this so-called violence is all about. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm worried about the safety of the people who are peacefully protesting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=129.12s)]
*  The vast majority of protesters and demonstrators are peaceful. They're passionate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=132.88s)]
*  And Maxine Waters waved in here with this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=139.76s)]
*  What are you going to do? Are you going to shoot some kid? He's afraid of you and run. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=145.36s)]
*  You're going to shoot an elected official? If you shoot me, you better shoot straight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know why you're in my city. You did, the governor was not contacted. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=156.08s)]
*  All right, we are here on a Monday, big news day. And Jesse Waters said you were [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=162.08s)]
*  watching all of this over the weekend, had some thoughts. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=165.68s)]
*  Maxine, no relation. You can't blame U.S. soldiers for the violence. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  They're trying to lie just like they lied about Joe Biden. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  This thing started on Friday, covered it Friday night on prime time. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  And then it went on into Saturday and Karen had a stand down order for the LAPD. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=183.6s)]
*  She didn't do anything. She let her whole city burn. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  They only started calling it a riot when Trump mobilized the guard because they got embarrassed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  It was mostly peaceful on Friday and Saturday when the guard comes in. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=200.08s)]
*  Then all of a sudden Trump's triggering violence. It's crazy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=204.4s)]
*  They tell us time and time again, Dana, only the federal government can enforce immigration law. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=208.32s)]
*  So when the federal government enforces immigration law, they break the law? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=214.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. They are siding with foreign terrorists. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=217.6s)]
*  If you are waving a flag of your country and you are burning the flag of the country you've come [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=223.68s)]
*  into, you're not an immigrant. You're an invader. And in a way, I'm glad this is happening. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=229.44s)]
*  I'm glad the whole country gets to see this. This is mass migration laid bare. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=234.24s)]
*  I'm glad we're seeing them throw rocks at cops. Not that they're doing it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=239.2s)]
*  I'm glad the country knows this is not a nuanced position. There's no middle ground here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  You either have a law, either have a border, or you have a country, and that's it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=249.84s)]
*  Now, you cannot have immigration without assimilation. Does this look like a melting pot to you? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't look like a melting pot to me. And California has moved right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=262.64s)]
*  Every county in the country has moved right. So for the Democrats to side with these people, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=267.6s)]
*  it's just crazy. There's money in the big beautiful bill for ICE for these mass migration [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=274.24s)]
*  deportations. You got to do it. Absolutely have to do it. And the pictures that are coming out of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  this, when you have the Tesla terrorism and you have a guy with a flag over a burning vehicle, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=285.6s)]
*  you're going to just jam that right down their throats in the midterm elections. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know how the Democrats can survive siding with Mexican flag waving arsonists. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=295.12s)]
*  Also, Greg, they're burning the American flag and raising the Mexican flag. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=302.16s)]
*  It's disgusting. I mean, this attention is really cutting into Pride Month. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=305.84s)]
*  Seriously, the only thing that should be flaming are the floats. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=311.2s)]
*  Okay, so let's follow the cycle that Jesse talks about. The streets are unsafe, so the troops come [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=314.88s)]
*  into intervene and the damage and media portray the intervention as an escalation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=321.28s)]
*  Haven't you seen this before? They did this with the BLM riots. They did this with the protesters [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=328.4s)]
*  on campus when they would assault students and they know the police better not get there. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=333.76s)]
*  Israel accused of genocide after October 7th. You can even look at male trans in bathrooms, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  men pretending to be women to go into bathrooms. It's not for it's not to avoid attention. It's to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=343.52s)]
*  get attention to act out. This is another example of acting out and then when you react, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=350.56s)]
*  they accuse you of the aggression. They're like the guy who sucker punches a bouncer and then gets [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=357.6s)]
*  his ass kicked. It gets his ass kicked and then wants to press charges. I think the overarching [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  goal here is to recalibrate risk. Obviously, getting violent, deadly illegals out of the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=368.8s)]
*  country will lower your risk as a citizen unless the process creates a counteroffensive [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=375.92s)]
*  that suggests a greater risk, meaning riots. So it's a form of extortion and you may die [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=383.2s)]
*  decide as a California citizen naively that you know it's just not worth the trouble. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=389.04s)]
*  I don't want this mob coming for me. That's what they want to do and you're right. It's like when [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  you see the I mean a guy is waving the flag of the country he doesn't want to go back to. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=397.36s)]
*  It's like a PETA activist wearing a fur coat. It doesn't make sense and yet we're supposed to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  nod along and pretend that that's our problem. It's not our problem. These thoughts were I've [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=409.11999999999995s)]
*  said this earlier that last week these thoughts aren't introduced into our heads. These people [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=415.76s)]
*  expect us to agree with this. No, we don't. We demand if you come here and you're messing [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=421.28s)]
*  with this country and you're waving a flag and you're saying F America, you're going to hear [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=428.16s)]
*  from us. And I imagine Kelly Anne, well I'd love your expertise on the political side of things [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=433.92s)]
*  or even on the law because Governor Gavin Newsom is now suing the government saying Trump's not [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=441.04s)]
*  allowed to do this but also I would imagine that support for deportations will likely go up after [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  people see images like this. They've already been known about actually the president is [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=449.92s)]
*  supported as deportations and everybody's polling. I think CBS, New York Times, they regret [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=454.08s)]
*  asking those questions when they actually see the data in return. They say oh we're not going to do [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=458.64s)]
*  that again but that's changed over time because we all have two eyes and two ears that function [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  and we see what's happening in addition to everything that's been said here that I agree with. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=467.2s)]
*  I think people won't be fooled again. The summer of love as the Democrats insisted it was cost [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=471.28s)]
*  one billion dollars plus that we know of in 2020 and you had all these people from the cappuccino [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=476.56s)]
*  counters and the country clubs Venmoing money to Black Lives Matter. I gotta support them. I gotta [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=482.0s)]
*  put the black square on my Instagram feed and they got fooled. They got roped because those [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=486.48s)]
*  folks bought mansions in California we all saw and what came of that now you're not going to see that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=491.04s)]
*  Instead you see people saying you know what all I see the peaceful folks are the law enforcement [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=496.16s)]
*  who are putting their lives on the line who are out there trying to keep the peace trying to stop [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=501.36s)]
*  the violence watching the American flags being burnt while the Mexican flags are being waved [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=506.16s)]
*  and I think Gavin Newsom wants to be arrested. I think he would be happy to put his hands out [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=510.8s)]
*  right now to Tom Homan or Donald Trump to be arrested. How else to distinguish oneself [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=515.52s)]
*  in a field of no presidential timber but all wood chips going into 2028 and I think he wants to do [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=520.16s)]
*  that. He can go on a hunger or hair hair gel strike from prison and make himself the issue. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=526.0s)]
*  Last thing when Gavin Newsom said to that reporter that friendly reporter to him [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  man these people are just trying to get about their day. These people are? The White House put [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=537.2s)]
*  out a rolling list of pictures and biographies today. Anybody can pull it it's public information. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=542.4s)]
*  Go to WhiteHouse.gov today the White House shows you 15 to 20 examples with their names and their [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=547.92s)]
*  rap sheet of who the criminals are who are being deported. This is not Abuela who's been working [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=553.84s)]
*  hard here for 52 years. These are hardened criminals and it's public information everybody [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=558.96s)]
*  can see it. That's who Gavin Newsom is fighting for. The Democrats now are waving Mexican flags [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=563.92s)]
*  and they have this Maryland dad a gang banger human trafficker who's being returned to the US. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  Be careful what you wish for everybody's grandmother was right being returned to the US and is facing [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  an indictment because for a decade he smuggled people including children. And Harold what do [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  you think about the politics of the Democrats suggesting that all of this that we're watching [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  on air is Trump's fault? So it's good to be back hope everybody have a good weekend. I don't agree [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=589.68s)]
*  with that whoever's saying that. I think a couple things. One you can't defend violence. I don't [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=594.8s)]
*  care what party you're in what party you're not in. And especially you can't defend violence [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=602.16s)]
*  against law enforcement and first responders. To me that's what is the most heartbreaking [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=607.3599999999999s)]
*  and most tragic and then obviously you see the property damage and other things. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=614.4s)]
*  So I'm hopeful that Democrats Republicans alike and I actually understand why President Trump [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=619.76s)]
*  considers I guess we now learn in the last hour that Marines will be deployed. I think it's a [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=625.5999999999999s)]
*  it's a risky situation but when you see situations like this and you see this kind of violence in law [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  enforcement being attacked I think any president is within his means to do that. Two to Democrats [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=634.64s)]
*  stop taking debate. These people whom are out committing these violent acts are not part of [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  the people I think that many are trying to protect or defend or suggest that they deserve [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=647.76s)]
*  due process. These people deserve to be arrested they deserve due process but they deserve to be [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  arrested and those who refuse to refrain or show restraint the police or law enforcement if that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=656.56s)]
*  amount of the military should act against. Finally I think one of the challenges and one of our in [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=662.0s)]
*  house newspapers wrote about it today in an editorial is how do we think about the hierarchy [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=666.96s)]
*  of deportations? I am in the camp the overall majority of Americans who believe that President [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=671.28s)]
*  Trump is right to deport hardened criminals that we should find ways to find that people like the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=677.12s)]
*  guy in Colorado who threw the Molotov cocktail in fact we should survey anybody American or not an [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=682.48s)]
*  American who's on our soil who googles how to make a Molotov cocktail. The question becomes I think [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=687.12s)]
*  and I think what some of these Democrats and even some Republicans if you look at the polling the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=692.8s)]
*  polling's mixed on the president on this about who should should we be deporting dishwashers and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=696.48s)]
*  store clerks and hairdressers and five-year-olds. Jesse corrected me and got me thinking about the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=701.04s)]
*  school situation differently several weeks ago when he said if you find that there's someone in [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=706.64s)]
*  a high school who's a member of a gang you should be able to go into the school. I agree but I don't [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=710.56s)]
*  think you should be able to go and get four and five-year-olds but that's just me talking. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=714.48s)]
*  That's the issue here I think but when Gavin Newsom and others said they want to be arrested [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=718.0s)]
*  when others say why are you in our town and Maxine Waters is like an aunt to me the reason [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=722.56s)]
*  that people are the Marines and that and the President has deployed the National Guard [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=727.28s)]
*  is because the police are being attacked because property is being destroyed and because lives are [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=731.84s)]
*  being threatened and if we as Americans put aside our partisan beliefs if we can't agree on that [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=735.84s)]
*  we've got worse problems than immigrants being on being here illegally. Is she like an aunt? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=741.0400000000001s)]
*  She is wow. She's like no relation to Jesse but like an aunt. She's a sweetheart of her own. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yaoF7jvV0&t=746.32s)]
