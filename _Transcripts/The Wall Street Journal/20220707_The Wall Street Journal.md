# Russia Is Using a Secret Network to Steal Ukrainian Grain  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [July 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA)
*  This satellite image from the port of Sevastopol in Crimea on May 21st shows trucks lined up
*  near a Russian ship loading stolen Ukrainian grain.
*  A Russian soldier who drove one of the trucks around this time explained the details of
*  the smuggling operation.
*  In May, the US State Department sent cables to several countries stating that three Russian
*  ships, the Matros Pozenich, Matros Koshka, and Mikhail Nenasev, were suspected of transporting
*  stolen Ukrainian grain, according to a senior European diplomat who viewed the cable.
*  Russian officials have rejected such accusations.
*  But we found these three ships are part of a smuggling route that Russia has been developing
*  to transport stolen grain out of newly occupied areas of Ukraine and into Russian-allied
*  countries in the Middle East.
*  We analyzed telegram posts, satellite imagery, and ship transponder data, reviewed documents,
*  and interviewed people involved in this illicit trade to reveal a 1,500-mile smuggling route
*  that gives us a window into the broader network Russia has quietly assembled to transport
*  hundreds of thousands of metric tons of grain out of Ukraine.
*  Russia has done this all while obstructing Ukraine from exporting its own grain and seeds.
*  Up to 70 million metric tons per year, a large slice of the world's supply, much of which
*  flows to the developing world.
*  In recent weeks, Ukraine said Turkey detained a Russian ship with stolen Ukrainian grain,
*  while accusations of war crimes and fears of a global food crisis have mounted.
*  The main route we uncovered starts in southeastern Ukraine.
*  In the occupied city of Kamyanka-Neprovska, at one of the largest grain storage facilities
*  in the region, run by a company we aren't naming, we found evidence of dozens of Russian-controlled
*  trucks transporting grain from this facility since early May.
*  The driver we interviewed, a soldier in the Russian army who said he doesn't want to
*  fight in the war, told us that in late May, a Russian colonel ordered him to pick up a
*  load of grain at this facility.
*  Each truck can move around 10 to 50 metric tons of grain in a single haul.
*  In photos from the facility that appear to be from early May reviewed by the journal,
*  we see trucks covered with tarps, Zs on the front, and concealed license plates.
*  The Russian driver we interviewed confirmed that he and the other drivers in his caravan
*  drove similar trucks.
*  Less than 2 kilometers from the depot, this photo, posted to Facebook on May 19th by a
*  local resident, shows trucks with the same characteristics—tarps and no license plates—headed
*  away from the grain storage facility.
*  In satellite imagery from June 11th, we see similar vehicles near the grain silos.
*  A few days later, we can see a line of them outside the facility and a few more in the
*  parking lot as well.
*  By June 22nd, there are over 30 of these trucks visible.
*  The Russian driver said his convoy of trucks with stolen grain drove to Crimea on May 21st
*  or 22nd.
*  We also found evidence that another major grain storage facility in the region was taken
*  over by the Russian military, seen here on March 26th.
*  A satellite image from the same date and location shows what appear to be those same tanks.
*  This letter, from an official installed by Russian forces, informed the company that
*  their property was being seized.
*  After the takeover, the company said they were still able to track their stolen trucks
*  using GPS, which were loaded with grain and also driven into Crimea.
*  At one of the facilities where grain was taken, we can see that a Z—a Russian pro-war symbol—has
*  been marked on the roof.
*  In addition to using truck drivers from the Russian army, drivers for these routes are
*  also hired through messages posted to social media.
*  Like this May 24th telegram post by a logistics operator advertising nearly 20 truck routes
*  to transport grain.
*  Mostly from newly occupied Russian territory in Ukraine to Crimea.
*  This is a route similar to the one our Russian driver took, and offers about $30 per ton
*  in pay.
*  Ukraine's access to export routes out of Crimea has been largely cut off since the
*  2014 annexation.
*  Now, in videos published over the last several weeks, we see long lines of trucks heading
*  south into the region.
*  Many resemble the trucks at the grain depot in Kamyanka-Neprovska and fit the description
*  given by people involved in the trade.
*  Once in Crimea, the Russian driver said he and the other drivers dropped off the trucks
*  at the Sevastopol port, where many tons of grain were unloaded to conveyor belts and
*  then moved to waiting ships.
*  In satellite imagery from Sevastopol on May 19th, 21st, and 23rd, we can see three different
*  ships loading grain, the same ones listed in the State Department cable.
*  The Matros Pozenich, Matros Koshka, and Mikhail Nenasev were all newly registered in the months
*  before the war to a Russian state-owned company called Crane Marine Contractor LLC, according
*  to a ship company database.
*  Satellite images paired with ship tracking data from marine traffic show these same ships
*  running regular routes from Crimea to the eastern Mediterranean since at least late
*  March, often shutting off their transponders as they approach ports, likely in an effort
*  to conceal their locations.
*  For example, the Matros Pozenich disappears from tracking data near Istanbul on May 17th.
*  We then see it being loaded with what looks like grain at the port in Sevastopol two days
*  later.
*  The ship's transponder restarts again on May 21st after it departs Sevastopol.
*  Over the next two days, marine traffic data shows it passes through the Bosphorus Strait,
*  which we can see in photos of the waterway from May 22nd.
*  The ship's tracking is then turned off again as it nears its destination, with its last
*  location reported on May 25th in the Mediterranean Sea between Turkey and Cyprus.
*  Soon after, in Latakia, Syria, satellite imagery shows the ship docked and its contents
*  being unloaded.
*  Commodity brokers involved in the network say the grain was imported by a Syrian state-run
*  grain company.
*  After similar journeys from Sevastopol to the eastern Mediterranean, the Mikhail Nanashev
*  docks in Turkey.
*  The Matros Koschka goes dark for over a week, but reappears as it heads back towards the
*  Black Sea.
*  Crane Marine Contractor LLC and Syria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond
*  to requests for comment.
*  The Russian embassy in Washington, D.C. referred us to a prior statement made by the Russian
*  ambassador to the U.S., in which he rejected accusations of grain theft.
*  The frequency of thefts at grain facilities, combined with the repetition of these vessels'
*  journeys and the sheer number of trucks traveling into Crimea, shows that Russia is working
*  quickly to institutionalize its grain smuggling network.
*  In our last conversation with a Russian truck driver in late June, he said he was waiting
*  to receive orders for his next truck route.
