# Israel Has Invaded Gaza Before. Hereâ€™s What Happened. | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs)
*  Israel has entered what it calls a new phase of its war against Hamas, with a military
*  advance deep into the heart of Gaza.
*  Israel has launched ground invasions of Gaza before, most recently in 2009 and 2014.
*  But this time, Israeli forces plan to go further in a multi-phased offensive into Gaza's sprawling
*  cities with the aim of destroying the military capabilities of Hamas, a US designated terror group.
*  Here's a look at how Israeli ground forces invaded Gaza in 2009 and 2014, and what that
*  reveals about Israel's current operation.
*  Israeli ground forces' most far-reaching military incursion into Gaza came during
*  Operation Kars Lead in 2009.
*  In response to a barrage of Hamas rockets, thousands of Israeli troops entered Gaza from
*  the north and east under the cover of artillery fire.
*  The three-week offensive saw extensive street-to-street fighting as Israeli ground forces pushed
*  towards Gaza City with the aim of taking control of rocket launch sites.
*  You have to understand the way Gaza is built.
*  Yossi Kupavasa is the former head of Israel's military intelligence division.
*  Between the populated area and the Israeli territory, there's an open area.
*  It's very difficult to move towards the populated area because you're totally exposed.
*  As soldiers advanced towards Gaza's major cities, they reported finding dozens of buildings
*  booby-trapped with explosives intended to inflict casualties on Israeli troops.
*  That's why we prefer to prepare the battlefield by a lot of airstrikes to weaken the enemy
*  so that when we enter their abilities are going to be decimated.
*  During the offensive, the IDF remained on the outskirts of Gaza's main cities.
*  This kept Israel's casualties low, but limited its ability to target Hamas infrastructure
*  in built-up areas.
*  We didn't mean to take over Gaza.
*  In 2009, we dealt with the outskirts of some of the main cities, but didn't have any intention
*  to actually enter the centre of town.
*  We didn't put a goal for ourselves, the uprooting of Hamas from Gaza entirely.
*  We realised that Hamas is going to stay in place.
*  And that was a mistake because all these rounds were ended with an agreement that enabled Hamas
*  to rearm itself pretty soon.
*  By the time the operation ended with Israel's implementation of a unilateral ceasefire,
*  1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis had been killed.
*  A UN fact-finding mission found evidence suggesting both Palestinian armed groups and Israel
*  committed actions amounting to war crimes during the conflict.
*  Israel's most recent ground offensive into Gaza was limited in scope to destroying
*  aspects of Hamas infrastructure in the enclave.
*  In July 2014, Israel launched Operation Protective Edge in response to rockets and water fire from Hamas.
*  The Israeli government initially launched an aerial operation to destroy a vast network
*  of underground tunnels Hamas had constructed to store weapons, including rockets fired by the group into Israel.
*  After Hamas militants used a tunnel to launch a raid on a kibbutz in southern Israel,
*  the government's authorised ground troops to cross into Gaza with the aim of destroying cross-border tunnels.
*  Every attempt to enter the Gaza Strip underground involves, first of all, anti-tank missiles, mines,
*  booby traps that are located in places where you want to enter.
*  Israeli troops and armour pushed into Gaza in an effort to locate the entrances to the border tunnels.
*  During the seven-week operation, the IDF said it discovered 62 miles of tunnels.
*  The problem with tunnels is that you don't see them. It was not easy for us to locate them.
*  We had to have a very strong intelligence effort to find out where they are.
*  We had to develop a special technique to explode them and make them not function.
*  Israel says its troops destroyed 32 tunnels, 14 of which infiltrated into Israeli territory.
*  The 2014 conflict ended when troops withdrew from Gaza under a ceasefire agreement reached at the end of August that year.
*  The logic at the time was that we inflicted this heavy blow on the infrastructure,
*  cost them a lot of operatives and deal harshly with their rockets launching capabilities,
*  to the point that they will ask for a ceasefire under our conditions.
*  Sometimes it took longer and sometimes it took shorter time before they resumed the terror operations,
*  but they were always capable of recovering relatively fast.
*  The fighting had killed 2,000 Palestinians and 72 Israelis.
*  A United Nations panel found evidence indicating war crimes may have been committed
*  by both Israel and Palestinian militant groups during the conflict.
*  Israel's previous ground defences in Gaza were much more limited in scope than what its military is aiming to do now.
*  Since Hamas took power in Gaza, Israel hasn't tried to eliminate the group's military infrastructure and leadership in the enclave.
*  For many, many years, in any of the previous rounds, we tried not to end up with taking over Gaza.
*  But it seems that this time we just cannot afford any other solution. We have to take Gaza.
*  A ground invasion with the aim of going into Gaza's cities to destroy Hamas presents one of the biggest challenges the Israeli military has faced in decades.
*  This is a dangerous move for any army. It has to be done slowly and carefully and it costs a lot of lives.
