*  and an exchange of gunfire breaking out in Ukraine's second largest city.
*  The fighting continued across several cities, but the Ukrainian military so far managed to put up a really fierce resistance.
*  It's notable that many ordinary citizens have taken up arms to defend their nation and also resorted to making crude, homemade weapons for protection, such as Molotov cocktails.
*  However, many Ukrainians who chose not to remain headed to train stations to depart for neighboring countries, while others prepared to drive across the border.
*  In a first for the European Union, the bloc said member countries will supply Ukraine with jet fighters.
*  This is a watershed moment.
*  The US and European governments also announced new sanctions that would cut off several Russian banks from the global financial messaging system, SWIFT.
*  As the West stepped up pressure against Moscow, President Vladimir Putin ordered the country's nuclear forces to be put on high alert.
*  To transfer the Russian army's deterrence forces into special mode of combat duty.
*  On Monday, a delegation led by Ukraine's defense minister arrived for talks with Russian officials at the Ukrainian border with Belarus, the first talks since Moscow's invasion.
*  The fact that neither president was present doesn't bode well, because it's really these two men who need to start talking in order for there to be some kind of preparations towards any kind of compromise.
