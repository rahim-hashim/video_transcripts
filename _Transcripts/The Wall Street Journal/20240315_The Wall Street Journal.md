# Mapping Refugee Movement in Gaza as Israel's Rafah Offensive Looms | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz47J2BEqYI)
*  This satellite image shows the sprawling refugee camps in Rafa, at Gaza's southern border.
*  As of early March, more than a million people, the majority of Gaza's displaced population,
*  are sheltering here.
*  As ceasefire talks have stalled and an Israeli ground offensive in Rafa looms, there's no
*  clear plan for where all the people will go.
*  Gaza's main northern city, Gaza City, was home to a little over a million people before
*  the start of the war.
*  Soon after October 7th, Israel began launching airstrikes there in response to Hamas' attack.
*  These images show damage to buildings throughout northern Gaza over time.
*  Gazans began fleeing south.
*  Streams of people left Gaza City by foot on Salah al-Din Road, a central evacuation route.
*  Many went to Han Yunis.
*  This November 30th satellite image shows the UNRWA's Han Yunis camp.
*  This facility was the largest refugee camp in southern Gaza.
*  To the left, a tent city sprung up to accommodate the overflow of displaced people.
*  By mid-December, more than a million displaced people from the north moved into camps in
*  middle Gaza, Han Yunis, and Rafa.
*  By mid-January, nearly 800,000 people were sheltering in the Han Yunis region.
*  Around the same time, Israeli forces circled Han Yunis and instructed residents and refugees
*  to evacuate again.
*  This image from early February shows the camps completely cleared out.
*  As Israeli operations spread throughout the Gaza Strip, southern Gaza, and Rafa in particular,
*  became the last safe place to go.
*  This mid-October image shows Rafa a few weeks into the war.
*  The city was home to roughly 300,000 residents.
*  Over the following months, as refugees fled other areas, the population in Rafa increased
*  dramatically, with an estimated 1.5 million people along the southern border as of the
*  end of February.
*  Satellite imagery shows almost every open space in Rafa covered in tents and temporary
*  shelters.
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now says a ground operation here is imminent.
*  He's ordered the military to draw up plans to relocate the entire population.
*  For the nearly 2 million displaced people in Gaza, that would mean evacuating again.
*  But it's unclear exactly where.
