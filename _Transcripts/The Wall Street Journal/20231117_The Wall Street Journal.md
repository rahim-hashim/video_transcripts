# Why Gazans Donâ€™t Have Enough Water to Survive | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY)
*  People in Gaza have been forced to use seawater to clean themselves, wash their clothes and
*  clean the dishes.
*  This is a result of Israel's siege, which restricted the supply of water, food, fuel
*  and medicine into the Palestinian enclave in response to Hamas' deadly attacks on October
*  7.
*  The World Health Organization said that more than two million Gazans have to get by on
*  just three litres of water per day for drinking, cooking and washing.
*  That's just one-fifth of the absolute minimum of 15 litres needed for basic survival, according
*  to the WHO.
*  Gaza's water crisis began well before the current conflict between Israel and Hamas.
*  Most of Gaza's fresh water comes from a shallow aquifer, which was contaminated with sewage
*  and seawater even before the war.
*  The UN has said that as much as 96% of it is not fit for human consumption.
*  So Gazans had to rely on unregulated private water tankers and desalination plants for
*  drinking water.
*  There are three major desalination plants, while some of the water is purchased from
*  Israel.
*  Years of conflicts worsen the already inadequate water infrastructure.
*  In 2007, Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas took over power in the
*  Strip.
*  That severely restricted the entry of materials to repair and maintain water systems.
*  Then Israel ordered a total siege of Gaza after the Hamas attacks.
*  There is no electricity, no gas, no water, no water.
*  Everything is closed.
*  In the aftermath of the assault, Israel also turned off water pipelines.
*  In late October, Israeli officials said that water was flowing through two of the three
*  pipelines.
*  As fuel started to run out, two of the three desalination plants in Gaza had to shut down.
*  The last desalination plant still in operation was only working at 5% capacity in late October.
*  All wastewater plants in Gaza are shut down due to the lack of power, resulting in raw
*  sewage flooding the streets.
*  Since mid-October, more than 30,000 cases of diarrhoea have been reported, according
*  to the WHO.
*  Over half of those are among children under five years old.
*  The UN's Children's Agency warns that in conflict areas, children under five are 20 times more
*  likely to die of diseases linked to diarrhoea than to violence.
*  Long queues of people waiting to fill jerry cans are now commonplace across the territory
*  as water becomes increasingly scarce.
*  The amount of water on which Gazans rely on now is a fraction of the WHO-recommended
*  range of 50 to 100 litres a day.
*  And it's negligible compared to what people in Israel consume on average every day, according
*  to a UN report.
*  The Israeli military said Gaza has sufficient water supplies as well as access to solar
*  power and diesel.
*  It accused Hamas of limiting civilians' access to those vital resources.
*  Hamas denies this.
*  What Gaza really needs, according to humanitarian organisations, is fuel to restore power.
*  Since the conflicts began on October 7, Israel allowed only half a tanker of fuel to enter
*  the besieged enclave by the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.
*  Fuel here in Gaza is absolutely everything because without fuel, you do not have a generator,
*  you do not have a functioning bakery, you do not have a functioning hospital and you
*  cannot pump water.
*  In mid-November, the UN said 200,000 Gazans lost access to clean water after its two water
*  distribution contractors stopped working due to the lack of fuel.
*  Some aid trucks have entered Gaza in recent weeks, but the UN says they are not bringing
*  in nearly enough fresh water.
