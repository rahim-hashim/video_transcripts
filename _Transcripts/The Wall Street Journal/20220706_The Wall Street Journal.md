Video Description: Many Russian T-72 tanks that are destroyed in Ukraine have a design feature that leads to an explosion and blows off the top. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has put this vulnerability and the future of one of the world’s most popular tanks, the T-72, on public display. 

WSJ takes a look at the jack-in-the-box effect and how this could create challenges for Russia’s weapons industry amid the ongoing war.

# Russia's T-72 Tank Has a Crucial Vulnerability, Complicating Moscow’s Ukraine War  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [July 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI)
*  This is a destroyed turret gun of a Russian tank.
*  It was blown off the vehicle and landed in the second story of a house in Ukraine.
*  Images from the war show many tanks ending up with this type of damage.
*  In some cases, the top of the vehicle flies a significant distance away.
*  We're getting so much video of these tank losses.
*  It's really very illustrative of what's happening in ways that was just invisible in other wars.
*  Tanks play a crucial role in ground warfare.
*  And as the world's second largest exporter of military equipment,
*  Russian-made vehicles are used in countries including India, Iran and Algeria.
*  But hundreds have been destroyed during the war with Ukraine,
*  in what military analysts say could be the biggest loss of Russian tanks since World War II.
*  It's going to be the better part of a decade before they're actually able to get their force back to where they were.
*  The ongoing war has put this vulnerability on public display,
*  complicating Russia's campaign in Ukraine and its production of tanks.
*  While Moscow hasn't said how many of its tanks have been destroyed since the start of the war,
*  at least 440 have been documented by Oryx blog, an open-source military equipment tracker.
*  More than half of these are the same type of tank.
*  To understand why, we need to look at their design.
*  The T-72 was first produced in 1969 with many design iterations since.
*  One of its most distinctive features is also a vulnerability.
*  This is the autoloading mechanism.
*  It reduces the crew from four to three members by removing the person responsible for loading the main gun.
*  Most of the ammunition for this autoloader is stored in the carousel,
*  a kind of metal basket that the gunner sits on top of.
*  The rest is often stored in nooks and crannies around the inside of the tank.
*  Having these elements stacked on top of each other saves space within the T-72
*  and gives it a low profile.
*  It makes it much harder to see from the side, makes it harder to hit.
*  William Albrecht is a director at the London-based think tank,
*  the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
*  He studied arms control and disarmament for more than two decades.
*  Early tanks tended to be relatively tall things.
*  It would be relatively easy for a soldier with an anti-tank missile to take it out from a distance
*  because the higher it is, you can hit the turret from quite a ways away.
*  The compact design has made the T-72 a cost-effective and popular tank
*  with thousands used by militaries around the world.
*  But this design comes with a drawback, what military analysts call the jack-in-the-box effect.
*  That can happen when the explosive material makes its way into the tank, usually through the turret ring.
*  In a T-72, this sparks a chain reaction.
*  The fire sets off the spare ammunition stored around the inside of the tank,
*  which in turn sets off the rest that's stored underneath the crew.
*  If the hatch is sealed, the resulting explosion is pressurized underneath the turret.
*  And this video, filmed by a Chinese television crew in Ukraine, shows what can happen next.
*  Gas builds up, the explosive builds up, and it sends the turret sky high, sometimes meters high.
*  Modern Western tanks like the American M1 Abrams have avoided this design,
*  instead storing ammunition behind an armored wall in the back.
*  This design makes it taller and easier to hit, but if the ammunition is set off, it has a safer outlet.
*  And so the ammunition goes out the back of the turret and doesn't kill the crew,
*  and they used to make us watch videos and things like that just to reassure us that that was the case.
*  Jeffrey Emmons served in the U.S. Army for more than 20 years with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  He's now a research scientist with the Center for Naval Analysis,
*  a nonprofit organization that provides research for the U.S. military.
*  Emmons says the T-72's weaknesses were amplified by Russia's strategy for how the tanks were deployed in Ukraine.
*  Footage released by the Ukrainian military shows Russian tanks driving in convoys towards Kiev.
*  You don't just drive tanks down roads and columns when there's a threat of anti-tank missiles or mines or things of that nature.
*  This initial push left the vehicles exposed to Ukrainian soldiers armed with thousands of high-powered missiles
*  that have been effective at triggering the jack-in-the-box effect.
*  When you look at the modern javelin-type weapons or the in-laws, you have basically the explosion coming from the top.
*  And typically, tanks have very little protection on the top.
*  And so when that happens, that's the second way you could get explosive material inside the crew compartment that could set the ammunition off.
*  But as the war has shifted away from urban centers towards the Donbas region of the country,
*  battles are now taking place on open fields, giving Russia's tanks more of an advantage.
*  The fight in the east is a different fight. It's characterized much more by artillery duels.
*  And that's why I think the Ukrainians are suffering more casualties now than they did at the beginning.
*  Russia's Ministry of Defense didn't respond to a request for comment about the design of its tanks or how they were deployed.
*  Ukraine has also been using the same Russian-made tanks.
*  The military analysts say it's seen comparatively fewer losses, in part by attempting to minimize the tanks' vulnerabilities.
*  In some cases, that means going in with fewer rounds and not storing as much of the powder charges inside haphazardly within the tank that the Russians are.
*  All this could create challenges for Russia's weapons industry.
*  The vulnerabilities of the T-72 are being displayed to tank operators in other countries watching what's happening in Ukraine.
*  It's got to be a little bit terrifying now to be a tanker in a country that has T-72s
*  and to think that you are stepping into a system whose design choice was that if the tank is tough.
*  Western sanctions have also limited Russia's access to microchips and advanced circuitry,
*  stifling their capacity to develop and produce newer tanks and missiles.
*  I think that's going to continue being a problem for their more advanced systems.
*  And with everything else happening with young tech savvy people leaving sanctions, the economic downturn, mid to long term, it's pretty bleak.
