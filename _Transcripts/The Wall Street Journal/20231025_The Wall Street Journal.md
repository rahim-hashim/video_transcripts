# Why the Maze of Tunnels Under Gaza Is Key to the Israel-Hamas War | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk)
*  The Gaza Strip is a densely populated area with more than two million residents, stretching
*  for 25 miles between Israel and Egypt.
*  But just underneath this sprawling landscape, another layer exists, a vast labyrinth of
*  tunnels.
*  The underground maze was largely built by Hamas.
*  The group designated by the US as a terrorist organization controls the Palestinian enclave.
*  As Israel prepares for a potential ground offensive in the territory following a broad
*  assault by Hamas on October 7, the subterranean network could play a key role.
*  So here's why experts say these tunnels could make urban combat costly for both Israeli
*  soldiers and Palestinian civilians.
*  The underground network has existed for decades inside Gaza.
*  Previously it was largely used as a route to smuggle goods and weapons from Egypt into
*  the narrowest strip of land that's twice the size of Washington DC.
*  But since then the tunnels have evolved to become a key military asset for Hamas.
*  I went in 2014 with the IDF into a Hamas-built tunnel during the conflict at that time.
*  It was a pretty crazy experience in a sense.
*  These were pretty sophisticated tunnels.
*  I'm about six foot and they were, you know, I didn't have to bend down at all in them.
*  They were very well reinforced with concrete.
*  There was communications lines running down the side of them.
*  And then they also had like almost like a sort of little rails or like a sort of railway
*  line running along the length of the tunnel.
*  During Israel's seven-week war on Gaza in 2014, the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, said
*  it destroyed 32 tunnels.
*  They were used to hide weapons, equipment and troops, but also allowed Hamas militants
*  to launch surprise attacks using cross-border underground networks.
*  In the years since then, Hamas has continued to develop its tunnel infrastructure and Israel
*  has continued to target it.
*  This map, based on a graphic shared by the IDF, represents networks of tunnels that Israel
*  said it damaged.
*  I think the expectation is that there is still a significant subterranean network that Israel
*  is going to encounter if and when it goes into Gaza this time.
*  Former Israeli security official Say Hamas has built hundreds of miles of underground
*  tunnels in the last year or more.
*  Israel is readying for a possible ground invasion of Gaza by carrying out airstrikes targeting
*  the subterranean network.
*  I think that the Israeli strategy will be to try to destroy as much of the tunnel network
*  as possible before they launch a ground invasion.
*  However, the operation to destroy them could be challenging for Israeli forces.
*  One of the biggest issues is locating them.
*  Gaza is a dense urban environment and being able to discern precisely where a continuous
*  tunnel which may in fact be deep underground is located as opposed to possibly natural
*  pockets of slightly differing geology or a host of other aspects of the built up environment,
*  that's a really hard challenge.
*  Even if a tunnel is located, additional factors including its depth can mean precision bombs
*  can struggle to destroy it.
*  It depends not only on knowing precisely where the tunnel is beneath the surface but on having
*  the explosive power to be able to damage a tunnel network that's beneath perhaps layers
*  of concrete, possibly layers of metal, whatever the built up environment entails inherently
*  as well as whatever materials have gone into construction of the tunnel itself.
*  And the net result is that tunnels are relatively invulnerable in many cases to air attack.
*  Analysts say any Israeli operation to destroy the Gaza tunnel system could be complicated
*  by the presence of hostages.
*  Hamas's armed wing said in a statement on Telegram that some of them were being held
*  in the underground tunnels.
*  The aim is to rescue hostages.
*  They can't be detonating explosives within the tunnel complex which might kill everyone
*  inside.
*  It's going to require ground forces, specifically tunneling forces who know how to operate in
*  these tight spaces, who have trained extensively in how to minimise the risk of ambushes and
*  how to avoid triggering various booby traps.
*  One 85-year-old hostage who was released by Hamas said she had been inside.
*  There are a huge network of tunnels underneath.
*  It looks like a spider web.
*  Entrances to the subterranean passageways can also be hidden within residential infrastructure.
*  Experts say as the war continues, any mission to target the tunnels also brings risks to
*  civilians.
