# China’s Zhurong vs. NASA’s Perseverance Rover Tech in Mars Space Race  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [May 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY)
*  This is NASA's Perseverance Rover.
*  And this is China's Zhurong Rover,
*  named after the Chinese god of fire.
*  And these two vehicles are on a mission to explore Mars.
*  The U.S. and China are clearly in a political competition here on Earth.
*  So it should not be surprising that it has now also become part of the space aspect.
*  One-three seconds.
*  The U.S. is the global leader with more than 50 years of Mars research.
*  About 20 meters off the surface.
*  And last February, Perseverance was NASA's fifth rover to land there.
*  China is the newcomer with a Mars program that started in 2006,
*  but the country has big plans for its first mission called Tianwen-1.
*  The fact that Tianwen-1 is an orbiter, lander and rover all in one
*  is a very gutsy move for a first mission.
*  This ambition makes the Zhurong Rover different from NASA's Perseverance.
*  So here's what these two vehicles are carrying and what they can tell us
*  about the new space race between both superpowers.
*  Since this is China's first attempt to touch down on Mars,
*  a major goal is to make sure its rover actually lands in one piece.
*  And it's expected to happen sometime in May.
*  Landing on Mars is very difficult.
*  Jonathan McDowell is an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,
*  and he's been studying space programs around the world for over 40 years.
*  It's harder than landing on Earth from space because the atmosphere is thinner,
*  so parachutes don't work as well.
*  And it's harder than landing on the moon. You can't just use the rocket engines.
*  So the Chinese lander that will release the Zhurong Rover has an intermediate solution,
*  using parachutes and rocket thrusters to slow down for a softer landing.
*  You want to go somewhere that you maximize your chances of a successful mission
*  because there's already so many things that can go wrong.
*  So China has chosen a relatively easy place for touchdown,
*  a basin in the northern hemisphere known as Utopia Planitia.
*  It's where NASA landed its second Mars lander, the Viking 2, in 1976.
*  It doesn't have a lot of big mountains or big canyons or cliffs that the rover might fall off.
*  And so it's a good first place to try and explore.
*  Since this is old terrain for NASA, Perseverance landed in a different area called the Jezero Crater.
*  So Perseverance has landed at the edge of an old river delta.
*  So you have this landscape which is a mixture of craters and mountains that are gentle rolling hills.
*  It's a tougher landing area compared with Utopia Planitia,
*  but Perseverance is equipped with a more advanced landing system called Skycrane.
*  I'm about to conduct a Skycrane maneuver.
*  So it helped the rover hover above ground while a computer vision system scanned for obstacles.
*  These two different types of terrains mean both countries have packed their rovers with different scientific goals in mind.
*  And one of China's main focuses is getting familiar with the new planet.
*  It has a pretty standard set of instruments that will help Chinese scientists understand what it's like to operate at Mars.
*  China is bringing better tech to Utopia Planitia than what NASA did decades ago.
*  The technology on the Zhurong rover is probably similar to what was on the Spirit and Opportunity rovers that NASA flew a few years ago.
*  And it's still fairly modern tech.
*  So this is Zhurong's multispectral camera, which can take pictures in different colored filters to study various rocks on Mars' surface.
*  There's also a penetrating radar that emits radio waves.
*  And when pointed at the surface, the rover can pick up signals and collect data about what's underneath, particularly water ice.
*  Like Zhurong, Perseverance is also surveying Mars, but it's larger in size.
*  So NASA has equipped it with more tools, like a helicopter called Ingenuity that could one day help explore the planet on a bigger scale.
*  It's the first object to make a controlled flight in the atmosphere of another planet, which is quite an engineering challenge.
*  One of the main goals is to learn about life on the Red Planet.
*  And scientists say the best way to do this is bringing back samples to Earth.
*  So Perseverance has a robotic arm that can drill into the surface, extract rocks, or collect loose soil.
*  The samples are then put in clean tubes to prevent contamination.
*  And then these are stored here, inside the rover's tummy.
*  NASA plans to bring back the samples to Earth by 2031 in a joint mission with the European Space Agency.
*  Even though in some respects the U.S. space technology is still the most advanced, the missions that China is executing are actually very impressive now.
*  So they've been catching up very quickly.
*  China's space program has enjoyed support from the absolute top leadership since the very beginning, dating back to Mao Zedong.
*  Dean Chang is a research fellow at the Washington-based think tank, the Heritage Foundation, and he's been watching China's space program for more than 20 years.
*  He says the country's political system is an advantage when it comes to planning ambitious projects like going to Mars.
*  Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party doesn't face regular elections.
*  So China is able to make longer-term decisions and, as important, sustain those decisions.
*  And those decisions are financially sustained.
*  So while there's little public information about China's space budget, Chang says it's likely not a small amount.
*  China doesn't provide those numbers.
*  But what we do know is, for example, China has four space launch facilities. That's more than any other country.
*  China's state-funded program makes it fundamentally different to how NASA works.
*  So the U.S., for example, has talked about going back to the moon for at least 20 years.
*  But with each Congress and with each president, priorities change. Funding, therefore, changes.
*  For instance, NASA's annual budget hasn't hit its peak from the 1960s, fluctuating more or less over the years.
*  And in contrast to China, NASA is an open civilian agency.
*  It has shared its technology and fostered a commercial space industry,
*  which has taken over many of NASA's launch tasks and helped with space exploration.
*  So if the Zhurong rover lands and operates on Mars, that means China will have done more and faster in less time than the U.S.
*  This success wouldn't be just a point of national pride,
*  but would also get the country closer to accomplishing other space goals,
*  including building a moon base and its own international space station.
*  China is presenting itself as an alternative.
*  With regards to the moon and Mars, most of that is for political signaling, political demonstrations,
*  to show the world who has a more capable technological base and a better political system.
