# Videos Show Hamas Trained for Oct. 7 Attack in Plain Sight for Years | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4)
*  The Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th seemed to come out of nowhere.
*  But in reality, Palestinian militants can be seen preparing for it in plain sight in training
*  videos like these for years.
*  These videos, which were widely posted to social media, look nearly identical to the
*  attacks on the 7th that killed more than 1,200 Israelis.
*  Last December of 2020, a loose coalition of Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas,
*  called the Joint Room, posted videos to Telegram of their annual training exercises.
*  The journal reviewed hundreds of posts and had military experts analyze them.
*  They show participants blowing up border fences, raiding military bases, taking hostages, and
*  traveling in convoys of white pickup trucks.
*  These annual training sessions took place every December at outdoor locations throughout
*  Gaza.
*  One location is less than two miles away from the era's border crossing, one of the Israeli
*  bases militants attacked on October 7th.
*  Arab, Israeli, and Western media even covered the training events.
*  By 2023, Joint Room militants appear to be more sophisticated in their tactics, and their
*  annual event was moved up to mid-September, a change from previous years.
*  Still, Israeli officials seem to have ignored or missed these warnings that mirror the tactics
*  Hamas would use just a few weeks later.
*  Perhaps the most sophisticated aspect of the October 7th attacks was Hamas' ability to
*  breach the Israeli border fence.
*  It's a tactic they had been honing for years and flaunting on social media.
*  In 2020 training footage posted to Telegram, we see members of the Joint Room coalition
*  using remote devices to blow up buildings.
*  In the following years, they practiced this same skill, now with gates and concrete barriers
*  like those seen on October 7th.
*  Once militants broke through the border on October 7th, they invaded a number of bases
*  belonging to Israeli Defense Forces, or the IDF.
*  Joint Room training footage shows Hamas and other Palestinian militants went to great
*  lengths to perfect this tactic.
*  They created mock IDF bases that featured watchtowers, domes, and gates, exactly like
*  those seen in the structures militants attacked in early October.
*  In footage from the 7th, we can see a militant throw an explosive into an IDF base along
*  the border.
*  We see them practice a similar maneuver in dozens of training videos since 2020.
*  On October 7th, militants divided into teams, taking cover like this as they seized bases.
*  It's another tactic they drilled over several years.
*  Members who watch this footage say that from 2020 to 2023, training participants gradually
*  look more coordinated, evolving into SWAT-like teams that move and shoot like military infantry,
*  much like we saw on October 7th.
*  As the attack unfolded on the 7th, militants took more than 200 Israeli civilians and IDF
*  soldiers hostage.
*  Here, at the 2020 Joint Room event, participants simulate seizing an Israeli soldier from a
*  tank.
*  The same tactic is repeated in 2021 exercises.
*  And by 2022, it evolves into a group hostage-taking scenario.
*  A recurring image through the events of October 7th is the highly organized convoys of white
*  pickup trucks that Hamas and other militants used to carry out the attacks.
*  In a training video shared on Telegram in September 2023, just weeks before the attack,
*  the same white pickup trucks full of Hamas militants can be seen pulling into the 2023
*  training site.
*  This September 10th Telegram post describes Joint Room leadership touring observation
*  points along the border wall.
*  The same pickup trucks are seen shuttling the entourage in photos of the inspection.
*  When asked whether Israel took any measures to guard against the tactics seen in these
*  videos and posts, the IDF said it is focused on eliminating the threat from Hamas and will
*  look into such questions at a later stage.
*  Despite these examples and the warnings they may have offered, Israeli officials failed
*  to ward off what led to the deadliest attacks in the country's history.
