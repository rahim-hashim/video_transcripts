# Alexei Navalny, One of the Kremlinâ€™s Most Vocal Critics, Has Died | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guS87gDs5vg)
*  Alexei Navalny, Russia's leading opposition figure, has died at age 47 while serving a
*  sentence of more than 30 years on multiple charges.
*  The anti-corruption activist was one of the Kremlin's most vocal critics.
*  Despite being barred from challenging President Vladimir Putin at the ballot box, he galvanised
*  Russia's political opposition.
*  Navalny's death comes after Putin announced that he planned to run for re-election in 2024,
*  a move that could keep him in power until at least 2030.
*  Navalny broke onto the Russian political scene in 2012,
*  becoming a key leader of a broad protest movement against the Kremlin
*  and Putin's decision to return to the presidency after serving four years as Prime Minister.
*  Those protests failed and so in the years that followed, Navalny focused on his anti-corruption
*  foundation, which carried out investigations into the pro-Kremlin elite.
*  His YouTube videos, usually detailing the corruption of Russia's elite,
*  set him apart from other opposition figures and gave him a platform to reach and mobilise
*  Russians across the country.
*  This earned him a number of enemies and Russian authorities branded his foundation
*  as an extremist group.
*  Navalny was arrested several times, including for alleged embezzlement, charges he denied.
*  His convictions thwarted his plans to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential elections,
*  making him unable to run.
*  In 2020, he led a campaign against a series of constitutional amendments,
*  including a provision to allow Putin to rule until 2036,
*  the same year Navalny fell ill on board a flight to Moscow.
*  He was evacuated to Germany where scientists said he had been poisoned by the nerve agent Novichok.
*  Navalny and his supporters blamed Russian authorities for the attack
*  and the US formally accused the Kremlin of carrying out an assassination attempt.
*  Russian authorities have rejected the accusations.
*  Navalny returned to Russia in 2021 and was detained upon his arrival
*  for what the Russian Federal Prison Service said were repeated violations of his probation.
*  He would never leave custody again.
*  In prison, Navalny complained about poor treatment and staged hunger strikes.
*  Despite being locked up, Navalny continued to be a vocal critic of the Kremlin.
*  At the end of 2023, Navalny's aides and lawyers said they had lost contact with the jailed
*  politician, stirring up concerns for his wellbeing.
*  He surfaced almost three weeks later after being transferred to a prison colony
*  known as the Polar Wolf, located in a remote Arctic region of Russia.
*  Navalny's allies said the move was designed to try to silence him.
