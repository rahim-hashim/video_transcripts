# High-Stakes Arctic Race Heats Up for U.S., Russia and China  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [August 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc)
*  This map shows the amount of ice around the North Pole decreasing rapidly over the years.
*  And as the sea ice steadily melts in the Arctic, the U.S., China and Russia are stepping up their game in the remote and inhospitable region
*  that's rich in resources and growing in strategic importance.
*  The Arctic is the most important region.
*  There are other people coming into the Arctic and we don't like it.
*  China is a close-knit country.
*  It's an untapped area of mineral resources that China would like to explore one day.
*  Russia has moved quite quickly in the last few years to really boost its military presence in the Arctic.
*  Greenland allows for trans-navigation from Europe to the United States.
*  It provides a place where you can refuel ships, refuel planes, have storage bases.
*  An estimated trillion dollars' worth of rare earth metals could be lying under all that ice,
*  as well as about 30% of the world's undiscovered gas and 13% of the world's undiscovered oil.
*  The warmer Arctic is also extending the season when ships can navigate in these usually ice-covered waters,
*  potentially reducing navigation time between Shanghai and New York by as much as seven days
*  and making tourism and cargo shipment more attractive.
*  All this is setting the stage for potential clashes.
*  Almost 10% of Russia's GDP and 20% of its exports come from north of the Arctic Circle,
*  and Moscow says it's ready to defend its territory.
*  The military infrastructure has really been successfully increased in the last several years.
*  One of Russia's most northern banks can now handle jet fighters,
*  and that's a huge jump from where it was a couple of years ago.
*  And this activity hasn't gone unnoticed in Washington.
*  Russia is unique.
*  Its actions deserve special attention.
*  Any signs that Russia is trying to reclaim its status as a great power on the global stage,
*  and especially in a place like the Arctic, which has disputes,
*  it's a cause for worry in Washington, I think largely because of that lack of trust.
*  Russia is also investing to renovate old Soviet ports along its northern sea route.
*  Cargo shipments, mainly of energy resources, are steadily growing.
*  But with little infrastructure and given the still limited period of time between July and November
*  that the route in the Arctic is open, there is still a long way before it becomes a real rival
*  to traditional shipping routes like via the Suez Canal.
*  Right now there's a relatively large gap between what Russia wants to accomplish in the Arctic
*  and what it is actually doing.
*  One of the biggest problems right now is infrastructure.
*  So it wants to attract international investors, and that includes China.
*  We are considering the possibility of building this northern sea route and the Chinese sea Silk Road.
*  In 2018, China declared itself a near-Arctic state,
*  even though the northernmost part of China is more than 900 miles away from the Arctic Circle.
*  Basically, China plans to carve out shipping routes and tap natural resources.
*  When China announced its polar strategy, Russia at least verbally welcomed it,
*  but there are still a lot of reservations.
*  Western capital and technology in the country dried up following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
*  So Moscow has accepted billions of dollars from Beijing in loans and investments,
*  including for the landmark gas project on the Yamal Peninsula.
*  But China's investments are mostly limited to projects that can help it exploit resources.
*  China doesn't want to just invest for the sake of investing.
*  It wants to actually see a profit come from that.
*  There's another sticking point between Russia and China and the Arctic.
*  Russia would want its own icebreakers to accompany commercial vessels.
*  China, on the other hand, would like freedom of navigation
*  and where China wouldn't need to rely on Russian exports.
*  And so that's the fundamental disagreement.
*  Essentially, it's a large real estate deal.
*  A lot of things could be done.
*  Most of the world woke up to the U.S. interest in the Arctic when President Trump
*  floated the idea of buying Greenland.
*  The biggest island in the region and which is the site of America's northernmost military base.
*  Denmark, which exercises control over Greenland, turned down the idea.
*  So after a decades-long hiatus, the U.S. reopened its consulate in Greenland's capital in June.
*  During an interview with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation,
*  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted that the U.S. is playing catch-up.
*  Are you a bit late to the party in the Arctic?
*  Yep, we're a little late.
*  Yeah, but that's alright.
*  I've been late to parties before and had a great time.
*  We'll succeed.
*  The United States, for instance, has a presence in the Arctic with a newly launched Navy fleet.
*  That's just a continuation of making sure that other great powers know that the U.S.
*  isn't losing a step and is able to fight in extreme cold weather battlefields.
*  We've all been a little bit naive to watch not only the Russians, but the Chinese interests there
*  continue to become more and more aggressive.
*  China and Russia insist that they support peaceful economic and scientific cooperation in the region.
*  Meanwhile, Washington is trying to build up its fleet of icebreakers.
*  We have under construction right now the largest icebreaker in the world.
*  And we're going to be trying to get, if we can, an extra 10 icebreakers.
*  At the moment, the U.S. has only one old heavy icebreaker in operation,
*  compared with Russia's some 40 vessels, including nuclear ones,
*  that can smash through ice nine feet thick.
*  China has two icebreakers as well, and it's building a nuclear one.
*  Icebreakers do a number of things for a country that has them.
*  One, it keeps open commercial ice channels and allows for the rescue of vessels.
*  If the U.S. is unable to send up a rescue team, other great powers like Russia and even China
*  can go up there, save people, then they'll have a better claim to be able to stay in the Arctic.
*  For the U.S., China and Russia, it's a pivotal moment in the Arctic.
*  The moves they make today are likely to define the region for years to come
*  and potentially help reshape global supply chains and energy markets.
