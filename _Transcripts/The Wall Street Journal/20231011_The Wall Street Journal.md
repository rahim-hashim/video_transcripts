# Israel Launches New Airstrikes on Gaza as Blinken Heads to Region | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcF9FqwWTbg)
*  Dozens of Israeli airstrikes pounded Gaza into Wednesday, destroying homes, hospitals and schools.
*  Palestinian authorities said more than 1,000 people have been killed since Saturday.
*  Israel said it had regained full control of communities in southern Israel on Tuesday,
*  after killing hundreds of Hamas fighters who had crossed the border from Gaza.
*  Rescue workers began to recover the bodies of civilians killed in the assault,
*  as Israeli authorities updated the death toll to 1,200.
*  As Israeli soldiers positioned themselves for a potential ground invasion of Gaza,
*  the US said it would increase military supplies to Israel
*  and warned other militant groups against joining the fight.
*  President Biden condemned Hamas' cross-border attack
*  as the first American plane carrying advanced weaponry landed in southern Israel.
*  You know there are moments in this life,
*  I mean this literally, when the pure unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world.
*  So in this moment, we must be crystal clear, we stand with Israel.
*  We will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens,
*  defend itself and respond to this attack.
*  Israeli troops searched through the wreckage of the Kfar Azhar Qubut on Tuesday,
*  after regaining control of the area from Hamas fighters.
*  Israeli defense forces fought militants in the Qubut for three days
*  after militants overran the community on Saturday.
*  It's not a war, it's not a battlefield, it's a war that we have to fight.
*  It's a massacre, it's a terror activity.
*  Soldiers searched through burnt-out houses
*  to recover the remains of Israeli civilians killed in the assault.
*  In a phone call with President Biden,
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared the Hamas attack to ISIS.
*  Joe, I want to give you a clear picture of the difficult situation we face.
*  We were struck Saturday by an attack whose savagery,
*  I could say, we have not seen since the Holocaust.
*  I mean, we had hundreds massacred, families wiped out in their beds and their homes,
*  women brutally raped and murdered, over 100 kidnapped, including children.
*  Thousands of Israeli troops continued to sweep through southern Israel
*  looking for any Hamas fighters still hiding in the area.
*  Over 100,000 Israeli reservists amassed around the Gaza border
*  in preparation for a potential ground invasion.
*  On a visit to troops in the south,
*  Israel's defence minister said combat operations would soon intensify.
*  We started the attack, the air, and continued with the attack.
*  That's it.
*  The United Nations said Israel reportedly struck some residential buildings in Gaza
*  without warning residents to evacuate.
*  So far, over a quarter million people have fled from their homes.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to arrive in Israel Thursday
*  to discuss how the U.S. can provide additional support.
*  I'm also very engaged with partners throughout the region,
*  as well as, of course, looking out for American citizens,
*  families who have had loved ones killed or have loved ones missing.
*  Thank you.
