# How NASA Satellites Can Help Predict Volcanic Eruptions and Limit Damage  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [May 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ)
*  Volcanic eruptions like this may look mesmerizing, and sometimes attract flocks of tourists.
*  But they're also dangerous events that impact human activities, displace people, and cost
*  lives.
*  The prediction is that we will lose some 50% of our GDP as a result of the volcanic eruption.
*  Take this volcano on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent.
*  No deaths were reported, but many people had to evacuate and ash-blanketed entire neighborhoods.
*  For this Icelandic volcano that erupted in 2010, paralyzing air traffic and costing nearly
*  $5 billion to global GDP.
*  So far, tools like seismicity monitors have allowed volcanologists to forecast unrest
*  days or weeks in advance.
*  But now, NASA scientists say they can help forecast eruptions months or even years ahead
*  of time, using satellite imagery and monitoring changes in ground temperature.
*  We wanted to understand to what extent the heat released by volcanoes can be used to
*  detect when volcanoes start to reactivate.
*  There are many impacts of volcanic eruptions, and our goal is to minimize those impacts
*  as much as possible.
*  So here's how it works, and how scientists say we could benefit from this new research.
*  An early sign of a volcanic eruption is heat, as magma underground rises, bringing warm
*  gases to the surface.
*  We see that these heat emissions start to appear for several months to years before
*  eruptions, and we observe these signals prior to the changes that we observe with other
*  types of signals.
*  The problem is that these heat emissions can be hard to monitor on the ground, so Girona
*  and his team turn to the sky.
*  NASA satellites have already been recording years of information on thermal activity.
*  In fact, none of these satellites have been designed specifically to explore volcanoes.
*  We can still use that information for monitoring volcanic eruptions.
*  After looking at two decades of radiant heat data for several volcanoes, the researchers
*  found a pattern.
*  In the years leading up to an eruption, temperatures increased over much of each volcano, before
*  dropping again after the eruption.
*  We are detecting the early reactivation of the volcano, which is crucial to improve the
*  monitoring efforts.
*  But before this technology can be fully deployed in the real world, scientists will have to
*  process much more data.
*  Hopefully in a few years we can have a better understanding of these signals, better understanding
*  of volcanoes, and we can provide accurate forecasts.
*  With about 1,500 active volcanoes on Earth and troves of satellite data for each one
*  of them, the NASA team is seeking help from algorithms and other researchers around the
*  world.
*  This is another tool in our toolbox.
*  That's Mike Poland.
*  He's a geophysicist for the US Geological Survey.
*  He says that these satellite images will have to be used in tandem with other traditional
*  methods.
*  If you're building a house, you don't just show up with a screwdriver.
*  You've got a screwdriver, a hammer, a saw.
*  We need a diverse toolkit so that we can recognize all the different types of signs that volcanoes
*  might be giving us.
*  Seismometers, gas sensors and radar sensors are some of the tools that volcanologists
*  will continue to use.
*  Giving communities more time to prepare could make the difference between saving livelihoods
*  or not.
*  In St. Vincent, the local observatory noticed signs of unrest weeks in advance, and officials
*  were ready to evacuate 20,000 residents before the volcano erupted, helping to avoid casualties
*  and greater damage.
*  But with even more warning, officials say they may have been able to avoid damage such
*  as water contamination, for example.
*  When the massive eruption took place, it compromised our entire water supply.
*  All of our reservoirs were contaminated with ash.
*  We were without water for a couple of days.
*  And perhaps going forward we can look at putting in tanks where persons can store water properly.
*  We have to look at greater mitigation where natural disasters are concerned.
*  And in the case of that Icelandic volcano, scientists say that more warning would have
*  given the aviation industry more time to adapt and find alternative routes.
*  It's important to forecast eruptions because we can reduce the impact at a local scale,
*  but also at a global scale if we are talking about much larger eruptions.
