# WSJ Correspondent Shelters From Rocket Attack in Southern Israel | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI)
*  We went into one of the towns on the border, it's about a half mile from the Gaza Strip
*  border called Sderot.
*  We went into the town and the Israeli military told us that everything was fine and about
*  10 minutes later Hamas rocket attack slammed into the city.
*  We ran for cover.
*  You're so close to the Gaza border there you really only have a few seconds before the
*  rockets hit.
*  Israel's famed Iron Dome defense system did not work to hit all the rockets and so we
*  had a rocket hit.
*  It destroyed a car a few blocks away.
*  Pretty jarring experience.
*  Fortunately nobody was injured.
*  We got a chance to look around the town and the aftermath was remarkable.
*  The Israeli military had an operation they'd actually had to destroy the city's police
*  station with a bulldozer to get out Hamas militants from there.
*  We saw one of the ATVs that one of the Hamas militants had used for the attack covered
*  in blood, coated in blood with flies on it.
*  We saw the destroyed cars, cars that had been a set ablaze with people inside of it.
*  You could see the remnants of people inside.
*  It's quite intense down here to be honest it's a full on war zone.
*  We also talked to soldiers that are on the border here preparing for a potential offensive
*  in Gaza.
*  There are dozens and dozens of tanks digging in for the fight.
*  We talked to soldiers that are ready to go in as soon as they get the order.
*  This will probably be the largest ground offensive that they've launched there and they have
*  called up tens of thousands of reservists.
*  You're starting to see them converging on there.
*  I think they still need time to prepare the forces and get people in place.
