# Israel Demands Mass Evacuation in Gaza as Invasion Looms | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFYrllh7sAY)
*  Israel dropped leaflets over northern Gaza Friday, issuing a demand for over one million residents there to evacuate immediately.
*  The United Nations called for Israel to rescind the order, saying it could transform an already tragic situation into a catastrophe.
*  Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have already triggered a mass displacement and killed more than 1,500 Palestinians since Saturday.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Jordan,
*  while Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Tel Aviv, as fears of a humanitarian disaster and wider regional conflict mount.
*  Most of Gaza's population has no power after Israel ordered supplies to be cut off as part of a total siege on the enclave.
*  Hospitals in Gaza warned that fuel could run out in a matter of days.
*  Aid agencies also warned that food and water supplies in Gaza are running out.
*  Ahead of a possible ground invasion, thousands of troops and armoured vehicles have massed near the border with Gaza.
*  Israel gave the clearest indication so far of its war aims on Thursday,
*  with the military saying it plans to capture or kill all of Hamas's leaders.
*  We will reach a situation where those who will lead Gaza will be severely punished.
*  And those who will remain there will understand better that such a thing is not done for the State of Israel.
