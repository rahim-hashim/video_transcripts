# How Israelâ€™s Iron Dome Works | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I)
*  Beginning on Saturday, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an estimated 3,500 rockets
*  from Gaza into Israel, according to the Israeli military.
*  As Israelis sought shelter, they had an added layer of protection.
*  Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, a land-based system that intercepts and destroys
*  short-range rockets and mortars.
*  It has become a bedrock of the country's defense since its introduction in 2011.
*  Israeli military said the Iron Dome is currently operating at the same capacity as previous
*  rounds, with a 90% success rate.
*  Here's how the complex detection and interception system works.
*  The system is powered by missile defense batteries, each consisting of three main components.
*  These batteries can defend against short-range rocket and mortar attacks within almost 45
*  miles of the battery.
*  They're also mobile, so they can be moved to where they are needed.
*  First, a radar unit detects an incoming rocket and relays information about its speed and
*  trajectory to the battery's control center.
*  The control center's computers calculate if the rocket is going to hit populated areas.
*  If it is, a missile is fired from the launcher.
*  Each launcher contains 20 interceptor missiles.
*  Each receives constant guidance updates from the control center and its internal radar.
*  The missile destroys the incoming rocket by exploding near it.
*  The goal is to do this far away from populated areas, minimizing damage on the ground.
*  As of 2021, the defense system had intercepted over 2,400 rockets bound for civilian areas
*  since its launch in 2011, according to an Israeli military spokesperson.
*  During a conflict in 2012, the Iron Dome knocked down 421 rockets launched from Gaza and bound
*  for Israeli cities before a November ceasefire.
*  And during the 2014 war in Gaza, it intercepted 700 rockets fired by Hamas, effectively blunting
*  the group's aerial effect.
*  The United States has provided over a billion dollars in funding for the system, and has
*  also bought and is testing two Iron Dome batteries of its own.
*  In 2021, concerned about the possibility of attacks from China, U.S. forces began testing
*  a version of the Dome in Guam.
*  Israel has expanded the defense system by installing missile batteries on ships.
*  Earlier this year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told The Wall Street Journal that
*  he wouldn't support sending the system to Ukraine to defend against Russian attacks.
*  We're concerned also with the possibility that systems that we would give to Ukraine
*  would fall into Iranian hands and could be reverse engineered.
*  And we would find ourselves facing Israeli systems used against Israel.
