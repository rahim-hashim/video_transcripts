# While Missiles Fly, Flights Land: How Israelâ€™s Airport Stays Open | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0t67OqyzL4)
*  The morning of October 9th.
*  Fragments of a Hamas missile land less than a mile outside of Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's
*  main international airport.
*  On the ground, passengers ran for cover.
*  In the skies above, a Ryanair flight on approach diverted away.
*  And yet in a matter of minutes, aircraft resumed taking off and landing at the airport, while
*  the war continued.
*  Despite it being less than 40 miles from the front lines of Israel's war with Gaza, Ben
*  Gurion Airport has remained open throughout the conflict.
*  And while civil airspaces above war zones, like Ukraine, often remain closed from the
*  moment war breaks out, Israel's civil airspace has continued to receive commercial traffic.
*  I think the key question here that everyone's asking is why haven't the Israelis closed
*  their airspace?
*  And I think the answer is countries are always going to err on the side of keeping it open.
*  So how does Israel keep an airport open in a war zone?
*  And what are the risks to aircraft in the airspace?
*  Keeping airspace open can provide a vital corridor for Israel to allow people to leave,
*  soldiers to return and goods and supplies to continue entering the country during the
*  conflict.
*  One of the steps the country has taken to try and protect those aircraft is to change
*  the route they're approaching Ben Gurion from.
*  The main mitigation measure that we're taking is completely separating the routes from the
*  area of the conflict.
*  The routes basically in and out of Israel are much northern than they are usually, going
*  10 miles south of Haifa.
*  According to Israel's Civil Aviation Authority, the country's civil and military air traffic
*  controllers also work very closely together and often sit in the same buildings and look
*  at the same aerial picture.
*  And that allows them to coordinate on trying to ensure that missiles from the country's
*  Iron Dome system don't impact civilian aircraft when they're intercepting Hamas missiles.
*  It still leaves plenty of flexibility for the defense systems to plan their engagement,
*  to plan the interception of a rocket.
*  On the ground, while Ben Gurion Airport can normally have over 10 aircraft waiting at
*  its gates.
*  We've limited the number of aircraft that are loaded with passengers and with fuel.
*  So you would see maximum six, normally four.
*  And when the aircraft are ready to depart, takeoff is as swift as possible, with no queuing
*  on the runway.
*  Israel's Civil Aviation Authority says that part of the reason it's able to keep its
*  airspace open is because it has remained open previously through years of Hamas missile
*  attacks.
*  So no one is doing anything new.
*  Civil aviation doesn't like doing new stuff, not in general and specifically not in conflict.
*  And that's why the country issued a notice to airlines saying its airspace would remain
*  open, but that airlines should use caution.
*  A notice the FAA and IASA, its European equivalent, have also sent out.
*  Yet despite this, the vast bulk of international carriers have paused flying to Tel Aviv.
*  While many airlines stopped flying to Tel Aviv the day Hamas launched its surprise attack,
*  others continued to fly for a few days more.
*  A British Airways flight actually turned back moments before landing as air raid sirens
*  were sounding in the area surrounding the airport.
*  British Airways has issued a statement saying it's suspended all flights to Tel Aviv until
*  further notice.
*  Some owners, even though their insurance allows these operations, they don't want it.
*  Again, understandable.
*  Even though the airspace remains open, airlines will have many questions to consider if they
*  operate flights into the region.
*  How frequent is the rocket fire from Gaza?
*  How deep into Israel are rockets being launched?
*  Where are those Iron Dome intercepts taking place?
*  Matt Bori is chief intelligence officer and one of the co-founders of Osprey Flight Solutions,
*  an aviation risk management company that advises the likes of America's TSA.
*  His job is to evaluate some of the worst case scenarios and he thinks that Israel's airspace
*  should be more restricted.
*  The area where the conflict is affecting, which includes northern Israel, Haifa, Tel
*  Aviv, should be paused until the trajectory of this conflict becomes more clear.
*  Matt cautioned that even though aircraft were being rerouted to approach over Haifa, there
*  had still been recent surface-to-air missile or SAM activity in the region.
*  The IDF has confirmed they employed a conventional SAM system to shoot down a rocket launched
*  from Gaza near Haifa.
*  Footage of the impact later appeared on social media.
*  Why this is a concern is because now we're creating the conditions for a shoot down.
*  Civil aviation flying in between areas where conflict activity is happening.
*  Israel says that when a missile is fired, its air traffic controllers can have over
*  a minute and a half to maneuver aircraft out of the area.
*  And in that time aircraft can cover around 10 miles.
*  While neither Hamas nor Israel is likely to intentionally target civilian aircraft, according
*  to Matt there's still a risk that an aircraft could be shot down if it's misidentified
*  as a missile or other threat.
*  Which is exactly what happened when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern
*  Ukraine by pro-Russia militia.
*  Weather caused this aircraft to deviate from its flight path, which led to the rebel group
*  to interpret it as not a civilian airliner because it wasn't flying on the civilian
*  airliner routes.
*  So Osprey has already told its clients that we assess the potential for miscalculation
*  or misidentification in Israeli airspace to be likely in the near term under the current
*  scenario.
*  Israel denies that misidentification is a major risk factor in its airspace.
*  There are technical limitations on some of the systems that again there is no possibility
*  that an interceptor could target a civilian aircraft.
*  If anyone has a minimal knowledge in aviation, a screen showing a drone and a civilian aircraft
*  and a fighter jet looks very, very different.
*  And the MH17 and other tragic accidents that happened have a very, very different background
*  and none of it is relevant in this conflict.
*  While the situation in Israel is already complex, the addition of outside forces like Syria
*  and Hezbollah who have already engaged in limited artillery exchanges with Israel could
*  complicate things further.
*  Do you trust Hezbollah will not make a mistake on firing on a target over northern Israel?
*  Israel, however, says that it is monitoring risks from all sides.
*  We're monitoring very, very closely and looking at the risk very carefully, monitoring the
*  situation in Lebanon, monitoring the situation in Syria.
*  I can assure you that if we see many rockets launch towards Ben Gurion, we will freeze
*  traffic and Ben Gurion and traffic will go to Elat Ramon.
*  As the situation in the skies above Israel evolves, its aviation authority maintains
*  that it will remain accountable, whatever happens.
*  We monitor the situation closely.
*  We listen to intel.
*  We see ourselves as accountable and we look at this role very, very seriously.
