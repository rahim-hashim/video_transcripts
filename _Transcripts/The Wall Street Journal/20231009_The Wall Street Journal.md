# Iran Supported Hamas in Attack Against Israel | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo)
*  The Gaza National Bank was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike on Sunday as fighting continues
*  in Israel and Gaza.
*  More than 700 Israelis have been confirmed dead, and 560 Palestinians have been killed
*  after Hamas, a militant group from Gaza, launched an unprecedented attack on Israel over the
*  weekend.
*  Hamas worked with Iranian security officials to plan the attack, according to senior members
*  of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iran-backed militant group.
*  Western leaders have denounced Saturday's assault and offered support to Israel.
*  I've just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to assure him of the UK's steadfast support
*  as Israel defends itself against these appalling attacks.
*  Iranian security officials helped Hamas plan the surprise attack on Israel, senior members
*  of Hamas and Hezbollah said.
*  The green light for the attack, which included air, land and sea incursions, was given at
*  a meeting in Beirut last week.
*  A spokesman for Iran's mission to the UN said Iran stood in support of Gaza's actions,
*  but didn't direct them.
*  Hamas is considered a proxy group of Iran.
*  The exact nature of how much Hamas is being led by Iran has always been unclear.
*  But of course, they receive a lot of their funding from Iran, a lot of their training
*  from Iran, and a lot of their weapons from Iran.
*  That is according to Israeli officials here in Israel.
*  The planning for the operation began in August, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah.
*  The direct Iranian involvement could raise the risk of a broader conflict in the Middle
*  East.
*  U.S. officials say they haven't seen evidence of Tehran's involvement.
*  There's a long relationship between Iran and Hamas.
*  In fact, Hamas wouldn't be around in the way that it is without the support that it's
*  received from Iran over the years.
*  In this specific instance, we have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind
*  this particular attack, but there's certainly a long relationship.
*  On Sunday, more than 250 people were found dead at a music festival in Israel, according
*  to Israeli state broadcaster, Khan.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a general to coordinate search efforts
*  for captured and missing Israelis.
*  The mother of a missing woman described a phone call from her daughter during the attack.
*  At 10 o'clock, she called us and said, Mommy, we were robbed.
*  They shot at us.
*  The car was shot.
*  We cannot drive.
*  Everybody here is Israel.
*  There were four kids in the middle.
*  Kids, there were 23, 25, 30.
*  Everybody was shot.
*  They were bleeding.
*  Since the conflict began, world leaders have been speaking out, largely condemning the
*  attacks on Israel.
*  The United States said it would send additional military assistance to Israel, including equipment
*  and weaponry.
*  The US also plans to move a carrier strike group closer to Israel's shores and Air Force
*  jet fighter squadrons towards its skies.
*  A move that signals its support and aims to deter Iran from taking advantage of the uncertainty
*  in the region.
*  A Hamas spokesperson said the decision to deploy an aircraft carrier near Israel by
*  the US is participation in the aggression against our people.
*  The US is sending one of its largest aircraft carriers to the region.
*  And it's very clear who that's a message to.
*  It's not a message to Hamas.
*  It's not a message to Gaza.
*  That's very clear.
*  It's most likely, of course, they do not say this publicly, this is a message to Hezbollah
*  in Lebanon.
*  The biggest fear in Israel really is that Hezbollah, which is a militant group far stronger
*  than Hamas, has the means to really wreak havoc in Israel, that they could enter this
*  war any day.
*  Hezbollah is trying to deter Israel from invading Gaza, from creating a ground invasion into
*  Gaza.
*  And on the other hand, Israel and now the United States are trying to deter Hezbollah
*  from joining this war.
*  The Israeli military said that as many as 1,000 Hamas militants entered Israel from
*  Gaza over the weekend, many of whom were armed.
*  The Israeli military is preparing the ground in Gaza for an invasion, for a ground invasion.
*  They've cleared the communities around the Gaza border, not only because it's not safe
*  for them there, but in order to have freedom of operational movement in that area.
*  They have not declared that they will do it, but they are making very clear preparations
*  that they will do it.
*  If you listen here to the politicians here in Israel, many of them are talking about
*  removing Hamas entirely from the equation.
*  There's only one way to do that, and that's a ground assault.
*  That will take a very long time to do.
*  It will be a very difficult and bloody battle.
