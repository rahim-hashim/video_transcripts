# Israel Declares War On Hamas Following Unprecedented Wide-Scale Attack | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared war on Hamas after the Gaza-based
*  militant group launched an unprecedented surprise attack on Saturday.
*  We, the citizens of Israel, are at war.
*  Not in a strike, not in a war.
*  This morning, Hamas launched a deadly attack on the state of Israel and its citizens.
*  In what was the biggest attack on Israel in years, Palestinian militants launched a barrage
*  of more than 5,000 rockets in a coordinated attack by land, sea and air.
*  The Hamas military commander called the assault Operation Al-Aqsa Flood and urged Palestinians
*  everywhere to fight against Israeli occupation.
*  Rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip as far north as Tel Aviv.
*  Gunmen also entered the country from the south and a stunning infiltration of Israel's defences.
*  Hamas said it had taken over several Israeli villages in the country's south.
*  Gunfire could be heard echoing across the town of Sterot, which lies less than a mile
*  from the Gaza Strip.
*  Residents have been warned to stay inside while emergency responders activated amidst
*  the fighting.
*  I have been ordered to carry out a wide-ranging attack and to wage a fierce war with all
*  my might, which the enemy does not know.
*  The enemy will pay a price that it does not know.
*  I call on all citizens of Israel to listen to the command of the army and the commander
*  of the enemy.
*  We are at war and we will win.
*  Palestinian families across Gaza have begun fleeing their homes in fear of Israeli retaliation.
*  Israel's defence force is the Middle East's most formidable.
*  Made up of 169,000 active duty troops and 465,000 reservists, it is supplied with some
*  of the world's most advanced drones and weaponry.
*  The US provides Israel with $3.8 billion in annual military assistance.
*  Saturday's attack holds deep significance for Israel, as the country has just marked
*  50 years after the Yom Kippur War.
*  In that conflict in 1973, Egypt, Syria and other Arab countries launched a war on Israel
*  on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar.
*  I think right now Israelis are in a severe state of shock.
*  They almost don't have words because they're just so surprised by this.
*  I think that right now people are being called up to reserves all across the country.
*  Obviously there's been a lot of political turmoil in Israel.
*  There have been a number of military reservists who said that they would refuse to report
*  for duty because of this battle over the judiciary in Israel.
*  Everybody's put that aside now.
*  There's a mass protest movement that has called off all the protests and all the reservists
*  who originally had said that they wanted people to refuse to report for duty are now
*  urging everybody to report for duty.
*  So I think the country right now is just going into fight mode, survival mode, like real
*  survival mode.
*  And I think that people probably don't want to start pointing fingers, but very quickly
*  that will start happening.
*  And obviously the first finger will be pointed at the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  and we'll see where he goes from here.
*  In response, Israel's military launched airstrikes on what is said were Hamas targets in Gaza.
