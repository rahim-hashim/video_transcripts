# Kibbutz Survivor Recounts Hiding With Daughters as Husband Fought Hamas | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s)
*  I was born and raised in Kfar Aza.
*  It's a beautiful place.
*  There's grass, it's open, and good people.
*  Uri and I got married in 2007.
*  We have three daughters, Maya, Alona, and Yela, 13, 11, and 9.
*  Uri is a mechanical engineer.
*  We're good people.
*  We wanted peace.
*  We did everything for that.
*  We were always waiting for something to happen.
*  It's like something you feel in the air.
*  We had a routine already because we knew how to cope with this escalation.
*  It's okay.
*  We know it.
*  What we met on this Saturday, a terrible, horrific Saturday, was a horror movie.
*  It was something new.
*  At around half past six in the morning, we started hearing shooting.
*  We say, okay, it's an escalation.
*  Something's going on.
*  Fine, we'll go to the fortified rooms.
*  And Uri and our dog would sit there for just, I don't know, maybe it was one second.
*  And I sit with the girls and, okay, we know what to do.
*  We started hearing shooting.
*  We heard Arabic.
*  So I realized something different is happening.
*  And I know Uri realized the same.
*  He started getting messages saying, this is not a drill.
*  It's real.
*  He went to our bedroom, changed his shirt, took his personal weapon and left.
*  I'm not sure he put any shoes.
*  We hear the door close.
*  And the girls ask me, did dad go?
*  And I say, no, dad's not going without saying goodbye.
*  And I write him a message straight away, why did you go without saying goodbye?
*  But he left.
*  He rode on his bike straight to the weaponry to take another weapon.
*  And I stayed with the girls.
*  Were the girls in the fortified room?
*  Till that point, I thought maybe the army was around me taking care of us.
*  Maybe, I don't know.
*  But I realized they weren't.
*  So I think I realized something was very wrong because it wasn't answering my messages at
*  all.
*  All we hear is shooting, red code alerts, bombs going off.
*  Like, this is the soundtrack when we're in this room.
*  I didn't realize, I still didn't understand that they were killing all of us.
*  Everybody, they were contacting me to tell me what's going on, where is Uri?
*  Find Uri you need.
*  And the only thing I need is to find Uri, please find Uri.
*  I think around midnight, the army came.
*  They evacuated us.
*  We walked, ran, walked with the army.
*  It was night, so I can't say I saw a lot of bodies, but I saw some on the way to the
*  gas stations and I made sure the girls don't look.
*  I think a part of me knew.
*  I realized.
*  I realized he would call me, he would contact me.
*  We buried him next to where his parents live.
*  For me, I know Uri was a hero because I know I married a hero.
*  What we had on this Saturday is unacceptable.
*  Too many people died waiting to be rescued.
*  We're all going to have to live with that.
