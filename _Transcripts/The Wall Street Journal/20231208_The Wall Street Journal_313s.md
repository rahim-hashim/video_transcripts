# Here's What Life in Gaza Looks Like on Snapchat | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYevQ467lA8)
*  These videos, posted by civilians to the social media network Snapchat, provide a unique view
*  on what life is like for those trapped inside Gaza.
*  The conflict between Israel and Hamas has seen Israel's ground forces encircle the north
*  of the enclave and move into the south, while continuing to bombard the strip with airstrikes.
*  Snapchat has a special feature which displays public posts on a map showing the world where
*  each was recorded.
*  The Wall Street Journal has verified videos posted on the platform that document daily
*  life, show the scope of the destruction and highlight the limited options Gazans have
*  to remain safe.
*  Israel said its forces had completed encircling Gaza City on November 2nd.
*  During that time, these scenes show the outside of Al Quds Hospital.
*  In this footage, an injured person appears to be escorted into the facility.
*  And in a video posted days later, explosions and loud bangs.
*  Other Snapchat videos taken at night show incoming projectiles descending in the distance.
*  Next up the street from Al Quds Hospital, a video on the platform shows friends driving
*  in a car around the city.
*  The neighbourhood is filled with rubble and collapsed buildings.
*  Another video in this area, north of Gaza City, shows what was once a bustling street
*  damaged and this shopfront was destroyed.
*  As Israel continued its military campaign in the north of Gaza, clearing areas and searching
*  buildings, its army ordered people to travel to the south of the enclave.
*  A user who posted from Gaza City a week earlier documented his journey.
*  But even in parts of the south, videos posted on Snapchat showed explosions and loud bangs.
*  It all highlighted videos where people posted about life inside their makeshift homes.
*  Daily life in Gaza has been incredibly challenging following the October 7th attacks by Hamas,
*  which killed 1200 Israelis.
*  In response to the assault, Israel cut off all supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity.
*  On November 24th, Israel and Hamas agreed to a temporary ceasefire.
*  Although the bombardments stopped, users posted about how hard it was to access dwindling
*  supplies.
*  The situation in Gaza is not good, so I had to stay here since 8pm yesterday.
*  So tomorrow is the last day of the day.
*  And that's it.
*  I will try not to get to the last day.
*  God bless you.
*  Happy Friday.
*  So we can have lunch.
*  What else?
*  There is no life.
*  No corona.
*  Some Snapchat users posted about how they managed to keep their phones running.
*  We have been like this for 31 days.
*  All day we spend our lives on our phones and our phones so that we can light anything
*  at the end of the day.
*  God bless you.
*  May God keep you safe.
*  God bless you.
*  God bless you.
*  After the temporary ceasefire, fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas resumed on
*  December 1st.
*  More than 15,000 Palestinians, the majority women and children, have been killed since
*  October 7th.
*  The death toll from Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza doesn't distinguish between civilians
*  and citizens.
*  As Israel's ground operation presses on, Snapchat posts provide a rare window into how the
*  campaign has uprooted lives, destroyed entire neighbourhoods and created a massive humanitarian
*  crisis.
