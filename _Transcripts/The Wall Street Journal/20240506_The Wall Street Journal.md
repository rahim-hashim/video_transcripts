Video Description: Many pro-Palestinian student protesters are demanding schools drop Israel investments. The demands vary from school to school. 

At Columbia University, protesters are pressing for the sale of holdings tied to companies allegedly profiting from Israel’s actions like Google, Amazon and Airbnb. At Yale and Cornell, students have called for their schools to divest themselves of weapons manufacturers involved in Israel’s campaign. But how does divestment work at universities?

WSJ explores the history of divestment movements at schools and the challenges involved in modern divestment initiatives.

# Columbia Has Divested Before Here's What Happened  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU_2BIRp6vo)
*  Columbia's pro-Palestinian encampment triggered similar student protests across the country
*  and renewed calls for universities to divest themselves of investments in Israel and companies
*  profiting from the Israeli war in Gaza.
*  It's the most intense and contentious debate that I've seen over how university endowments
*  should be invested.
*  So what would divestment look like?
*  How realistic is it?
*  And what are the challenges involved?
*  What began at Columbia University on April 17th has swept college campuses across the
*  country.
*  What unites many students is their demand for divestment, which has its roots in a Palestinian
*  movement known as BDS, or Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.
*  Divestment, simply put, means selling off an investment or business interest, but in practice
*  it's more complicated.
*  To begin with, the demands vary from school to school.
*  At Yale and Cornell, students have called on the universities to stop investing in weapons
*  manufacturers directly involved in Israel's campaign.
*  By contrast, Columbia protesters are demanding the sale of holdings in funds and businesses
*  that activists say are profiting from Israel's invasion of Gaza.
*  These include Google and Amazon, which provide technology services to Israel's military.
*  Airbnb, because it allows rental listings in Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
*  And Caterpillar, whose tractors Israel's military uses.
*  The target of students' calls for divestment are university endowments.
*  In practical terms, the way divestment could work depends some on the endowment.
*  Larger endowments invest a really large share of their portfolio in private equity and hedge
*  funds.
*  For a big endowment, you might have to shift your investments from one private equity fund
*  to another if your private equity fund manager isn't prepared to follow the investment guidelines
*  that you've provided.
*  So far, universities have flatly refused to adjust their holdings in response to student
*  agitation.
*  On April 29, Columbia said it will not divest from Israel.
*  Other universities that have refused to divest from Israel include Yale, NYU, the University
*  of Michigan, and American University.
*  Calls for divestment have long been a feature of student protests.
*  But perhaps the best-known divestment campaign was during the 1970s and 80s, when activists
*  compelled universities to cut ties to South Africa, then under all-white rule.
*  In 1985, Columbia said it would sell $39 million of stock it held in companies including Coca-Cola,
*  Ford, and Mobil Oil.
*  Eventually, more than 150 universities divested themselves of companies doing business in
*  South Africa.
*  I think looking back at the South African divestment demands, the protesters draw a
*  couple lessons.
*  One is that they see that South African apartheid eventually did come to an end.
*  And whether that was because of direct economic pressure or a change in narrative and symbolic
*  isolation of South Africa, I think is probably less important to the protesters than whether
*  direct economic pressure led to that change.
*  I think the other consideration for looking back is that it was a very different economy.
*  Wall Street worked differently.
*  Those calling for divestment of investments in Israel say they are motivated by what they
*  see as a moral argument, that Israel is committing genocide and forcing Palestinians to live
*  under a form of apartheid.
*  Israel has strongly denied allegations of genocide and says its Gaza operations are
*  justified by its right of self-defense under international law.
*  More recently, colleges have heeded demands to dump holdings in private prisons and fossil
*  fuel companies.
*  And you can look at the University of California, which back in 2020 announced that it had fully
*  divested from fossil fuels.
*  Today, many university endowments are controlled by fund managers who widely follow a diversified
*  portfolio model.
*  They typically dedicate chunks of their portfolio to asset classes such as stocks, real estate
*  and private equity, including venture capital.
*  Ultimately, fund managers answer to the endowments trustees who have the final say on investment
*  decisions.
*  University endowments are like private equity and hedge funds because they're managed to
*  maximize returns at the end of the day.
*  Our endowments today are bigger than at any time in our history, and that means that universities
*  are connected to every corner of the global economy, but they're connected through Wall
*  Street.
*  Critics opposed to dropping Israel investments note that it could be difficult because of
*  the secretive nature of modern endowments.
*  Columbia, like many private schools, keeps most of its financial information obscure.
*  Its trustees do publish annual financial reports, but those reports don't detail specific investments.
*  Those funds that schools invest in, private equity and hedge funds, they value their secrecy
*  because what they're trying to do is beat the market.
*  They don't want their secret sauce to be out in front of the entire market and community.
*  Critics of divestment point out that universities' investments in Israeli-linked companies likely
*  represent only a small portion of an endowment's overall portfolio, meaning that the impact
*  of one university or even many universities selling their Israeli-linked assets could
*  be negligible.
*  A 1998 study found that voluntary divestment from South Africa had little discernible effect,
*  and that the boycott primarily reallocated shares and operations from socially responsible
*  to more indifferent investors and countries.
*  Similarly, a 2021 paper found that divesting of dirty companies that fail to meet ESG criteria
*  is not nearly as impactful as its practitioners might like to believe.
*  Another hurdle to divestment is the nature of modern endowments.
*  Because universities tend to now invest in more complicated financial vehicles, disentangling
*  those investments isn't as simple as selling specific stocks.
*  If, say, a university is invested in an Israeli company through an index fund, which is made
*  up of many, perhaps even hundreds of other companies, it would require the selling of
*  that entire fund, which could mean an overhaul of the endowment's investment strategy.
*  I think it's disingenuous to suggest that it's too complicated to divest from a certain
*  set of assets in the economy, because it shuts down debate.
*  There really are a lot of investment managers out there whose business is to help investors
*  like endowments to invest their assets according to criteria that aren't just maximizing return
*  on investment.
