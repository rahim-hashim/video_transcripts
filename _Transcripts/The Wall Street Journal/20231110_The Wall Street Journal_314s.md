# How Qatar Became the Worldâ€™s Lead Hostage Negotiator | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo)
*  As the war rages over here in Gaza, mediation efforts are being led by Qatar,
*  a tiny peninsula on the Persian Gulf, 1,100 miles away.
*  The country has used its close ties with both Hamas and the West to negotiate the
*  release of hostages from Gaza and get others out through the border crossing with Egypt.
*  It's just the latest example of Qatar's important role on the world stage.
*  From helping the U.S. evacuate thousands of people from Afghanistan to brokering a prisoner
*  swap deal between the U.S. and Iran. Here's how Qatar became such an important player in global
*  diplomacy. Qatar's location and economic clout make it strategically important to a lot of
*  different countries. It shares its only land border with Saudi Arabia, a major power in the
*  Middle East. And it shares the world's largest natural gas field, right here, with Iran,
*  Saudi's biggest regional rival. Exports of liquefied natural gas have made Qatar one of
*  the wealthiest countries in the world, boosting its influence in this volatile region. This has
*  made Qatar a critical energy partner for a lot of countries, especially those in Europe,
*  because the continent has been reducing its reliance on Russian oil and gas.
*  Qatar is also important to the United States, and right here is the biggest U.S. military base in
*  the Middle East. It's been a launching pad for operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.
*  Last year, the U.S. made Qatar a major non-NATO ally. Qatar has also made itself influential in
*  the broader region through Al Jazeera, the largest news media network in the Middle East.
*  But it has been criticized in both the Arab world and the West for its sometimes controversial
*  coverage of uprisings, wars, and other conflicts. For example, the network broadcasts video messages
*  from Osama bin Laden after 9-11. Nevertheless, Qatar prides itself on being a meeting place for
*  diverse viewpoints, which was on full display when the country hosted the World Cup last year.
*  And its ambassador to the U.S. recently wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal,
*  claiming that Qatar is the Mideast's honest broker. In the 1980s and 90s, the country's leaders
*  developed relationships with Iran, as well as regional groups like Hamas in the Palestinian
*  territories and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, groups that are considered terrorist organizations
*  in some parts of the world. It also fostered ties with the Afghan Taliban. In 2013, the Taliban
*  opened a political office in Qatar with support from the U.S. and Afghan governments. Years of
*  negotiations in Doha led to a deal in 2020 for U.S. troops to withdraw from Afghanistan, ending
*  America's longest war. But the agreement didn't bring peace to the country. The Taliban never
*  reached a power-sharing agreement with the Afghan government, and it seized control of Kabul in 2021.
*  Qatar helped to evacuate U.S. citizens in the aftermath, and it is now Washington's diplomatic
*  representative in the country. Hamas also opened a political office in Qatar in 2012, after a
*  request by the Obama administration to establish indirect lines of communication. And Qatar has
*  provided financial aid to Palestinians in Gaza, which is run by Hamas. That has led to accusations
*  of funding terrorism, which Qatar denies. Qatar's complex web of relationships has caused friction
*  with its neighbors. In 2017, it was blockaded by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt.
*  They accused Doha of meddling in their domestic affairs, supporting extremist groups, and being
*  too close to regional rival Iran. The four countries issued a list of demands, including
*  shutting down Al Jazeera and reducing ties with Tehran. Even though Qatar didn't make concessions,
*  the blockade ended in January of 2021, and the terms of the deal haven't been made public.
*  Although the countries reestablished relations, some analysts say that the root causes of that
*  diplomatic crisis haven't been resolved. Today, Qatar's diplomatic relationships are in the
*  spotlight once again, with the country negotiating the release of hostages taken from Israel into
*  Gaza by Hamas. But Qatar said that without a pause in the fighting in Gaza, its mediators
*  won't be able to do their work. It's a very, very difficult negotiation that we've been dealing with.
*  I always say that one of the most difficult mediations is a difficult between two parties
*  that have zero confidence in each other. Israeli officials have said that Qatar's efforts are
*  crucial at this time, but so far only a few hostages have been released.
*  And when the crisis is over, many of Qatar's partners want it to expel Hamas leaders from
*  the country. That includes more than 100 members of Congress who signed a letter to President Biden.
*  Qatar said that the political office of Hamas will remain open as long as it can be used toward peace.
*  Some diplomats worry that those Hamas leaders could move somewhere more hostile to the West,
*  like Iran or Syria. That could make any communication between Hamas,
*  Israel and the West even more complicated in situations like the one that is currently
*  unfolding in the Middle East.
