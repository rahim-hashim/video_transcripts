# Meet the Hamas Attack Victimsâ€™ Families Who Want Peace | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg)
*  This cycle of death, of blood, of revenge is going on for over a century.
*  We are acting the same way and expecting different results.
*  It's horrible to see when there are people getting killed, especially innocent people
*  getting killed.
*  I think there is in both of the sides majority that want to live in peace.
*  We can't destroy Gaza.
*  We can't.
*  Saturday morning I woke up.
*  7.30 checking my WhatsApp that there are sirens and alarms.
*  The bomb sirens started to go off in Jerusalem.
*  I understand what is going on.
*  I call my mom, mom are you okay?
*  My dad told me yes there are many shooting and missile landing around but we are okay.
*  We are in the safe room.
*  And when I turned on my phone around 8.20 two text messages popped up immediately.
*  The first said I love you and immediately the next one said I'm sorry.
*  He was at the music festival when the massacre started to take place.
*  All the young people tried to take cover in these roadside bomb shelters.
*  It came under heavy attack with hand grenades thrown in and an RPG was shot into it.
*  The eyewitnesses told us that his left arm around the elbow down had been blown off
*  and he walked out of the bomb shelter and was loaded on a Hamas pickup truck.
*  His last phone cell signal was found inside of Gaza at 10.25 in the morning and that's
*  all we knew.
*  In 10 a.m. we lost contact with her.
*  My sister called me.
*  She tried to call mom again and the Hamas answered her phone.
*  A few days after we saw in the Hamas Facebook page that they took her into a car.
*  And that's all we know until today.
*  I watched the news and I saw Toyota trucks in the road.
*  I saw the wall falling apart.
*  We tried to call again and again and there was no answer.
*  Around five in the afternoon the security guy of the community called my brother-in-law
*  and he told him that my parents house is burned to ashes with two bodies inside.
*  I'm drowning in this ocean of sorrow and pain and agony but my mind is very clear.
*  My goal number one is to bring all those I kidnapped and being held hostage back home
*  and it must be through a diplomatic agreement.
*  Goal number two is to stop the war and immediate ceasefire.
*  We have these constant cycles of extreme violence and it seems that it's really not working.
*  I don't know that it's ever worked anywhere.
*  I have a lot of anger on the Hamas people, our government, but I don't think to escalate
*  the war will help us not to bring them back and not to give them a peaceful life after.
*  Innocent civilians in Gaza are being killed.
*  Their deaths won't bring my parents back.
*  Their deaths won't bring those that are kidnapped back to their families.
*  For some people a natural response to trauma is to feel hatred.
*  This pain that we are feeling is so unique and indescribable
*  but I really would never wish it on anyone.
*  Not anyone.
*  Not even the people who are doing it to me.
*  That's how bad the pain is.
