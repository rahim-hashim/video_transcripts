# Israel-Gaza Conflict What Satellite Images Tell Us About This Crisis  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [May 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk)
*  One of the distinct features of this operation has been that Israel has targeted a number
*  of high-rise buildings in Gaza.
*  The Israeli military is using tanks and artillery fire, unmanned drones and other sophisticated
*  weapons.
*  The Palestinian militants are firing mainly unguided rockets into Israel.
*  So there's been quite a wide path of destruction on the civilian infrastructure and civilian
*  homes in Gaza.
*  Two specific towers that house a number of media organizations, including one that housed
*  both the Associated Press and Al Jazeera.
*  The Israelis gave warning to the owner of the building to evacuate the building and
*  journalists from the AP and these other organizations had to flee for their lives.
*  Before it was demolished, the Israelis have said that there were Hamas military intelligence
*  using some offices in this building.
*  Both the AP and other organizations have said that they had no evidence that that
*  was the case.
*  Gaza is territorially the size of Washington, D.C., but with a population about three times
*  the size of D.C.
*  And so you can imagine the difficulty of trying to separate civilians from anything you might
*  be trying to bomb in Gaza.
*  The Israeli military says that what it's been targeting is a system of tunnels used by Palestinian
*  militants that is underneath the neighborhoods of the Gaza Strip, as well as rocket construction
*  facilities and militant leaders.
*  And it says are responsible for these rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel.
*  What we've found in our reporting is that a lot of civilians have died in these attacks.
*  Israel has said that they were targeting a tunnel and that the collapse of the building
*  was an accidental result of that attack.
*  It's a situation where there are many people, the vast majority of them civilians, who are
*  scared for their lives and they have nowhere to run because they live in a territory that's
*  been cut off from the outside world and it's a very dense urban center.
*  They are reaching further into Israeli territory attacking Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
*  Israelis will tell you that they are constantly hearing sirens that force them to run to their
*  bomb shelters.
*  Palestinian militants, they are using deadly weapons.
*  There's no doubt about that, but they are at a disadvantage when it comes to fighting
*  Israel which is simply a much more powerful military.
*  Israel has a missile defense system called the Iron Dome which has intercepted, they
*  say about 90% of rockets that have reached Israeli territory.
