# Understanding the U.S.-China Tussle Over Taiwan  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [May 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw)
*  I'm reporting from Taiwan where this island is increasingly becoming a focal point between
*  US and China tensions.
*  I'm going to take you to three places to explain how the competitions between the two
*  superpowers, from the tech to the military, could determine the future of this place.
*  But first, a little history about why Taiwan is so important to China.
*  This island was where the Chinese Nationalist Party fled after its military defeat at the
*  end of the Chinese Civil War in 1939.
*  Today, Taiwan hosts democratic elections, uses a defence passport, and has its own distinct
*  flag.
*  And while some politicians here support closer ties with Beijing, many people have gone uncomfortable
*  with that idea.
*  This is our first stop, the capital of Taiwan, Taipei.
*  Here are growing numbers of young Taiwanese supports closer ties with the US over closer
*  relations with China.
*  Security experts say this kind of statement could mean military actions that push the
*  US into conflict.
*  And recently, there has been a lot more military activity as a strait between the island and
*  mainland China.
*  This is the strait of Taiwan.
*  The Wall Street Journal did a tally of how many Chinese warplanes were in the region
*  using information from Taiwan's defence ministry.
*  And we find that in 2020, China sent about 318 warplanes to this region.
*  But this year, there were already about 219 warplanes.
*  US officials and former Taiwanese military leaders say Taiwan will need to do more to
*  be able to fend off an invasion from China.
*  Especially since China has about 100 times as many ground force personnel as Taiwan.
*  China's annual military budget is also 25 times larger.
*  So in an attempt to fill the gap, last year, Taiwan increased the military spending by
*  10% and has been purchasing weapons from the US.
*  But some military analysts say it's not in China's interest to attack.
*  The seas are rough and Taiwan's coastline makes it difficult for warships to land.
*  Most importantly, an invasion could prompt a military response from the US, which would
*  likely escalate.
*  But if not a military conflict, Taiwan provides at least one more area of competition between
*  the US and China.
*  Behind me is the headquarters of TSMC, the world's largest contract tripmaker.
*  Its trips end up in our smartphone and laptop.
*  But now, because of a global trip shortage, Taiwan is becoming more important to the US
*  and China.
*  That's because TSMC controls more than 90% of the market for the most advanced semiconductor.
*  TSMC has tried to walk the line between China and the US.
*  But the tension between these two countries has made this difficult.
*  Especially after Washington restricts Chinese telecom giants Huawei's access to TSMC over
*  national security concerns.
*  The Trump administration instructed an American supplier to stop working with TSMC if it
*  kept exporting chips to Huawei.
*  To reduce its dependence on Taiwan, China has made chip manufacturing a priority.
*  So has the US, with a commitment of $50 million to building a best sector.
*  But it would take years before these efforts bare fruits, giving the US and China yet another
*  reason to focus on Taiwan.
*  And I can say with confidence that the United States' partnership with Taiwan is stronger
*  than ever.
*  Ultimately, the future of this island is going to be a key challenge for the Biden administration.
*  So the US will have to find a white balance between supporting Taiwan while making sure
*  ongoing tensions with China doesn't escalate further.
