# WSJ Correspondent Sees Panic on Israel-Lebanon Border During Drone False Alarm | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4)
*  The northern border with Lebanon has been active and quite hot since Saturday when Hamas militants carried out the terrorist attack in southern Israel that killed more than 1200 Israelis.
*  There's been skirmishes between Hezbollah fighters and the Israeli military every day.
*  It's sort of been anti-tank fire and small missiles going back and forth.
*  The hope certainly in Israel is that Hezbollah will not launch a major attack.
*  Hezbollah has many more missiles than Hamas.
*  Its missiles are more deadly, more potent, more accurate.
*  It would put incredible strains on Israel's military, on its air defenses if Hezbollah were to join the fight.
*  There are Israeli forces spread out all across the border with Lebanon.
*  There's thousands of soldiers, tanks, artillery positions.
*  It was more tense than I expected it to be.
*  We got to the Israeli border and there were air raid sirens that started going off,
*  indicating that there was potentially incoming missiles or drones or maybe even ground forces, Hezbollah forces coming in.
*  We got to a spot where there was an Israeli military patrol and they waved us into a bomb shelter in the middle of the forest essentially.
*  They said, you got to get out of your car now, you got to come into the shelter now.
*  And so we ran into the shelter.
*  Hey guys.
*  There was about a half dozen Israeli soldiers in there and a handful of Israeli civilians.
*  They were incredibly tense and anxious and they were getting reports over the radio.
*  All indications are there are Hezbollah drones in the sky.
*  It was very, very tense.
*  We were fortunate that the reports of this major attack turned out to be false,
*  but it just sort of for us captured the sense of tension and anxiety.
*  These forces were hearing and being told that the second front had opened.
*  The soldiers here say they are ready.
*  They're ready if that happens.
*  One of the soldiers told us that if Hezbollah joins the fight, they will do to Hezbollah what they're doing right now to Hamas in Gaza.
*  Hezbollah is a much more fearsome military organization than Hamas.
*  They have hundreds of precision guided missiles that can effectively target Tel Aviv.
*  And so it's going to be a much harder fight for Israel.
*  So it would be a real strain for the military.
