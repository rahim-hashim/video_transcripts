# Ukraine Pushes Into Russia, 2024 DNC Begins, Foreign Hacking Targets Trump and Harris, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o)
*  In the coming week, Russia scrambles to push back against a surprise Ukrainian incursion, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=0.0s)]
*  thousands of delegates and protesters gather in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=5.88s)]
*  and U.S. election campaigns consider how to safeguard against foreign cyberattacks [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=11.08s)]
*  as well as homegrown misinformation campaigns and other troubles. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=15.48s)]
*  It's August 15, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=19.32s)]
*  I'm Carly Ann Robbins. Bob McMahon is off this week in Scotland, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=30.0s)]
*  Lucky Man, and today we're joined again by our colleague and friend Miriam Elder. Miriam's a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=38.36s)]
*  reporter and editor specializing in Russia. She's worked for the Moscow Times and The Guardian, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=43.28s)]
*  as well as BuzzFeed and Vanity Fair. And she just finished a year as the Murrow fellow here at CFR. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Miriam, welcome back to the show. We are so lucky to have you with us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  It's my pleasure, and I'm the lucky one. So Miriam, let's start with the Kursk region of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=56.48s)]
*  Russia where last week, starting on August 6, Ukrainian forces suddenly broke through [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  Russia's border, surprising not only the Russians, but pretty much everyone else, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=66.92s)]
*  Kiev's backers in Washington. I think the Pentagon was pretty surprised, the White House as well. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=71.28s)]
*  The Ukrainians have since gained control over a few hundred square miles of territory, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=75.92s)]
*  and the Ukrainians are claiming around 390 square miles. They've taken more than a hundred Russian [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  soldiers prisoner, and this is the biggest attack on Russian military airfield since the war began. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=86.28s)]
*  Some 130,000 people have fled or been evacuated from Russian towns and villages. What do you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=91.0s)]
*  think Ukraine is going for here, and do you think it's going to pay off for them? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=98.56s)]
*  What a stunning turn of events. Like you say, not only has Ukraine taken territory in Kursk, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=101.68s)]
*  but on Wednesday they launched a massive drone attack on Kursk, but also on Voronezh, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=107.6s)]
*  Belgorod, Nizhny Novgorod. This is really the Russian heartland. Ukraine has sporadically [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=112.52s)]
*  attacked Russian territory mainly by drone in the past, but we've never seen a coordinated [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=118.0s)]
*  attack of this size since Russia launched its full-scale invasion two and a half years ago. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=122.84s)]
*  The war has really, as they say and as Zelensky has said himself, it's really come home. As for [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=127.08s)]
*  what they're trying to achieve and whether it has paid off, that remains to be seen. We're well into [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=133.92s)]
*  the second week of this attack, and Ukraine has not outlined its goals. One theory is that it's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=139.2s)]
*  designed to pull Russia's attention and resources from a grinding fight in Donetsk and towards this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  incursion. So far that does not seem to be happening. There are unconfirmed rumors that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  Russia will throw conscripts at the battle in Kursk rather than the hardened troops that they [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=157.6s)]
*  have serving in the territory that it is occupying in Ukraine, but we'll have to see how things unfold [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=163.26s)]
*  in coming days. Why does it matter if they throw conscripts at it? Certainly they won't fight as [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=168.96s)]
*  well. Does that help Ukraine beyond that? Well, it helps in terms of Russian public opinion, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=173.8s)]
*  and that's another thing that experts and the Ukrainians themselves are really watching. Russia, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=179.36s)]
*  even though it's an authoritarian state, public opinion matters to some degree. If you'll remember, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=184.2s)]
*  both in the war in Afghanistan with the Soviet Union and then the war in Chechnya, it was the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=191.12s)]
*  mothers of conscripted soldiers that really formed a significant movement against the Russian [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=196.36s)]
*  authorities. And so there's a lot of fear in the Kremlin against throwing conscripts at the issue, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  both because, as you say, they are not trained in the way that the other troops are, but also [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  for any blowback in Russian society. That remains the number one goal of Vladimir Putin is his hold [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  on power. And I've been actually really quite surprised. The White House, the State Department, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  the Pentagon, they've all been doing this dance about are the Ukrainians using American weapons? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=225.72s)]
*  Are they using NATO weapons? Did they tell you? Did they not tell you? Basically, what people are [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=229.88s)]
*  saying not for retribution is they didn't tell us. We were as surprised as the Russians were. Right [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=234.52s)]
*  now, everyone's doing a happy dance because the Ukrainians seem to be doing remarkably well here [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=238.88s)]
*  and humiliating the Russians. But up until now, and particularly the United States, has been really [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=243.24s)]
*  concerned about pushing Putin too hard and what he could possibly do. And this has been, I think, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=248.96s)]
*  they've held the Ukrainians back to the detriment of their ability to fight the war. Is this [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=254.72s)]
*  dangerous? Could Putin lash out in some really frightening way or have we basically self-deterred [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=259.76s)]
*  too much and this is perhaps the only thing to do to push them back as hard as possible? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=265.6s)]
*  I think both those things are true. On the one hand, there's definitely a lot of concern that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=270.4s)]
*  Putin can lash out in some unforeseen way. He hates to be humiliated and how humiliating is the fact [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=275.2s)]
*  that the Ukrainians literally just rolled over the border with no resistance. So there is a lot [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=282.0s)]
*  of fear. He's certainly very angry. He had a televised meeting with some officials earlier [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=287.76s)]
*  this week and it was clear, clear that he was infuriated with them and with the whole situation. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=292.56s)]
*  Whether the West has put too many constraints on Ukraine, that can also be true. The Ukrainians [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=298.96s)]
*  certainly think so. The war has not been going their way. Certainly this year, we had the failed [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=305.36s)]
*  counteroffensive and how stunningly have they changed the narrative literally overnight. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=311.68s)]
*  How is this playing inside of Ukraine? I mean, people were really despairing and I think also [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=318.0s)]
*  questioning Zelensky's leadership because things have been going so poorly. Is this really giving [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=323.2s)]
*  him a big boost at home? It's certainly a morale booster. I don't know that it will change overnight [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=327.92s)]
*  political feelings about him, but it also sort of doesn't matter because there are no elections [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=334.08s)]
*  for the foreseeable future. But it's certainly the sort of morale boost that you needed first [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=338.48s)]
*  and foremost within the armed forces themselves and then within broader society for sure. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  – Might this affect any future peace negotiations? Zelensky certainly doesn't seem [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=348.24s)]
*  particularly interested in negotiating right now when the Russians are holding so much of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=354.56s)]
*  his territory, but is this setting them up for the beginning of peace negotiations potentially? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=358.0s)]
*  – It could potentially play a role for sure and I'll give a big if here, but if Ukraine can hold [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=363.52s)]
*  on to this territory, which is a big if, there is thinking that if there were peace negotiations [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=369.68s)]
*  at some point in the future, the Ukrainians could use it as a bargaining chip. There is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=376.48s)]
*  growing support within Ukraine or not support, but understanding that this war might have to end [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=381.6s)]
*  in a way that is not just outright military victory, meaning through talks, but there is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=389.36s)]
*  still a lot of opposition to ceding any Ukrainian territory to Russia. So in theory, if the Ukrainians [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=394.48s)]
*  could hold on to this piece of Russian territory, maybe they could use it as a bargaining chip with [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  some of the territory that Russia is trying to hold. But as you say, there are no talks on the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  horizon, but we'll see what happens over the coming months. – I read this really intriguing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=410.24s)]
*  quote, I think it was in the Times today. It was a woman in a shelter who had been evacuated from [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=415.76s)]
*  the Korsk region and she said she had been in the shelter since the start of the war. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=422.0s)]
*  When she was asked how long that was, what she really meant was since the start of the Ukrainian [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=428.88s)]
*  invasion. Here was somebody who lived right next to the border with Ukraine and as far as she was [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=434.56s)]
*  concerned, the conflict only began last week. – Right. I mean, that's by design of the Russian [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=441.12s)]
*  government, right? There are certain regions that have faced drone attacks and things like that from [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=446.4s)]
*  Ukraine. And there's certainly people who have lost loved ones fighting for the Russian military [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=452.16s)]
*  over in Ukraine. But for the most part, Vladimir Putin's message, the message of the entire media [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  apparatus that he controls has been, you know, things are fine, keep living your life. This is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=462.64s)]
*  the contract that he has struck with the Russian people for decades now. Don't worry about politics, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=468.48s)]
*  don't worry about what's going on over here or over there. Focus on your life, let me handle the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=475.36s)]
*  big stuff. And that's why it's so important that this attack is really bringing the war home to [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  people in a very visceral way. – I suppose one final question here, which is we've heard about [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  destruction of some military bases or airstrips. Does this have any, given the Ukrainian, any [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=491.44s)]
*  tactical benefits as well? Are they destroying enough equipment to make a difference in the war [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=498.48s)]
*  or is this really mainly psychological? – No, I think it's both strategic and psychological and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=503.68s)]
*  to some degree tactical as well. Some of the airfields that they have struck have been used [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=510.96s)]
*  by Russia to attack certain parts of Ukraine. So I think the idea is also to limit Russia's ability [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=515.68s)]
*  to attack certain parts of the country. But again, you know, I think that it's over time that we'll [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  understand what the Ukrainians are really trying to achieve here. Just as they launched this attack [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=528.0s)]
*  in secrecy, they have kept the goals, be they strategic, tactical, what have you, they've kept [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=532.8s)]
*  everyone in the dark by design. But Carlo, let's bring it back to the United States. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=538.2399999999999s)]
*  So next Monday, August 19th, the Democratic National Convention begins in Chicago. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=544.72s)]
*  The Democrats have endured a long, tumultuous campaign season, to put it lightly, but the party [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=551.12s)]
*  appears to be enthusiastically behind Kamala Harris. In a virtual roll call, the Harris Wall's tickets [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=556.96s)]
*  secured the support of 99% of the Democratic National Committee delegates. But still, there [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=562.0s)]
*  are a small number of uncommitted delegates and a somewhat larger number of uncommitted voters [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=567.76s)]
*  opposed to US support for Israel in the Gaza War. And thousands of protesters are vowing to make [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=572.32s)]
*  their voices heard outside the convention hall. So Carla, is the Democratic Party as united behind [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  Harris as it seems? We'll see, of course. Democrats have a long history of forming circular firing [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=585.12s)]
*  squads. That didn't happen in the handoff from Biden to Harris. There was no competition for [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  the nomination. There's not going to be a brokered convention. In fact, there isn't even going to be [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  a roll call vote next week. As you said, that was taken care of virtually. And as you note, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=600.64s)]
*  Harris and their running mate, they secured the overwhelming majority of these votes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=606.4s)]
*  But the divisions over Gaza and US support for Israel have not gone away, and it is the most [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=610.72s)]
*  profound division within the party. I think Harris has done a good job, as good a job as can be [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=615.92s)]
*  expected, trying to navigate what is really politically unnavigable inside the Democratic [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=621.92s)]
*  Party. Her markedly different rhetoric on the suffering in Gaza and her earlier than Biden call [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=626.64s)]
*  for a ceasefire has earned her another look from some pro-Palestinian groups. But just a look. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=633.52s)]
*  They want a decision and they're not going to get one. She also got a lot of attention for her [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  steely reaction to chanting protesters at a rally in Detroit last week, which is now being referred [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=645.92s)]
*  to as the Detroit Stare-down. It's not going to get any easier than that. It's certainly not going [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=651.36s)]
*  to be easy next week when thousands, potentially tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=656.4s)]
*  are vowing to march in Chicago. I think the Democrats' worst fear, of course, is a replay [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  of the chaos of the 1968 Chicago Convention. Certainly something I remember. You're probably [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=666.8s)]
*  too young, but I certainly remember it. When police and anti-Vietnam war protesters battled [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=671.76s)]
*  it out in the streets of Chicago, there were even brawls on the floor of the convention. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  I was looking at a clip the other day when security guards roughed up CBS correspondent [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=681.44s)]
*  Dan Rather on camera with Walter Cronkite looking on in dismay. For TV viewers especially, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=686.32s)]
*  it looked like the war had come home to the United States and the Democrats never recovered [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  from that moment. In fact, given that history that you put those words together, Chicago and [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=697.2s)]
*  Democratic Convention, when I heard that the Democrats had decided to put the convention [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=702.6400000000001s)]
*  this year in Chicago, I thought to myself, what the hell were they thinking? That was certainly [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=707.2s)]
*  before this big split over Gaza. Why did they do it? Well, the Midwest is really important. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=710.72s)]
*  Big Union City is really important. They decided to go forward with it. But you can be sure that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  even minor scuffles in the street, President Trump has a big history of attacking so-called [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=722.32s)]
*  Democrat cities as crime dens and hellholes. He once even said that Chicago was worse than Afghanistan. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  This is going to be really tricky. It's an enormous challenge managing protests peacefully. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=733.9200000000001s)]
*  All that is in the hands mainly of local police. Chicago police got really low marks on the way [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=738.56s)]
*  they handled the George Floyd protests. So while it is a policing challenge for Harris, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=743.92s)]
*  the stakes are really, really high. As for the uncommitted delegates, The Times had a really [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=750.7199999999999s)]
*  great story this week. There were about 30 of them and they did interviews with some of them. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=756.2399999999999s)]
*  A lot of them said they understand that Trump would be far worse for their cause, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  but they are still hoping for a full airing of their demands at the convention. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=765.84s)]
*  They want an arms embargo on Israel. The party is not going to put that in. They've been requesting [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  a private meeting for Harris. Maybe they'll get that. They've been requesting speaking time during [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=775.12s)]
*  the convention to make their demands known. Certainly the party wants to portray complete [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=779.2s)]
*  unity on the convention floor. They want to cool things out. We'll see how much they can pull it off. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=784.32s)]
*  Do we know if the party is planning to address the Gaza issue from the stage of the convention, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=790.08s)]
*  whether they've invited anybody or anything? Because we know that before that Detroit protest, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=795.2800000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris met with a couple of the leaders of uncommitted Michigan. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=800.88s)]
*  Are there any plans to address it head on? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=804.88s)]
*  There's some discussion about bringing together hostage families as well as a political [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=807.36s)]
*  representative, potentially a Muslim city councilman who is not a direct leader of the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=814.4s)]
*  uncommitted movement, but related to the uncommitted movement. Bringing them both, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  whether it will be on prime time or not, whether that will satisfy the uncommitted, certainly [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=824.9599999999999s)]
*  unlikely to satisfy the people in the street itself. But I'm sure that they will make some [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=830.0s)]
*  effort to air some of the concerns. The uncommitted wanted to have a big address by an American doctor [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=834.48s)]
*  who had been working in Gaza to describe the suffering. I just don't know how far they're [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=840.64s)]
*  willing to go to satisfy these demands. Unity is incredibly important. And I think if you listen [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=844.56s)]
*  to Harris herself, I think she is genuinely moved and genuinely concerned about this. I mean, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=850.48s)]
*  it's profound, but right now unity is incredibly important in balancing the demands of the different [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=855.36s)]
*  wings of the Democratic party. This is one of these things, it's impossible to square the circle, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=860.64s)]
*  but they're going to really, really try hard to square it this week. And probably the biggest [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=865.04s)]
*  challenge is not going to be inside the hall. The biggest challenge is going to be outside the hall. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=869.76s)]
*  So we'll have to see whether the Chicago police can pull it off. But even the most minor of scuffling, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=873.84s)]
*  you can expect the Trump campaign to make a big deal about it. Miriam, let's shift to another US [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=879.6s)]
*  election issue, which is foreign hacking. Last week in the Trump presidential campaign announced [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=885.2s)]
*  that some of its internal communications were hacked by Iran after Politico and The Washington [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=891.2s)]
*  Post reported receiving internal campaign documents, specifically OPPO research on [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=895.92s)]
*  now GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. The FBI then put out a very brief statement [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=902.4s)]
*  that it had begun investigating in June attempts by Iran to hack both the presidential campaigns. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=908.3199999999999s)]
*  And yesterday, Wednesday, the Google threat analysis group wrote that a group, an Iranian [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=914.64s)]
*  group APT 42 had targeted quote, the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen individuals [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=919.84s)]
*  affiliated with President Biden and with former President Trump. What about those emails? Is this [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=926.4s)]
*  2016 Redux? And are we going to do a better job of not getting crazy about it? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=931.76s)]
*  Well, we've all been kind of waiting for this, right? The hacking of campaigns seems to be [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=937.76s)]
*  a new feature of our politics, at least since 2016, as you rightly mentioned. And experts have [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=942.48s)]
*  been warning for months that adversaries like Russia, China and Iran could seek to influence [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=948.32s)]
*  the election. The specter of Iran was first raised by Microsoft, right? When they revealed [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=953.9200000000001s)]
*  last week that a group run by the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards had hacked into [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=959.0400000000001s)]
*  the account of a former senior advisor to a presidential campaign who now appears to be Trump's [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=963.6s)]
*  buddy, Roger Stone. I love this. I love the fact that he's back. Of course it's Roger Stone. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=968.1600000000001s)]
*  And while the FBI is investigating, no US officials have yet publicly blamed Iran, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  but it would fit with the general pattern, especially when it comes to Trump. From exiting [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=980.32s)]
*  the Iran nuclear deal to ordering the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani, Trump has long been an [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=984.96s)]
*  antagonist to the country. And there've been concerns within the campaign that Iran would [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=991.0400000000001s)]
*  try to retaliate not just by hacking, but by harming Trump himself. But back to the cyber stuff. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=995.36s)]
*  So I guess one way to think about it is what is being done to better protect both campaigns. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1000.88s)]
*  And the fact that the FBI is investigating is important for a host of reasons. One of them being, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1007.0400000000001s)]
*  you can quote Adam Schiff here, who said last week that federal officials have to release all [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1013.2s)]
*  their information because, quote, transparency is still our best deterrent against foreign influence [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1017.9200000000001s)]
*  operations. And the thing is here you're dealing with Trump, who's notoriously suspicious of the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1023.6s)]
*  federal government in general and the FBI in particular. So you have to wonder how much [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1029.92s)]
*  information they're really turning over, how cooperative they are being. And the campaign, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1035.68s)]
*  when they first discovered this, they didn't actually even tell the FBI. No, exactly. So [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1041.04s)]
*  I'm sure that there's a secondary concern here, the hacking being first and foremost. But [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1046.72s)]
*  secondarily, when you have a campaign that has structured itself as being so suspicious of the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1051.3600000000001s)]
*  FBI that then they won't call on the FBI when they need their help, you have to wonder how [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1057.36s)]
*  the investigation is going to go over the next few months and whether that leaves a window open [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1063.6s)]
*  for further attacks. I think certainly Iran has good reason to want to make life difficult for [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1067.76s)]
*  the Trump campaign. Although if you listen to Google and you listen to what the FBI said, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1073.36s)]
*  they seem to be equal opportunity offenders. They seem to be going after both campaigns. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1077.6799999999998s)]
*  And likely they are not the only ones spreading their hacking wares. The Chinese have a long [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1082.56s)]
*  history of doing it. Certainly we know the Russians have a long history of doing it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1088.16s)]
*  Then you've got the fact of the whole domestic chaos, which is, and if I were going to predict [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1092.4s)]
*  trouble in the campaign season, I could spend at least as much time looking domestically [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1098.64s)]
*  on questions of disinformation and people challenging the results of the vote. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1104.32s)]
*  And so I've got a few questions I want to talk about. I think maybe the first one is to go back [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1110.72s)]
*  to this question, what about her emails? Certainly, I think there's no question about this, that we in [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1114.72s)]
*  the press really, really did a terrible job in the 2016 campaign. And we just went completely nuts [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1118.8s)]
*  about the Hillary Clinton emails. It was the bright and shiny object. It was six-year-olds [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  playing soccer, everybody chasing the soccer ball. So far, there were the JD Vance op-o research. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1128.96s)]
*  Do you think we'll do a better job this time if something more damaging gets hacked and the hack [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1135.6000000000001s)]
*  and leak operations show up? Do you think that we've learned our lesson in the media? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1141.6000000000001s)]
*  I think some lessons have been learned for sure. Back in 2016, the famous case that came out of [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1146.0s)]
*  that was these emails dropped through WikiLeaks and suddenly everybody has a story about John [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1151.76s)]
*  Podesta's risotto recipe. Does that clear a bar for newsworthiness? No, but also the field was [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1156.64s)]
*  truly unpracticed then. That was an unprecedented situation. So I have some sympathy for people [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1163.04s)]
*  trying to muddle their way through how to do this. And then you look at what's happening now, which [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1170.72s)]
*  is supposedly what we know from Politico, The Post, and I think the New York Times as well said [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1175.04s)]
*  they got these emails, is that it was opposition research on Vance, but it was all public statements. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1180.24s)]
*  So at that point, we haven't seen the reporting coming out of this. Because at that point, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1187.04s)]
*  the hack is the news, right? And the content of it is all out there already. And by using it, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1193.44s)]
*  maybe you do play into a nefarious operation. So I think we're already seeing the media being more [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1198.72s)]
*  cautious. Now, some critics are spinning that as well. The media goes hard on Democrats and is so [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1204.6399999999999s)]
*  soft on Trump. I don't think that that's the case here. I think that there has been reflection, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1210.32s)]
*  probably not enough. I'm sure we'll see plenty of mistakes as we always do. But the way that I've [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1215.68s)]
*  always thought about working with hacked material is, first of all, every single one is a difficult [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1221.12s)]
*  call. But the information has to rise to a certain bar for it to be usable because you are at that [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1225.76s)]
*  point, part of some sort of nefarious operation. And certainly you have to always tell your reader, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1232.32s)]
*  your listener, your viewer who benefits, you know, why have I been given this information? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1240.4799999999998s)]
*  And I don't think that there was anywhere near enough of that going on in 2016. You've got to [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1246.8s)]
*  figure out what the motivation was. And as much as John Podesta is a wonderful cook, and there was [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1253.68s)]
*  the risotto, there were other things that were there. I mean, we're obviously much more sophisticated [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1259.04s)]
*  now. But you know, there were these Hillary Clinton speeches to bankers and all these other things. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1263.52s)]
*  And everyone acted as if these things were the focus of her alleged hypocrisy and all that. But [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1268.8799999999999s)]
*  it was an inside the look and the fact that anything was secret, secret becomes news. And [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1275.36s)]
*  I think we're more sophisticated now. But I think perhaps the most important thing is to try to [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1282.4799999999998s)]
*  figure out why we're getting what we're getting, you know, who's benefiting from it and but making [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1287.9199999999998s)]
*  the decision of I mean, there are people out there who say if it's hacked, you don't report it at all. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1294.08s)]
*  I don't subscribe to that. No, I agree with you there. And I mentioned the risotto as something [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  that is just silly and fluffy and ridiculous and should not have been published. That's an [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1305.04s)]
*  invasion of privacy. There is no public service. It's just like salacious, salacious risotto recipe. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1308.56s)]
*  Salacious risotto recipe. Yes. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1314.72s)]
*  Whereas some of the stuff is truly newsworthy. And I agree with you entirely about the secrecy [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1317.68s)]
*  issue. You know, remember in 2016, when we had Trump standing on the stage, I believe it was in [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1323.2s)]
*  Florida, calling directly to WikiLeaks saying if you have the emails, or to Russia, I'm [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1328.08s)]
*  sorry to Russia. Yeah, exactly. If you know, and that was public. So people sort of rolled their [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1334.96s)]
*  eyes. If it had been done secretly, and somebody had found an email or a note passed across a table, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1340.16s)]
*  it would have been the scandal of the century. Here, it was just another thing that Trump [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  spouted from a stage. I agree. And it's one of the things that is since I also believe that that some [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1351.3600000000001s)]
*  of the biggest problems that we're going to be facing in the next weeks, I fear, have to do with [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1357.3600000000001s)]
*  domestically driven disinformation, as well as all the stop the steal challenges. And you do see [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1363.1200000000001s)]
*  things and we're seeing this in Georgia right now, this organization that's on local county [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1370.0800000000002s)]
*  levels that are developing about people who are going to challenge every result and try to delay [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1374.64s)]
*  the reporting. And we're seeing this, you know, state by state, county by county, the certain [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1378.96s)]
*  numbers of people who are gearing up for it and people casting doubts on the legitimacy of voting [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1382.4s)]
*  by mail and all the things that we saw in 2020 that are going on. This question of the legitimacy [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1387.84s)]
*  of the election, what the FBI so far has been saying is that if there is domestically driven [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1394.0s)]
*  disinformation, that they're not going to be calling balls and strikes. That they will [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1400.72s)]
*  raise alarms about things that are internationally driven, but that for domestic, they're not going [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1406.3999999999999s)]
*  to call balls and strikes because they're not in the truth deciding business itself. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1411.12s)]
*  That's pretty disturbing, which I think puts more pressure on us as journalists to be fact [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1415.92s)]
*  checking things. And that's one of the issues itself. But there is that other question here [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1421.84s)]
*  that the government has to decide, which is it should be in the business of defending the [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1428.6399999999999s)]
*  legitimacy of the electoral process. That's not a partisan exercise. Defending the legitimacy of [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1433.28s)]
*  elections is not a partisan exercise. And the Obama administration really was late in raising [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1439.2s)]
*  the alarm. They decided not to raise the alarm, even when they saw the Russian hacking, because [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1445.8400000000001s)]
*  they didn't want to cast doubt about, you know, because Trump is raising so many doubts about the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1451.3600000000001s)]
*  election. I think somebody's got to raise the alarm when this is happening, and you can't wait [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1455.04s)]
*  till after the fact. And if the FBI is not going to say that, you know, that when really serious [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1460.64s)]
*  questions are being raised about, you know, and disinformation is being pushed out there, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1465.52s)]
*  I think it puts a lot more pressure on us in the media. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1468.8s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. And I think that there's actually plenty that can be done right now. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1471.84s)]
*  What you're describing, having people on the ground in various states to call out, you know, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1476.08s)]
*  alleged election improprieties, that's been the entire organizing principle of the Trump campaign. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1480.96s)]
*  That was revealed in an article in the Atlantic by Tim Alberta that came out a few weeks ago. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1486.24s)]
*  This is what Trump means when he talks about, quote, election integrity. They have agents all [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1491.12s)]
*  across the country that are going to be ready to flip on a dime and do God knows what. And I think [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1496.72s)]
*  that we could and should see a lot more reporting on what they're really trying to do there. Now, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1502.08s)]
*  there's a few months ahead of the election, let people know that this is coming. One of the best [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1507.76s)]
*  ways to undermine disinformation, be it internationally, domestically, what have you, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1512.8s)]
*  is get ahead of the story. And that's something that reporters could really be focusing on more [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1517.04s)]
*  now. So Carla, it is time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1522.0s)]
*  This is the figure that listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1531.68s)]
*  underscore orgs Instagram story. This week, Carla, our audience selected Mexico rejects [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1536.0s)]
*  Putin ICC arrest. Isn't Mexico a member of the ICC? So why is it ignoring the ICC arrest warrants [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1542.48s)]
*  for Putin? Well, Miriam, you're the Putin expert, but I think it's very unlikely that he's going to [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1550.0s)]
*  be traveling to Mexico anytime soon. So this issue is likely moot. But as you said, Mexico is a member [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1555.44s)]
*  of the international criminal court and it is obligated to arrest him under an ICC warrant. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1562.24s)]
*  And it stated refusal is another really depressing reminder, both of the limited power of the court [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1568.08s)]
*  and a really depressing reminder of how Russia is not paying nearly as high an international [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1575.6s)]
*  price as it should for the crimes and it is committing a lot of them in Ukraine. So why are [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1580.4799999999998s)]
*  we talking about this? Mexico invited Putin to the October 1st inauguration of its new president, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1586.8s)]
*  Claudia Scheinbaum. The government's explanation was it invited every country and organization [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1592.48s)]
*  it has diplomatic relations with. And apparently there is no carve out for countries whose leaders [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1598.24s)]
*  are under indictment for the war crime of kidnapping children. And when the news of the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1602.96s)]
*  invitation got out, Ukraine's government sent a request to the Mexicans that they fulfill their [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1607.8400000000001s)]
*  ICC obligation. And Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, AMLO, told reporters, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1612.3200000000002s)]
*  quote, we can't do that. It's not up to us. The court remember has no troops, doesn't have bailers, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1618.96s)]
*  doesn't have anybody. And so it relies on member states to arrest and deliver the accused. And [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1624.3200000000002s)]
*  cases can't go forward unless they are brought to the Hague. There's no in absentia. Now, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1629.92s)]
*  Mexico is not the first one. Other states have failed in its obligation. South Africa hosted [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  Sudan's former dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2015. Jordan hosted Sudanese former leader in 2017, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  despite the fact that he was under indictment on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1646.72s)]
*  war crimes for his role in that horrific campaign in Darfur. And he is still at large. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1650.96s)]
*  But you know, you'd really think that Mexico, given its history with the United States next [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1657.28s)]
*  to war and losing a good amount of its territory to us, would be sympathetic to the plight of Ukraine. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1661.76s)]
*  And it has voted twice to condemn the invasion, but it also abstained from a UN General Assembly [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1667.92s)]
*  vote on suspending Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. But you know, really this latest move, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1673.2s)]
*  inviting Putin to the inauguration and rejecting their obligation to arrest him. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1679.52s)]
*  Well, there's no other word for it. In Spanish, you'd say it was sin verguenza, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1684.96s)]
*  just completely lacking in shame. They should be embarrassed. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1689.04s)]
*  I saw that they also invited Nicolas Maduro, which seems somehow even kookier. I mean, that's [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1693.28s)]
*  basically putting a call in on this disputed election, is it not? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1699.68s)]
*  Sin verguenza. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1704.88s)]
*  Okay. And that's our look at the world next week. Here are some other stories to keep an eye on. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqk7z0Cy93o&t=1707.92s)]
