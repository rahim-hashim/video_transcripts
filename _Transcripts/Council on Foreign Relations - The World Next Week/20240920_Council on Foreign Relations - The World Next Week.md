# UN Meets in Tense Times, Pager Explosions Rattle Hezbollah, Biden’s Last Quad Summit, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA)
*  In the coming week, the annual UN General Assembly debates take place amid global turbulence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=0.0s)]
*  Hezbollah reels from unusual and shocking attacks from explosive pagers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=5.0s)]
*  And President Biden hosts his last Quad Summit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=10.0s)]
*  It's September 19th, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=13.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=27.0s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, Bob, let's start in New York, where I live and I am not today, with the UN General Assembly high-level debate, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=29.0s)]
*  which spells an enormous amount of traffic and we hope some interesting events. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=36.0s)]
*  Can we expect any big speeches or at least some performance art from the podium? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah, the performance art is rarely telegraphed ahead of time, so it means you have to sometimes sit through some 40- to 50-minute speeches. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=46.0s)]
*  Or in the famous case of Fidel Castro, a four-hour speech. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=53.0s)]
*  Or in the case of Castro, he was somebody that people would watch just to see how far he would go sometimes, or Qaddafi. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=56.0s)]
*  Although not historically the longest speech, but we can talk about that someday. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=61.0s)]
*  Yes. What will be of interest this year, comings and goings, the last UN address of Joe Biden, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=65.0s)]
*  where he just seemed like yesterday coming to say the US was back multilaterally and he laid out all sorts of markers. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=71.0s)]
*  We'll get back to him in a second. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=77.0s)]
*  There will be the first UN address by the new Iranian president, Pesachin, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=79.0s)]
*  who has been making overtures towards reviving the Iranian nuclear deal as well as opening up the country's economy, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=84.0s)]
*  even amid reports that Iran is beefing up its missile deals to Russia, which Iran denies, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=90.0s)]
*  or certainly been backing its axis of resistance countering Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=96.0s)]
*  So that will be interesting because it's on the same day as Biden. It's the afternoon of the speech. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=101.0s)]
*  Biden is going to speak early in the session on the first day on Tuesday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=105.0s)]
*  A couple of days later, there will be scheduled speech by Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, which promises to be a doozy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=110.0s)]
*  There will also be the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas speaking that same day. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=117.0s)]
*  That will be interesting. Ukrainian President Zelensky is scheduled to speak as well on day two, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=122.0s)]
*  although Vladimir Putin, as usual, will not be representing Russia, be setting as foreign minister. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=127.0s)]
*  Putin has not appeared at the UN podium since 2015. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=133.0s)]
*  Wow, since 2015, really? He wasn't even under an indictment in those days. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=136.0s)]
*  So Pesachin should be quite interesting because is he a reformist? Isn't he a reformist? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=141.0s)]
*  Given everything that's going on in the Middle East and all the deaths, is he going to get up there and make some offers, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=147.0s)]
*  or is he going to hew to the tougher line? That's probably the one that I'm most looking for. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=154.0s)]
*  President Zelensky is obviously quite unhappy with the UN, which is a question I want to ask you about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=160.0s)]
*  Israel, Netanyahu, of course, the General Assembly has just really taken them to the woods in a really basic way this week. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=166.0s)]
*  Almost nobody voting in defense of Israel's occupation anymore. They have no friends left. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=173.0s)]
*  So I would suspect he's going to be pretty in their face. And Abbas, does he still have it? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=178.0s)]
*  He's really old and does not seem to be much of a player. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=185.0s)]
*  So I suppose people are going to be watching that one pretty closely to see whether there's any leadership there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=187.0s)]
*  Because, of course, the Americans want the Palestinian PA to be a renewed PA, reformed PA, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=192.0s)]
*  a revised PA to take over leadership if there's ever some sort of a peace deal in Gaza. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=198.0s)]
*  Who is Abbas? Where is Abbas? I think there's a lot to watch there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=203.0s)]
*  One of the questions that I'm hearing this from my students, who actually are believers in the UN, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=207.0s)]
*  in part they come to my program because our school, Baruch, is so close to the UN, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=212.0s)]
*  but they are very frustrated because the UN has been unable to do anything to stop the war in Gaza. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=217.0s)]
*  They've been unable to do anything to stop the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=222.0s)]
*  They ask a very legitimate question that a lot of people are going to be asking. Why should we even pay any attention? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=225.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a question that comes up and comes up appropriately every year. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=230.0s)]
*  It seems to be much more to the point this year, given everything going on in the world [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=234.0s)]
*  and the somewhat marginal role really the UN seems to be playing, especially in the two really big conflicts, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=239.0s)]
*  the Israel Hamas and Russia Ukraine. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=245.0s)]
*  It did play some mediating role in opening up some sea lanes for Ukrainian grain temporarily. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=248.0s)]
*  That was the Secretary General Guterres, but Turkey also played a really important role there. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=254.0s)]
*  And then Ukraine ended up taking matters into its own hands and has been delivering its grain in its own fashion [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=259.0s)]
*  without the help of any intermediaries. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=264.0s)]
*  You have Russia sitting in the UN Security Council and routinely quashing an effort to provide serious scrutiny [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=267.0s)]
*  of its invasion of Ukraine and its conduct of that war. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=273.0s)]
*  And in a different way, but also drawing comparisons, is the US defense of Israel and efforts in the Security Council [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=277.0s)]
*  and other UN bodies to try to bring about a ceasefire since Israeli actions, again, responding to the brutal Hamas attacks [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=283.0s)]
*  of October 7th, almost a year ago. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=290.0s)]
*  But what a number of observers, especially UN agencies say has been a disproportionate response that's been killing Palestinian civilians in Gaza. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=292.0s)]
*  So there seems to be a keen desire to bring that to an end once and for all. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=300.0s)]
*  It is still proving elusive. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=304.0s)]
*  The US has been trying to drive through some sort of an agreement painstakingly, and it's proving to be a really tough one. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=306.0s)]
*  And it continues to be this major concern, which we'll address a little bit later in the podcast, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=314.0s)]
*  about a real escalation, a region-wide escalation of conflict in the Middle East, which is confounding the UN. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=319.0s)]
*  The UN still plays a really important humanitarian role. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=326.0s)]
*  It is a chief provider of aid to Palestinian refugees. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=329.0s)]
*  There's still a UN peacekeeping contingent in Lebanon, which is in a kind of a fraught moment right now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=333.0s)]
*  But it's a reminder that even as it's marginalized, the UN system is a place where countries end up coming back to again and again, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=338.0s)]
*  even when they tend to skirt it for other reasons, especially in terms of the UN political response, because they need it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=347.0s)]
*  They need its agencies. They need its humanitarian help. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=353.0s)]
*  Sometimes they need its ability to step in as peacekeeping. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=355.0s)]
*  I'll point to another difficult chapter. There's been a number of these difficult chapters. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=358.0s)]
*  This one feels tougher than others. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=362.0s)]
*  But then the lead up to the Iraq War, the US was on the Security Council. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=364.0s)]
*  It must be said the US was trying to justify its pending invasion of Iraq through observance of Security Council resolutions about disarmament. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=367.0s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it pushed through and said it was invading because Iraq was presenting a grave and gathering threat. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=375.0s)]
*  And it was seen as a real blow to the UN system that the US proceeded to push forward in that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=382.0s)]
*  Soon after, though, after Saddam Hussein was toppled and the US was trying to set up some sort of rump government there, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=388.0s)]
*  it came back to the UN to try to hold elections, to set up all sorts of administrative functions within Iraq. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=394.0s)]
*  And this happens over and over again. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=401.0s)]
*  It's not to say that the UN is hyper relevant in this particular moment right now, but it is to say that it does play a role. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=403.0s)]
*  I would just say generally, though, we're going to hear a great deal of strumming and drumming in the coming week about the UN's role, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=410.0s)]
*  but also the role of individual states. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=417.0s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, the UN is the sum of its parts. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=419.0s)]
*  And it's when these major states, especially Security Council states, are driving change through the UN is when it's most effective. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=422.0s)]
*  The Security Council is sort of ground zero for why it's ineffective right now. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=430.0s)]
*  There is major impasse going on there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=434.0s)]
*  There's real antagonism involving the United States and Russia, but also China in a number of occasions. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=437.0s)]
*  And so it's a real difficult place right now. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=442.0s)]
*  I'll finally add that the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, laid out some markers at a CFR event last week about Security Council reform. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=445.0s)]
*  She said that the United States seems to be very sensible pursuing two permanent seats for African nations, pursuing rotating representation for island nations. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=454.0s)]
*  But that's going to be a tough, as she acknowledged, a really tough road to hoe, especially as the Biden administration winds down and we don't know what's coming next in the US. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=462.0s)]
*  She's talking about perm seats, like veto-bearing seats? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=471.0s)]
*  Not veto-bearing, because it's widely acknowledged that the five, the current five veto-wielding countries are, first of all, would just never allow that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=474.0s)]
*  And she also called it expanding the dysfunction of the council. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=482.0s)]
*  She says the veto is a source of dysfunction, even while acknowledging the US will not give up its veto power either. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=486.0s)]
*  So veto is staying with the five set up in the post-World War II period. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=491.0s)]
*  So a new definition of permanent. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=495.0s)]
*  So a new definition of permanent where you basically have, although it seems like weak tea to some, you do have countries that will have a permanent ability to be debating issues and raising issues on the agenda at the UN, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=496.0s)]
*  raising a fuss in some cases and certainly complaining if some of their initiatives are getting vetoed by other more powerful members. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=508.0s)]
*  But it's still seen as a step forward to have some permanent membership in the Security Council even without the veto power. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=515.0s)]
*  I love that term about the dysfunction. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=522.0s)]
*  I think that's a, you know, it sort of can't live without it, certainly that, including the veto structure. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=524.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Security Council, even with this dysfunction, it must be noted, and we'll have a piece up on our website soon from Paul Stairs and Natalie Koloka, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=530.0s)]
*  pointing to areas where the council has continued to function through its problems, you know, setting up what is still a work in progress, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=537.0s)]
*  which is some sort of a pacifying mission in Haiti, allowing Kenyans and some other forces to deploy there. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=544.0s)]
*  And in addition to providing aid of various sorts, UN is said to have played a constructive role in Colombia. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=551.0s)]
*  It could still play a role in Sudan, which is an absolute disaster. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=557.0s)]
*  It is the world's worst humanitarian crisis right now. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=561.0s)]
*  And big outside powers have been one of the reasons for that in terms of helping to support warring sides. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=563.0s)]
*  But it could still play a role. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=569.0s)]
*  It could still play a role in Myanmar, where it's been sidelined as well. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=571.0s)]
*  But Myanmar seems to be coming to a head, the situation there in terms of threats to the central government, the military junta. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=574.0s)]
*  So it comes back to what do the most powerful nations want? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=580.0s)]
*  Do they see the UN as useful? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=585.0s)]
*  And is there enough leverage from other countries to make the UN function in a way that can help in the way it was intended to be when it was set up, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=587.0s)]
*  even with its anachronisms and the way its composition is with veto-wielding states and so forth? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=595.0s)]
*  We come back to the refrain that if it didn't exist, that something like the UN would be created to kind of step into the breach. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=601.0s)]
*  And as Adlai Stevenson says, when you have that platform there, they're prepared to wait for a response until hell frees us over. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=607.0s)]
*  One of my favorite moments with the Security Council. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=614.0s)]
*  There is drama in the Security Council as there is at the pulpit in the UN General Assembly. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=617.0s)]
*  So stay tuned, Carla, for that. It's not just about the traffic next week. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=621.0s)]
*  One other thing I should mention is that has accompanied this UNGA event now for the last 15 years has been a New York City climate week. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=624.0s)]
*  It's just to say that climate activists have seen this as an opportunity to kind of focus attention, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=631.0s)]
*  to raise their profile amongst the gathered diplomats about climate issues. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=636.0s)]
*  And then those 15 years, all the climate benchmarks have only gotten worse in terms of, you know, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=641.0s)]
*  consecutive months now of record-setting temperatures, extreme weather events. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=646.0s)]
*  The island nations that I mentioned before, they are trying to raise serious alarms about just their own existence with rising sea levels. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=651.0s)]
*  And we've seen in the past year also things like insurance companies are dropping homeowners [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=658.0s)]
*  because they can't support people who live anywhere near a flood zone, fire zone, you name it, and those zones are getting bigger. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=663.0s)]
*  So climate is going to continue to be a topic on the sidelines, but still a topic. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=669.0s)]
*  Carla, I want to take us back to the Middle East because it has been quite a week in the Middle East, especially in Lebanon, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=674.0s)]
*  where in the course of two days, hundreds of pagers and then walkie-talkies exploded. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=680.0s)]
*  These were most of them in the possession of Hezbollah members, if not fighters, but there were also bystanders who were killed. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=685.0s)]
*  The UN and other news agencies believe Israel is behind the attack. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=692.0s)]
*  Israel officials have not commented publicly, but they have said that the Israel-Hezbollah war is entering a new phase. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=695.0s)]
*  There's been movement of Israeli forces towards the north of the country. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=701.0s)]
*  And so are we looking at a further escalation in what has been a low-wattage Israel-Hezbollah conflict? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=704.0s)]
*  Well, this is sort of an extraordinary story. And watch this space right now. We're not clear. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=711.0s)]
*  Certainly what were the Israelis trying to do is one of the biggest questions out there. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=717.0s)]
*  It's an extraordinary intelligence coup on their part. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=722.0s)]
*  The Times reporting this morning says that instead of intercepting these pagers and walkie-talkies that exploded in people's hands, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=725.0s)]
*  an incredible carnage, instead of intercepting them somewhere along the supply chain to insert explosives, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=733.0s)]
*  Israeli intelligence actually manufactured them. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=739.0s)]
*  They set up a front company, and as far as Hezbollah knew, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=743.0s)]
*  they thought it was a Hungarian company under contract to a Taiwan manufacturer. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=747.0s)]
*  And the Israelis produced the pagers and then sold them to Hezbollah. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=751.0s)]
*  They started shipping these pagers back in 2022. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=755.0s)]
*  After Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah told his operatives earlier this year that the Israelis were using their smartphones to track them [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=758.0s)]
*  and ordered them to replace them with these low-tech pagers, which they believed were much harder to track, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=765.0s)]
*  the Israelis stepped up production and delivery and these thousands of pagers and some walkie-talkies were spread throughout Lebanon in the hands of the cadre of Hezbollah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=771.0s)]
*  And chillingly, according to the Times, Israeli intelligence officers called these pagers buttons. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=782.0s)]
*  They were referring them to buttons that could be pushed whenever the order came. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=787.0s)]
*  It's a pretty cold description there. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=791.0s)]
*  So the question, of course, is why now? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=794.0s)]
*  Why did they decide to use this pretty indiscriminate weapon right now? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=796.0s)]
*  And whether these attacks and the damages frighteningly widespread will make Israel safer or just spark a wider war, as you asked. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=801.0s)]
*  The government announced before they pushed this button that they were going to shift their strategic focus away from Gaza and toward the north, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=811.0s)]
*  which is their second front with Lebanon, and that they're determined to do whatever they can to stop the shelling from Hezbollah [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=820.0s)]
*  that has driven more than 70,000 Israelis from their homes since the start of the Gaza War. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=827.0s)]
*  We've talked about this before. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=833.0s)]
*  There are American and French mediators shuttling between Lebanon and Israel. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=835.0s)]
*  But the assumption has always been that until there's some sort of hostage ceasefire deal, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=839.0s)]
*  that there's not going to be any calm on that border as well. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=844.0s)]
*  And the Israelis seem to have decided that there's not going to be a deal, or at least not for a while. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=848.0s)]
*  Netanyahu is feeling an enormous amount of pressure from the families that have been displaced in the political scene. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=853.0s)]
*  And Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant, who may or may not be on his way out the door, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=859.0s)]
*  said this week that, quote, military action was the only way to end the conflict on the northern border. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=864.0s)]
*  Is this going to change anything? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=871.0s)]
*  Certainly all the reporting, people in Lebanon are completely freaked out, as we would be as well. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=873.0s)]
*  Some are comparing it to October 7th and its physical and psychological impact. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=879.0s)]
*  Other people are talking about 9-11. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=883.0s)]
*  I mean, if you can't trust electronic devices, because people aren't just worrying about pagers and walkie talkies. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=885.0s)]
*  They're talking unplug your cell phones, unplug your TVs. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=890.0s)]
*  They just don't know where it's coming from because these are normal devices in their hands. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=893.0s)]
*  It's killed off some unknown percentage of Hezbollah's cadre, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=897.0s)]
*  certainly disrupted their communications for a while. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=901.0s)]
*  How much of their actual chain of command has been disrupted? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=905.0s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=907.0s)]
*  We haven't seen any reports of major leaders being killed. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=908.0s)]
*  We know that the Iranian ambassador in Lebanon was wounded. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=911.0s)]
*  We haven't seen major names beyond that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=915.0s)]
*  And Nasrallah gave a speech just a few hours ago, and he obviously was furious about it, described it as an act of war. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=918.0s)]
*  But he also acknowledged that it is a blow that is unprecedented in its history. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=927.0s)]
*  And he said that Israel has a clear technological advantage because it is not only Israel, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=931.0s)]
*  and he said it's also backed by the United States, although the U.S. denies it had any involvement or any knowledge of it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=936.0s)]
*  He also sounded like a man who didn't know what he was going to do next. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=942.0s)]
*  He vowed retaliation, but he also said, not going to talk about the place or the time. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=945.0s)]
*  So it's not clear what they're going to do. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=950.0s)]
*  Once again, as we have said week after week, is this going to lead to that wider war that we're so terrified of? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=952.0s)]
*  Some people in Israel are saying, this is going to tell Hezbollah we can get you anytime, anyplace. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=959.0s)]
*  So back off, guys. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=965.0s)]
*  And other people are saying that this is going to be the one that pushes them over the edge. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=967.0s)]
*  Right now, all we know is that lots of people have been hurt. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=970.0s)]
*  Lebanon is in incredible disarray, and the Israelis are flying jets. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=974.0s)]
*  Even when Israel was speaking, there were sonic booms. You could hear them over Beirut. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=978.0s)]
*  It is quite an unusual moment again in a year, really, almost a year that has been extraordinary [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=982.0s)]
*  and has had extraordinary developments one after the other that we have talked about and have been flagged. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=987.0s)]
*  But this use of the supply chain, as you mentioned, the front company and all of that, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=992.0s)]
*  raises a lot of concern about, as we're seeing in increasing reports, the laws of war, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=998.0s)]
*  aside from the threat that Israel is trying to hold off and its legitimate concern about its population near the Lebanese border. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1002.0s)]
*  I'm looking at my cell phone right now and saying to myself, what can you trust? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1009.0s)]
*  Exactly. So cyber experts are raising that concern. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1013.0s)]
*  The unusual situation already pre-existing, which you had an organization like Hezbollah, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1017.0s)]
*  this militant organization that was taking the fight to Israel, even obviously much earlier for decades than October 7th, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1022.0s)]
*  but since then regularly lobbying explosives, missiles and so forth and Israeli targets. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1029.0s)]
*  And it's a movement that's embedded in Lebanese society, Lebanese government. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1034.0s)]
*  Lebanon itself, it must be said, is teetering near failed state status as it is. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1039.0s)]
*  And when something like this happened, it was really quite shocking to the country, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1043.0s)]
*  but also, as Nasrallah admitted, to Hezbollah itself. It has been deeply penetrated. It's clear. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1049.0s)]
*  That was also the conclusion after a senior Hezbollah military chief was assassinated in a Beirut suburb last summer. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1054.0s)]
*  And now you've seen this. It gives them pause in terms of what sort of response they would do. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1060.0s)]
*  Is this in fact an opening salvo, the pushing of buttons, as you said, to an Israeli incursion perhaps [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1066.0s)]
*  where they would want to push Hezbollah forces back sufficiently that they feel like they have a safe zone? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1072.0s)]
*  All of this is open for question, as is the extent to which Israel is sharing any information with the United States. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1078.0s)]
*  It's a very dangerous time for a lot of the parties involved. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1084.0s)]
*  And the U.S. is going to be inevitably drawn into this if the escalation gets much bigger. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1088.0s)]
*  It's got a large footprint now militarily in the greater area. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1092.0s)]
*  There are a lot of these Iranian-linked Axis of Resistance countries that are staying involved, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1096.0s)]
*  the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, obviously very weakened, as well as forces based in Syria and Iraq. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1100.0s)]
*  So this can all mushroom really badly. And we mentioned earlier the UN, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1108.0s)]
*  perhaps there will be some useful sideline discussions that take place at the UN during that gathering of leaders there. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1113.0s)]
*  One hopes that the U.S. and the Israelis will be sharing more information for starters. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1120.0s)]
*  And then some sort of movement towards really tamping this down because this is what the UN should be set up for. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1126.0s)]
*  This is what the U.S. has been striving and says it's striving to do for the last couple of months. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1132.0s)]
*  Something has to happen soon because this had ripple effects really across the world, Carla, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1136.0s)]
*  and for the reasons you mentioned in terms of the new front open in this war, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1141.0s)]
*  as well as the ongoing concerns about what a Mideast Expanded War will be. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1146.0s)]
*  We've talked about this and we talked about this after the Haniya assassination during Possesion's inauguration. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1150.0s)]
*  Is Iran going to retaliate? Is it going to tell its proxies to retaliate? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1155.0s)]
*  It seems like we're there. And I will say that the Americans moved forces into the region to deter and in defense of a longtime ally, Israel. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1159.0s)]
*  But boy, Tony Blinken in the region this week after these pagers started exploding, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1169.0s)]
*  he sounded like a man who did not know what was going on and had no – he was in there trying to move this hostage for ceasefire deal forward [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1174.0s)]
*  and just had this sense of just cannot control an ally that we're providing all this military support for. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1184.0s)]
*  It's just got to be extraordinarily frustrating and extraordinarily frightening. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1190.0s)]
*  Well, Bob, with so many leaders gathered in New York for UNGA, officials are maximizing their time [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1194.0s)]
*  and at least trying to leverage their carbon footprints. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1200.0s)]
*  So there are going to be a lot of big jets lined up there with all those leaders. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1205.0s)]
*  I like that reference, leveraging your carbon footprint. It should be a new way of dealing with symmetry. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1209.0s)]
*  So there are going to be a host of side meetings and this Saturday in Wilmington, Delaware, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1214.0s)]
*  President Biden is going to host a Quad Leaders Summit with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Alpines, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1220.0s)]
*  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1227.0s)]
*  So for Biden and Kishida, this is their final meeting of the so-called Quad. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1233.0s)]
*  And what are you looking for in this discussion, not to mention the fact that they get to experience Wilmington, Delaware? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1238.0s)]
*  Yes. And I'll leave that part aside and mention what could be the crux of their discussions, which is, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1244.0s)]
*  first, it is significant that half of the leadership of this are going to be moving on shortly, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1250.0s)]
*  very shortly, Kishida at the end of the month, Biden in January. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1255.0s)]
*  And I'll be looking for, as one often does with these Quad's ever since it was set up, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1259.0s)]
*  what are the references to China? Because it's the country that dare not speak its name at these summits, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1264.0s)]
*  but in fact, it's hovering over all of this. Whether you want to consider the setting up of a Quad, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1269.0s)]
*  the kind of partial counterpart to the Belt and Road Initiative of China, which is incredibly ambitious [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1274.0s)]
*  and in some ways really effective worldwide network that China has been trying to set up to expand its influence [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1279.0s)]
*  and soft and hard power, as the case may be. Or is it also a military counterpoint, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1285.0s)]
*  at least in terms of them expanding maritime cooperation, for example, which has been discussed at these meetings? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1291.0s)]
*  The Quad did take on a separate role and sort of a new frontier under COVID in terms of sharing information [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1296.0s)]
*  about vaccines, about health and health infrastructure, which I think is a good use for this Quad. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1302.0s)]
*  And these are four consequential countries that bring a lot to the table [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1307.0s)]
*  and have a lot of insights from different perspectives into what is going on with China. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1312.0s)]
*  How much of a threat is percolating in the South China Sea, for example, between China and the Philippines, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1317.0s)]
*  one of the latest big issues, and what sort of threats are emerging or might be continuing to emerge in Taiwan? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1322.0s)]
*  Again, these countries can bring different insights into that. So it's significant that they're meeting ahead of the UN summit [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1328.0s)]
*  that they're going to have two of their key members moving on and just sort of establishing basic practices [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1335.0s)]
*  that can survive these administrations. By all indications, if there was an incoming Trump administration, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1343.0s)]
*  they would be behind the Quad. They were behind the initial Quad setting up and obviously the same with Japan. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1348.0s)]
*  So this has traction. It seems to be an organization that tries to have some tangible practical coordination [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1353.0s)]
*  going on in maritime areas and supply chain securing and so forth. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1358.0s)]
*  And so will this Quad mention China as something that they are concerned about, that they have under control? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1363.0s)]
*  That'll be interesting to me. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1368.0s)]
*  Well, particularly because the Chinese are particularly aggressive with what they're doing with the Philippines [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1373.0s)]
*  ramming ships and all of that has been going on. But at the same time, they've always insisted that this isn't all about China. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1378.0s)]
*  It's all pretty much about China, isn't it? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1383.0s)]
*  So wouldn't Biden want on his way out to have a more clarion statement about this? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1388.0s)]
*  Or is he going softly, softly on China these days? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1393.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think he would like to. On the one hand, the US, as we've discussed before, has had many, many stepped up [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1398.0s)]
*  contacts with China, which in general is a good thing despite all of the differences in their antagonisms. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1403.0s)]
*  And the US does not want to needlessly provoke China when they don't have to. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1408.0s)]
*  Having this meeting in and of itself certainly gets China's attention. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1413.0s)]
*  And I think they all realize that. But by the same token, I think if they're concerned about Chinese assertiveness, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1418.0s)]
*  especially again, in this Philippines front, which is not going away, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1423.0s)]
*  they might want to just reinforce their priors on that in terms of a big swath of the sea that they're going to be [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1428.0s)]
*  China claims as its own, which the rest of the world does not. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1433.0s)]
*  And the free and fair navigation of ocean waters, these sort of principles that have been stated again and again, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1438.0s)]
*  I think they're going to want to state that again. And China is going to be one of the intended targets for that message. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1443.0s)]
*  And so one of the really strange things is not only is the Japanese leader on his way out [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1448.0s)]
*  and the American leader on his way out, there is a possibility that the Australian leader could be on his way out as well, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1453.0s)]
*  which would then leave- [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1458.0s)]
*  Next year, at the end of next year. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1463.0s)]
*  Yeah, then leave Modi the only one standing in the Quad. And Modi is a guy who plays all sides against the middle. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1465.0s)]
*  So I'm not sure that the Quad really will survive that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1470.0s)]
*  Modi is in the Quad, but he's also always cozying up to the Russians. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1475.0s)]
*  He's not probably a great defender of Western values, is he? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1480.0s)]
*  He likes to be in the room, let's say. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1483.0s)]
*  We all like to be in the room, Bob. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1486.0s)]
*  And he's had his issues. India certainly has had its border issues with China, which are still percolating, for example. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1489.0s)]
*  They are co-members of the BRICS group too, which is going to have a meeting next month. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1496.0s)]
*  But at the same time, Modi likes to hold a lot of cards. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1501.0s)]
*  And I think he does have a good relationship with the United States. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1505.0s)]
*  And whether or not it will be a Harris or Trump administration will likely continue to have a good relationship with the United States. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1508.0s)]
*  So that relationship alone, I think, would keep him in Quad structures and perhaps promising to use his leverage with the so-called global south and connections with Russia to potentially be serviceable. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1513.0s)]
*  I don't know. You raise a really good question. India has seen this overall as useful. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1528.0s)]
*  And Modi himself took a little bit of an electoral setback and has had to deal with a bit more of voices who are not all singing in unison behind him in his own country. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1533.0s)]
*  So I think this is a meeting that serves him well. Modi is going to have an interesting week at the UN. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1542.0s)]
*  It will be interesting to watch him, whether or not, for example, he meets with the new Bangladeshi interim leader, Mohammed Yunus, who we talked about. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1547.0s)]
*  Or he is also supposed to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the UN. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1554.0s)]
*  So he's worth watching, both beginning with the Quad and through UNGA week. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1558.0s)]
*  Well, Carla, it's the time of the podcast to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1563.0s)]
*  This is the figure that listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's Instagram story. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1568.0s)]
*  This week, Carla, our audience selected Putin orders up to 180,000 more troops. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1575.0s)]
*  Why is this figure of the week getting attention? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1581.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, why did they not choose Shogun winning the most amnesty? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1585.0s)]
*  Unfathomable. Don't know. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1589.0s)]
*  Unfathomable. They exist to frustrate me. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1591.0s)]
*  Clearly going to have to start lobbying all of my friends and all the people who watch as much television as I do to be voting. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1594.0s)]
*  So it's important to note that the Kremlin has announced that it wants 180,000 more troops, but it also hasn't decided to draft them, at least for now. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1602.0s)]
*  And that raises a host of questions, including whether and how they're going to pull that increase off. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1613.0s)]
*  So when the Kremlin instituted what it called a partial mobilization in September and October of 2022, calling up 300,000 reservists and former soldiers, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1619.0s)]
*  remember there were just protests and recruitment offices were attacked and tens of thousands of draft age men fled the country. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1629.0s)]
*  Some border crossings had to be closed. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1637.0s)]
*  So this is a pretty sensitive issue here. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1639.0s)]
*  And there are a lot of people who are suggesting they're not going to get to 180,000 without having a mobilization. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1643.0s)]
*  So are they really going to get to 180,000? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1650.0s)]
*  The way Putin has filled the ranks mainly since Ukraine started is by paying big bonuses. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1653.0s)]
*  And emptying out the prisons. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1659.0s)]
*  And emptying out the prisons. And both of those are probably not sustainable models. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1661.0s)]
*  So why are they talking about 180,000? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1666.0s)]
*  If they were to get it, they would have the largest active duty combat military or the largest number of active duty forces in the world. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1670.0s)]
*  Why does he think he needs that? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1678.0s)]
*  I think it's not a sign of strength. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1680.0s)]
*  It's an indication that the tough battles they're currently fighting, that very long front in eastern Ukraine, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1683.0s)]
*  and the fact that they haven't been able to marshal enough troops to push the Ukrainians out of Korsk, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1690.0s)]
*  the first time Russian territory has been taken since World War II, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1696.0s)]
*  and an assessment that the war is likely to grind on for quite a bit longer. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1700.0s)]
*  I don't think this is an admission of strength. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1705.0s)]
*  It also could be posturing or it could be contingency planning. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1708.0s)]
*  They're betting that perhaps Trump will win and then they won't have to fulfill that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1712.0s)]
*  We're talking about that number in December after the US election. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1717.0s)]
*  Every analyst basically says they can't get there without a mobilization. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1721.0s)]
*  And I think that's just politically unsustainable for him. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1725.0s)]
*  And certainly the number one thing he has done up until now is insulate the Russian public from the cost of this war. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1728.0s)]
*  To great success by many accounts. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1735.0s)]
*  And so I think it's an admission of weakness on their part. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1737.0s)]
*  It has been presented in a lot of the coverage as a sign of, look, they're going to have this biggest army in the world. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1741.0s)]
*  I'm reading it as weakness. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1747.0s)]
*  But there is another grim thought to keep in mind. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1749.0s)]
*  As hard as this is for Russia, it still has a population more than three times that of Ukraine. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1751.0s)]
*  But on the other hand, Ukrainians have a much bigger reason to fight than the Russians do. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1756.0s)]
*  It's the survival of their own country, which is why they can talk about mobilization in the Russians camp. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1761.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that troop numbers are a concern on the Ukrainian side. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1767.0s)]
*  Certainly if Russia was able to muster up anything close to this figure, it would be a real area of concern. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1771.0s)]
*  We've talked before about Ukrainians are recycling and training up people who are typically older, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1776.0s)]
*  who are going into repeat battle duty and are really burned out. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1783.0s)]
*  And it's having a real toll. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1787.0s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons behind some of their defeats in the Donbas of the past several months. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1789.0s)]
*  But at the same time, Russia has also thrown as many projectiles as it can at Ukraine, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1794.0s)]
*  and by all signs, is going to continue to do that. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1799.0s)]
*  So yeah, I think it is worth looking at whether or not behind the Russian bravado and everything else, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1802.0s)]
*  there is a weakness there that is not going to be filled and mobilization is not going to be in the cards for them. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1808.0s)]
*  And it is also a sign of just how many people are being killed. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1814.0s)]
*  This is just a real grinding, grinding war. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1818.0s)]
*  The Brits are estimating that the Russian casualty rate is about a thousand or more a day right now. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1823.0s)]
*  And neither side is giving actual numbers, but this is a grinding, horrible, horrible war. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lmDkVZ0hA&t=1829.0s)]
