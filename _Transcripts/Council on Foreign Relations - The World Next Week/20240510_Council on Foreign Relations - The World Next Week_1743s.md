# Israel’s Rafah Plans, Greece and Turkey Boost Diplomacy, Cannes Festival Unveils New Films, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c)
*  In the coming week, Israel's operation in Ra'afa draws global attention. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=0.0s)]
*  Turkish President Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Mitsotakis meet in Ankara. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=5.0s)]
*  And the Cannes Film Festival premieres dozens of new movies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=9.0s)]
*  It's May 9th, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=13.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=27.0s)]
*  And I'm Carl Anne Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=28.0s)]
*  Bablet started Ra'afa. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=30.0s)]
*  This isn't at least yet the full assault that the Israelis have been threatening [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=32.0s)]
*  and that Washington has been warning against. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=36.0s)]
*  Still, since Israel began this newest military operation in eastern Ra'afa [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=39.0s)]
*  and took full control of the border crossing with Egypt, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=44.0s)]
*  more than 100,000 Gazans have been displaced [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=47.0s)]
*  and vital aid deliveries have been brought to its standstill. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=50.0s)]
*  And at the same time, Hamas and Israeli delegations, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=53.0s)]
*  as well as US Egyptian and Qatari representatives are in Cairo for ceasefire talks. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=56.0s)]
*  And for the first time, President Biden has suspended an aid delivery to Israel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=60.0s)]
*  Are we in a cluster to a ceasefire for hostages deal? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=66.0s)]
*  And what do you think the impact of this US pressure is having on Israeli military decisions? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, Carla, the latter of those questions is the one that's particularly intriguing at this moment in time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=75.0s)]
*  But just to kind of recap the things you mentioned, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=80.0s)]
*  it seems like such a long time ago that we had news of Hamas accepting the ceasefire proposal, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=83.0s)]
*  which was only the start of this week. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=88.0s)]
*  That in turn turned out to be a very transitory moment [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=90.0s)]
*  because it was a deal that they saw that Israelis had said was a bit watered down [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=93.0s)]
*  and was not acceptable to them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=98.0s)]
*  And then Israel in turn moved to ratchet up the pressure [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=100.0s)]
*  and mount what they called a limited operation in Ra'afa. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=104.0s)]
*  But then you had the ongoing turning up of the pressure from US officials [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=107.0s)]
*  who have been very concerned about the use of heavy US weapons for what they call offensive operations. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=112.0s)]
*  And so this announcement, first it was the report ultimately confirmed by administration officials [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=118.0s)]
*  that they were holding off on shipping certain very heavy armaments. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=124.0s)]
*  But then it was President Biden himself saying on CNN [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=129.0s)]
*  that the US would halt shipment of offensive weapons that have been used to kill civilians in Gaza [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=132.0s)]
*  if the Israelis move ahead with a ground invasion of Ra'afa. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=138.0s)]
*  And Biden was quick to say that the US would continue to help Israel with defensive weapons [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=141.0s)]
*  such as the Iron Dome anti-missile system and components. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=146.0s)]
*  But was trying to draw a line and said Israel had not yet crossed what he called a red line on the Ra'afa invasion, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=150.0s)]
*  but he was basically laying out markers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=156.0s)]
*  And it caused some really sharp reactions, especially from the very right-wing element of the Israeli coalition, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=158.0s)]
*  referred to it I believe as a blockade, one of the comments that came from them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=165.0s)]
*  So you have this other first while very strong allies obviously, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=170.0s)]
*  but the US is laying out some markers here because of real alarm at what is transpiring in Ra'afa. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=173.0s)]
*  And reports are saying minimally a million, maybe up to 1.4 million Palestinians civilians are in this area [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=180.0s)]
*  and could be affected. And there are a few places for them to go that are safe. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=189.0s)]
*  There have been designated humanitarian areas, but a few feel safe in it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=192.0s)]
*  Even if they are able to cluster there, the ability to get them food and fuel and other necessary items is limited. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=197.0s)]
*  The ability to get supplies into Gaza has been constrained. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=205.0s)]
*  There's been on again, off again reports of border closures. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=208.0s)]
*  And one of the things that's coming out in this report, Carla, is the US clearly does not have confidence [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=211.0s)]
*  that the Israelis have a plan for how to deal with the humanitarian fallout from a sustained attack [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=216.0s)]
*  on what the Israelis say are some of the last major Hamas positions in Gaza in this area around Ra'afa. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=223.0s)]
*  And there's lots of good reporting on this circumstance playing out in Ra'afa. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=230.0s)]
*  I would note we have a new piece up on CFR.org with a map detailing where Gaza civilians can go [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=234.0s)]
*  and where the military operations are playing out. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=240.0s)]
*  So things are really coming to a head. We should say as we always do when we tape this podcast, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=243.0s)]
*  some of the things we say could be overtaken by the time this airs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=247.0s)]
*  But the way things are looking right now, there's a lot of pressure on Israel to be restrained [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=250.0s)]
*  at the very least offer a more clear-cut humanitarian plan. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=254.0s)]
*  While, as you say, these talks continue and maybe there's some sort of leverage being sought [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=258.0s)]
*  that could help influence these talks. It's not clear, but the talks are continuing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=263.0s)]
*  We could end up this week with a real escalation or maybe momentum towards a ceasefire at this point. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=268.0s)]
*  The way things have transpired, you could be almost ready for anything on that scale of things, Carla. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=274.0s)]
*  So we had a media briefing with the council yesterday with two of our experts, Elliot Abrams [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=279.0s)]
*  and Stephen Cook, and both of them were very skeptical at the possibility of a ceasefire [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=286.0s)]
*  for hostages agreement. And both of them believed that the Israelis were going to push into Ra'afa, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=292.0s)]
*  even with the American pressure. They were arguing on the ceasefire front that Hamas [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=300.0s)]
*  and the Israelis just want something different. Hamas wants a complete end to Israeli military action. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=305.0s)]
*  And the Israelis want to go for it until Hamas is wiped out. It's just unimaginable they could possibly [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=313.0s)]
*  come to an agreement, even though the administration keeps saying we're in a delicate moment, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=320.0s)]
*  but that they believe it's very hard to tell whether that's happy talk on their part or they're just being wishful. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=324.0s)]
*  Do you have any sense that there's a possibility for a deal here? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=330.0s)]
*  I would say, and it's only a sense, it's not a special intel, but first of all, I would commend that meeting [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=334.0s)]
*  that you mentioned that you moderated yesterday, the media briefing with Stephen and Elliot, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=339.0s)]
*  just because it kind of walked through certainly what the calculations are on both sides and how tough this is, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=343.0s)]
*  this moment is. Can they agree on a pause that doesn't include a sustained follow-up pause, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=350.0s)]
*  which is what Hamas wants? The Israelis really do want the hostage release and seem to have been willing to accept [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=355.0s)]
*  a certain limited, at least six weeks or so pause. Is there a window? Is there daylight for both sides to agree on [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=362.0s)]
*  just, let's say, a six week option? Possibly. I'm not sure. It's very uncertain whether they're trying to swing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=368.0s)]
*  for the fences, so to speak, or will accept something more modest. I don't know the dynamic on either side. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=375.0s)]
*  What we've certainly seen in public dynamic with the US pressure on the Israelis, we don't know what kind of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=381.0s)]
*  pressure Hamas is facing, say, from some of its interlocutors in Qatar, for example, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=385.0s)]
*  and whether or not that's going to work. And you have, at the end of the day, as we've talked about many times before, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=390.0s)]
*  this is an existential struggle. The Israelis want to wipe out Hamas. They don't want this group to exist anymore [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=395.0s)]
*  based on what they did on October 7th. They see them as being able to reconstitute themselves with any sort of a lengthy pause [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=402.0s)]
*  that does not include the eradication of the group or the expunging of them from Gaza. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=409.0s)]
*  And Hamas does not want to write into an agreement its own extermination. In trying to finesse that seems like it's really tough. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=414.0s)]
*  So I guess my sense, based on your question, Carla, is that it seems very dubious, but at the same time, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=421.0s)]
*  it's hard to see the Israelis going with a full-fledged ground offensive given what's now transpiring in terms of US pressure [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=428.0s)]
*  and global pressure too, although these rows have said we are listening to no one when it comes to our self-defense. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=434.0s)]
*  And finally, why do you think this is we've come to this point for Biden? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=440.0s)]
*  I mean, more than 34,000 people killed in Gaza since this offensive began. Why now for Biden? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=445.0s)]
*  What is it about Rafa in particular that has led Biden to take this step that many people have been saying, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=453.0s)]
*  condition the aid, condition the aid, there are too many civilians being killed? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=460.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think some of it might be just the duration of this. As was pointed out in your media call yesterday, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=463.0s)]
*  this is the longest sustained military conflict the Israelis have ever had. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=469.0s)]
*  And it's brought about so many new sorts of things, including the sustained impact on a civilian population. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=473.0s)]
*  And I think cumulatively what US officials have seen transpiring, the way it's gotten into US politics, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=479.0s)]
*  certainly we've seen it play out on US campuses, college campuses with student protests, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=486.0s)]
*  and calling for divestment even of anything that supports Israel or the Israeli military campaign. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=491.0s)]
*  That's not influencing necessarily the administration, but I think it's a collective sense [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=498.0s)]
*  and a growing number of members of the Democratic Party that are upset about what's happening [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=502.0s)]
*  and what the Israelis seem to be intent on doing despite the ongoing ports of real concerns, including famine. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=507.0s)]
*  You had the US head of the World Food Program, Cindy McCain, talking about famine in effect. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=515.0s)]
*  John McCain's widow. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=521.0s)]
*  John McCain's widow mentioning in northern Gaza that they are seeing signs of famine, for example. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=522.0s)]
*  And so I think it's a bunch of these types of developments. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=529.0s)]
*  Now, we should also keep in mind Biden has been, as you indicated, has been staunchly supportive of Israel throughout this campaign. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=532.0s)]
*  There's also reports this week that the administration is holding off on turning in what was expected to be the report [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=539.0s)]
*  on whether Israel had violated US law and whether or not they would not be submitting it to Congress. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=545.0s)]
*  And that also could have an effect on US legally being able to continue sending aid to Israel. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=551.0s)]
*  But the president has lots of levers to support Israel, just like we saw the president using these levers to support Ukraine [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=557.0s)]
*  while there was a congressional impasse. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=562.0s)]
*  And I think to your question, Karla, you just reached a point of grave concern about what was going on on a humanitarian front [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=564.0s)]
*  and what RAFA means because there is no place for the Palestinians in RAFA to go at this point. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=572.0s)]
*  They have been moved all around Gaza, Egypt and Jordan. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=578.0s)]
*  They're by countries are not going to accept them. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=582.0s)]
*  You know, they are bordered on one area by the Mediterranean Sea. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=585.0s)]
*  There are these humanitarian areas that are seen as precarious, to say the least. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=588.0s)]
*  There's just too many signs that this could be a real catastrophe on a humanitarian front. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=593.0s)]
*  And I think they just kind of reached a limit. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=598.0s)]
*  An even greater catastrophe. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=600.0s)]
*  Bob, let's head to Ankara, Turkey, not the world's most interesting city, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=603.0s)]
*  where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is hosting Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis for a meeting next Monday, May 13th. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=608.0s)]
*  These two countries really don't like each other. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=616.0s)]
*  They have a lot of unresolved disputes, multiple threats of war, and they're going to have a high-level meeting. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=619.0s)]
*  And this is possibly could be the start of a new chapter between two NATO allies that really I don't think you could really call them allies. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=625.0s)]
*  Why are Greece and Turkey trying to mend their relationship right now? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=635.0s)]
*  Well, certainly you can't find two more antagonistic NATO members than Greece and Turkey. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=639.0s)]
*  But I do think there's something to be said for the personal dynamic between the Prime Minister Mitsotakis and President Erdogan. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=645.0s)]
*  So they're meeting in Ankara, and I think they have a bit of momentum. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=655.0s)]
*  They met in Athens. The previous meeting was in Athens. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=658.0s)]
*  And they have been sort of dealing with some of the low-hanging fruit type issues, as they say in diplomatic parlance, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=661.0s)]
*  in terms of trying to build confidence measures, maintaining military lines of unification, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=667.0s)]
*  even fostering some trade deals, doing the things that helps both sides feel like, hey, you know, we can work together. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=673.0s)]
*  It doesn't all have to be shouting at each other. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=680.0s)]
*  They have an enormous number of issues of contention, certainly. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=682.0s)]
*  And there were just recent reminders of that in terms of on the one hand, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=686.0s)]
*  you had President Erdogan formally reopening a former Byzantine-era church as a mosque just in the past week. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=691.0s)]
*  And the Greeks have criticized that and called on Turkey to protect it as a UN World Heritage Site. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=697.0s)]
*  You have on the side of the Turks being upset at the Greek move to declare two new marine parks, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=703.0s)]
*  one in the Aegean Sea and the other in the Ionian Sea, in contested waters, basically. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=711.0s)]
*  The one in the Aegean Sea, for example, spans some deserted islands and islets that are north of Crete, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=716.0s)]
*  but near the peninsula of the Turkish western Mughla province. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=721.0s)]
*  And so when you declare a marine park, you set aside space for ecological sustainability and so forth. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=725.0s)]
*  And the Turks see that as a violation of their sovereignty. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=732.0s)]
*  There are many other issues involving this region and the Eastern Mediterranean in general, especially over energy claims. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=735.0s)]
*  And I think this meeting in Ankara is a chance to both sort of talk about areas [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=742.0s)]
*  where they can continue to try to work cooperatively, collaboratively together, perhaps, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=747.0s)]
*  but also to sort of dial down the temperature on the areas of friction. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=751.0s)]
*  I don't know what they're going to be able to say about smoothing over the concerns over the marine park. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=755.0s)]
*  That seems like an issue that the Greeks are not going to dial back necessarily. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=760.0s)]
*  But maybe it's just the fact of continuing to talk, continuing to create assurances on both sides [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=764.0s)]
*  that what they're doing is not about trying to one-up the other side or make claims against the other side, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=770.0s)]
*  but is something different. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=777.0s)]
*  There are disputes over Cyprus. It's now 50 years since the division of Cyprus, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=779.0s)]
*  and you have Northern Cyprus that's only recognized by Turkey, for example. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=783.0s)]
*  The rest of Cyprus is in the EU. That was 20 years ago that that happened. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=787.0s)]
*  And so at the same time, the two countries have said, we have things we can talk about [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=791.0s)]
*  and maybe some positions we can share vis-à-vis what's going on in the Middle East, what's going on in Ukraine, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=796.0s)]
*  how we can possibly be a voice even in NATO. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=802.0s)]
*  So it's going to be very intriguing. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=805.0s)]
*  I think this meeting is occurring at a very interesting time where there's just so much bad news [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=807.0s)]
*  and antagonism going on. You have two countries, traditionally at loggerheads, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=812.0s)]
*  trying to kind of forge ahead and kind of make common cause here, Carla. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=816.0s)]
*  So this basically began in 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=820.0s)]
*  Is it somehow linked to it, to the Russian invasion, this desire to – is it one more NATO drawing together impulse? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=827.0s)]
*  I don't think you can rule some elements of that out. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=835.0s)]
*  I think it's the combination of these two leaders kind of sort of taking stock of what was happening [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=839.0s)]
*  and deciding we have an opportunity here, we have a chance here to kind of smooth over some things. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=845.0s)]
*  They had both, by the way, in early 2023 reached deals with the United States for fighter jets, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=850.0s)]
*  and that had reached concern that they were sort of dial up their posturing against each other. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=856.0s)]
*  And so I think after the fighter jet deal, I think they saw a real need to like sort of turn down the temperature [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=861.0s)]
*  to kind of talk with each other, to kind of indicate that they are not about trying to make [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=868.0s)]
*  territorial gains using the military force, but in fact have ways that they can use diplomacy, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=872.0s)]
*  and that the last thing that part of the world needs is another conflict while the Ukraine one is playing out. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=878.0s)]
*  And yes, Ukraine is a conflict that has really focused the attention of NATO. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=883.0s)]
*  NATO certainly has its frictions on some things, but I think you can't rule that out. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=886.0s)]
*  Turkey has tried to be a broker in that front, as we know. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=890.0s)]
*  Certainly it has a line to Russia that other countries don't have. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=893.0s)]
*  So does Greece in a number of ways, partly through the ties of sort of culture and religion going way back. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=897.0s)]
*  And so I think we should watch this space a little bit more and just see what they're able to do [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=903.0s)]
*  both in their own bilateral relationship as well as what they might provide in terms of another voice, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=908.0s)]
*  another perspective on the Ukraine front or helping shore up that part of NATO. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=913.0s)]
*  We certainly spent a lot of time talking about the Nordic part of NATO, but this is an interesting other side of NATO. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=918.0s)]
*  But Carla, I want to take us to the French Riviera, because on the French Riviera next Tuesday is the start of the 77th Cannes Film Festival. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=922.0s)]
*  Now, every year at Cannes, there are big auteurs and directors and stars who are making great strides, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=930.0s)]
*  who are trying to come out with something new and provocative or exciting. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=937.0s)]
*  One of the big ones this year is Francis Ford Coppola. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=941.0s)]
*  George Lucas is also going to be there, Meryl Streep, and a number of others who were vying for the coveted Palme d'Or, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=943.0s)]
*  the grand prize for the best film. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=950.0s)]
*  But there are also some disruptions that are playing out on the sidelines, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=953.0s)]
*  including maybe even some workers' strikes that could disrupt things. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=957.0s)]
*  But Carla, what should we be focusing on as this springtime, this annual springtime occasion kind of plays out on the Riviera? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=960.0s)]
*  Well, my usual envy for the beautiful people walking the red carpet in Cannes has been somewhat tempered by pictures from the Met Gala. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=968.0s)]
*  When I saw Kim Kardashian in that, how can she breathe waist cinching corset? Did you see those pictures? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=976.0s)]
*  And then there was South African singer Tyla, who had to be carried up the museum steps. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=983.0s)]
*  Maybe it's not as fun to get dressed up for these galas as I always thought it might be. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=988.0s)]
*  That said, this is quite the party for people who are obsessed with films like I am. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=994.0s)]
*  This is the world's largest film festival. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=998.0s)]
*  Last year, eight of the movies showcased there earned Oscar nominations, including three for Best Picture, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1001.0s)]
*  Anatomy of Fall, The Zone of Interest, and Killers of the Flower Moon. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1006.0s)]
*  This year, there are 22 competing selections for the big award, the Palme d'Or. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1010.0s)]
*  And there are other movies that are not in competition, but they also get a big rollout at the festival because everybody's going to be paying attention to it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1014.0s)]
*  And interestingly enough, a lot of them are kept under wraps until the festival. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1021.0s)]
*  Part of it has to do with the incredibly complex and arcane rules of it. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1025.0s)]
*  And part of it is just because everybody's watching. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1028.0s)]
*  So if you look at the list of movies that are going to be rolled out, some of them, they don't even have trailers yet. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1031.0s)]
*  So you just have to sort of read the tea leaves and what the directors said that their moves are going to be about. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1037.0s)]
*  And while the list includes the serious and the cerebral, they also happily embrace pop culture. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1043.0s)]
*  So this year, Greta Gerwig, who is both cerebral and pop of Barbie fame, is going to serve as the jury president. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1049.0s)]
*  George Lucas of Star Wars, as well as Meryl Streep, will both receive honorary Palme d'Or for their lifetime achievements. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1056.0s)]
*  And as for the films, both on and off the list, people are buzzing about one of the big rollouts, but not up for an award is Furiosa, a Mad Max saga. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1063.0s)]
*  And on the list of competitors, those getting a lot of buzz, and I'm not going to go through all 22. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1073.0s)]
*  The Greek filmmaker, Yorgos Lanthimos, who was nominated for Best Director for Poor Things, which was also nominated for Best Picture, is releasing something called Kinds of Kindness. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1078.0s)]
*  And this stars this year's best actress winner, Emma Stone, along with Willem Dafoe and Jesse Plemons and a lot of other major names. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1088.0s)]
*  And nobody is doing a very good job of describing it. It's supposedly a three part sci-fi anthology. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1095.0s)]
*  The trailer is really worth looking at. It's completely noir, completely incomprehensible. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1101.0s)]
*  But the track is Sweet Dreams by the Eurythmics, which makes it worth watching multiple times, which I have done. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1105.0s)]
*  Then there's Megalopolis. This is the first film directed by Francis Ford Coppola to be released in 13 years. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1111.0s)]
*  He couldn't find backers for it, so he self-financed for a reported $120 million. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1117.0s)]
*  Vogue described it as, quote, a debauched and cautionary tale about America's future. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1122.0s)]
*  And those few people who have been able to see it so far have given decidedly mixed responses. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1128.0s)]
*  Some have been episodic, others have said it's a complete disaster. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1133.0s)]
*  And so we'll see what happens when it rolls out at Cannes. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1137.0s)]
*  Also getting a lot of buzz is The Apprentice, directed by Iranian-Danish filmmaker Ali Abbasi. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1141.0s)]
*  And it's a biopic about Donald Trump's rise to power in the 1970s under the tutelage of Roy Cohen. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1147.0s)]
*  And Roy Cohen is played by Succession's Jeremy Strong. I think that's great casting. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1153.0s)]
*  And I am completely intrigued by Amelia Paris by French director Jacques Odillard, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1158.0s)]
*  who won the Palme d'Or a decade ago for D'Pont, a story about a Tamil warrior who emigrated to France. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1164.0s)]
*  This is a very different story. It stars Selena Gomez, Zoe Saldana, Edgar Ramirez. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1170.0s)]
*  And it's a musical and a crime story about a Mexican drug cartel leader who wants to get out of the business and have sex reassignment surgery. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1176.0s)]
*  Really a complex story, but it just also sounds absolutely fascinating. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1184.0s)]
*  And if you're into horror movies, there's something called The Shrouds from Canadian director and screenwriter and master of horror, David Cronenberg, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1189.0s)]
*  on a cast including Diane Kruger and Guy Pearce. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1198.0s)]
*  And this is a story of a businessman who's supposed to destroy about the death of his wife. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1201.0s)]
*  And he invents a new technology that allows people to monitor their dead loved ones in their shrouds. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1207.0s)]
*  So there's a lot to watch there. And you mentioned, Bob, something else we're going to be watching for, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1212.0s)]
*  which is the potential of a strike, which has been called by 200 freelance festival workers. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1217.0s)]
*  And they are members of this collective that is called Sous les Ecrans, L'Aideche, which means poverty behind the scenes. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1223.0s)]
*  And these freelance workers like gig economy workers don't have great benefits, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1229.0s)]
*  although in France they've got better benefits than a lot of people in the United States. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1235.0s)]
*  And they're very worried because the French government is threatening to cut back on their still limited benefits. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1239.0s)]
*  Now, what they said is that they have no intention of shutting down the festival. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1247.0s)]
*  They only want to disturb the proceedings. And it's not clear how much 200 freelance festival workers have, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1251.0s)]
*  although as of Wednesday they seem to be gathering wider support. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1257.0s)]
*  The Audiovisual and Cinema Professionals branch of France's major labor union, the CGT, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1261.0s)]
*  went on Instagram to express solidarity, but so far they haven't said what exactly they're going to do. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1266.0s)]
*  So watch that space. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1271.0s)]
*  Wow. So sci-fi, horror, labor disputes. It's quite a handful. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1273.0s)]
*  I'm not sure where to look first, but I am interested in the Megalopolis feedback or fallout, as it were, on that movie in particular, Carla. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1279.0s)]
*  It does sound like another packed can lineup. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1286.0s)]
*  I am struck by, we love to talk about the Academy Awards every year and also the internationalization of the Academy Awards. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1289.0s)]
*  It does seem like a lot of American names and voices that you were citing there in the rundown. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1297.0s)]
*  So big American presence at Cannes, or maybe it's just the internationalization of Cannes from another direction. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1301.0s)]
*  Okay. Maybe I've had a bias here. There are plenty of other foreign movies that I should have gone into, but these are, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1308.0s)]
*  Jorgos Lentini, Mrs. Greek, and we've got French and we've got Canadian and we've got- [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1315.0s)]
*  Yeah, and they're all collaborating internationally. So it sounds like it's kind of a mashup from both directions. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1321.0s)]
*  And we have a big market there. But I think one of the things that really struck me about this is there's a wide variety here, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1326.0s)]
*  but it also seems like there's a very pop appeal to a lot of these things here, whether musicals and horror and The Apprentice. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1333.0s)]
*  So I don't know if it's The Times or whatever. I'm not sure that's fun, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1344.0s)]
*  but certainly people want to go into movie theaters and really have an experience. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1349.0s)]
*  And a lot of these movies look like experience movie. Megalopolis, some of the things that I've been reading, people are anxious. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1353.0s)]
*  They're anxious. They really are rooting for Francis Ford Coppola. They want him to have a big win here, if not winning the Pom-Dora. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1360.0s)]
*  They want this to be a good movie because he's invested so much of his money and because this is sort of a crowning moment in his career. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1367.0s)]
*  And there's a real fear that he potentially is going to crash and burn. I'm rooting for him. I think he's just a fabulous filmmaker. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1374.0s)]
*  So fingers crossed that it's going to be the Repsodic triumph rather than a lot of people were worried. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1382.0s)]
*  It took him a long time to pull Apocalypse Now together. Let's hope it's that sort of a triumph. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1389.0s)]
*  All right. Well, I need to wrench us back into the real world now for the audience figure of the week portion of the podcast, Carla. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1394.0s)]
*  This is where our listeners vote every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore orgs Instagram story for a figure. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1402.0s)]
*  And they chose this week Putin, as in Putin orders nuclear weapons drill. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1410.0s)]
*  So what is going on with this latest turn of brinkstenship by the Russian president? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1416.0s)]
*  Well, let us hope that this is just more Putin posturing and saber rattling. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1423.0s)]
*  This announcement of a nuclear drill is the first one they've done. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1429.0s)]
*  And it is Russia's most explicit warning. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1435.0s)]
*  And it's more than two year invasion of Ukraine that implies that it could use tactical nuclear weapons. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1438.0s)]
*  But from the start of the Ukraine conflict, you know, that's always been the fear that he could do something truly crazy and drop a small nuclear weapon on Ukraine. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1444.0s)]
*  It's been such a fear that, frankly, the United States and a lot of NATO members have been self deterring. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1452.0s)]
*  And you recall, we've talked about this many times. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1458.0s)]
*  We're not going to send Patriots. We're not going to send F-16s. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1461.0s)]
*  We're not going to send attack them because there's some unknown red line of escalation from the West side that could provoke Putin into doing something that really truly terrifying. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1464.0s)]
*  And time after time, of course, the West has given Ukraine these weapons, but it's taken so long that you can't pay a price for it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1475.0s)]
*  And there's been a big debate about the self deterrence. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1486.0s)]
*  This question about whether Putin, by dangling this threat in front of us, has gotten a huge benefit from it. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1488.0s)]
*  The Russians are claiming now that they have to dangle this threat because they're getting so many direct threats from the West, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1495.0s)]
*  including an interview from President Emmanuel Macron of France, which is published in The Economist, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1502.0s)]
*  in which he repeated something he said before, that he's refusing to rule out sending ground troops to Ukraine, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1507.0s)]
*  something, of course, that NATO has not done up until now. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1512.0s)]
*  There's also a statement by the UK Foreign Minister and former PM David Cameron that said for the first time that Ukraine was free to use British weapons to strike inside of Russia. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1516.0s)]
*  So basically what Putin is saying, if you stop self deterring, I got really scary things to say to you. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1526.0s)]
*  So I think that's really what's going on here. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1533.0s)]
*  The thing that I think is really interesting is I think people are really running out of patience with Putin and these threats [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1535.0s)]
*  because after the Russian defense ministry announced the nuclear drills, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1542.0s)]
*  the Lithuanian prime minister told the FT that her country is prepared to send soldiers on a training mission to Ukraine. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1545.0s)]
*  Now, whether this is the start of a major shift in NATO policy isn't clear. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1553.0s)]
*  But if you pile the Macron and the Cameron and the Lithuanians have always been infinitely more than all the vaults, more forward leaning. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1558.0s)]
*  But the French and the Brits, I think patience is running out here. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1568.0s)]
*  And whatever is going on, certainly Putin is worried that patience is running out. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1572.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the comment by the Brits in particular got the Russians' attention. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1578.0s)]
*  Macron has been talking a big game at various junctures of this war. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1582.0s)]
*  But if you look at what France has committed, it's much lower than a lot of other countries. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1586.0s)]
*  But the UK has stepped up with a lot of assistance and has a lot of firepower to contribute to this if it sees fit. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1591.0s)]
*  And France at the end of the day was the only G7 country to send a representative to Putin's inauguration for his new presidential term. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1598.0s)]
*  So they're trying to keep ties in with Russia to a certain extent. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1606.0s)]
*  But I think you're right. I think there could be a bit of Putin fatigue on this front. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1610.0s)]
*  Not to say that people take nuclear threats lightly, but that there is a bit of weariness and even weariness about what he really would be prepared to do. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1615.0s)]
*  It was a Russian move to announce tactical maneuvers or some sort, or I can't remember the exact language. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1623.0s)]
*  But it was definitely a type of language on the escalatory scale that was up from previous levels. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1629.0s)]
*  But at the same time, not really a sign that they're prepared to use nuclear tactical nukes in Ukraine. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1634.0s)]
*  But we also don't know at the end of the day what Putin is calculating as he's trying to move this conflict forward. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1640.0s)]
*  And even though he's said to be, you know, Russian side is certainly said to be on the gain, grinding it out on the eastern front of Ukraine. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1647.0s)]
*  They're also taking tremendous casualties and still taking a hit and still really worried about what NATO might have in store. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1655.0s)]
*  And that's our look at the turbulent world next week. Here are some other stories to keep an eye on. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV72kTbdb9c&t=1662.0s)]
