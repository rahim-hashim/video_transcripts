# Israel-Hamas Ground Campaign, Biden Hosts Latin American Leaders, Congress Debates Aid, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ)
*  In the coming week, U.S. Secretary of State Blinken returns to the Middle East, President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden hosts Latin American leaders, and Congress juggles aid packages and an impending shutdown. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=6.24s)]
*  It's November 2nd, 2023, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=12.4s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=27.2s)]
*  And I'm Karla Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=28.2s)]
*  Karla, welcome to November. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=29.36s)]
*  And let's start with what's on the horizon in the Israel-Hamas war. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=31.04s)]
*  Tomorrow, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is to visit Israel with plans to make [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=34.96s)]
*  additional stops in the region. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=39.12s)]
*  There have been daily reports not only of the fighting in Gaza, but a worsening situation [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=41.08s)]
*  for civilians there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=45.4s)]
*  What should we be looking for on this trip by Secretary Blinken? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=47.26s)]
*  The U.S. has more influence with the Israelis than any other country, but it is frankly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=51.56s)]
*  limited, and privately and increasingly publicly the Biden team are pressing the Israelis to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=55.6s)]
*  exercise more restraint, and particularly to limit civilian casualties as they go after [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=61.0s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=66.6s)]
*  And I'm not sure how much they are getting through, but I think that is a big part of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=67.6s)]
*  the mission of this trip. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Wednesday evening, President Biden said something that his advisors had been saying, but we [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=73.04s)]
*  hadn't been hearing from the president. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=77.16s)]
*  He said he thought there should be a humanitarian pause in the war to facilitate the release [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=78.68s)]
*  of hostages, and others are saying the need for a pause, others in the administration, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=83.6s)]
*  the need for a pause to get more aid in, to get more ill people out. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=87.72s)]
*  And the Israelis have until now consistently rejected the idea. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=92.88s)]
*  One of the things that Blinken is expected to do is he's going to press the Israelis [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=97.32s)]
*  to accept a series of humanitarian pauses, potentially to be able to get hostages out, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  and certainly to be able to get more aid in. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  In announcing Blinken's trip, the State Department spokesman said the secretary was going to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=113.2s)]
*  discuss American expectations that Israel be, quote, in full compliance with international [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=117.28s)]
*  humanitarian law and the laws of war. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  And he added, we will be direct about that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=124.8s)]
*  And that's a really different tone than we've been hearing from them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=127.64s)]
*  And I think that we can expect Blinken to press them pretty hard on what's going on [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=132.52s)]
*  in the West Bank, something we haven't been talking about. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=136.72s)]
*  There is a high and increasing level of violence. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  And I'm very sad to say this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=143.32s)]
*  A good deal of it driven by settlers backed by Israeli forces against Palestinians there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=144.56s)]
*  And there are a growing number of people inside the administration who are afraid that that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=149.76s)]
*  place is going to blow as well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  So that's a good part of that mission. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=154.92s)]
*  We can talk about what he's possibly going to be doing beyond Israel, but I think that's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=157.0s)]
*  a good part of what's going on there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=161.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  And as you were speaking, I'm thinking about all the other sort of side developments playing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  out. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=169.12s)]
*  So I think in the past week, we've seen some people allowed out of Gaza through the Rafah [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=170.12s)]
*  crossing, which is into Sinai, the Egyptian territory there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=175.52s)]
*  But do we think that's going to open up further? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=179.8s)]
*  Do we think there's going to be any move on the hostage front? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=181.84s)]
*  You don't hear a lot about the hostages. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  One was rescued, I guess, recently, but that's about it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, I thought it was quite interesting that the president, when he talked about this pause, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=188.24s)]
*  it was about getting prisoners out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  Does he know something? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  Maybe there's some sort of exchange there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  I think that there is some measurable progress there about Rafah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  There is a trickle of aid coming in that's pretty important, but nowhere near what they [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=203.6s)]
*  need. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=207.64s)]
*  And there is this deal that the US health broker in talks with Israel, Egypt, Hamas, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=209.48s)]
*  and Qatar to open the border to a limited number of people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=214.11999999999998s)]
*  On Wednesday, a few hundred people, some seriously injured Palestinians, foreign passport holders [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=218.04s)]
*  crossed from Gaza into Egypt. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=222.44s)]
*  And today, Thursday, Americans are coming out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  There's some expectation that as many as 1,000 foreign passport holders, as well as [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=228.44s)]
*  Palestinian staff members of international organizations, are expected to be able to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=233.44s)]
*  leave each day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=237.12s)]
*  Now, no one's saying those people are going to leave permanently. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=238.12s)]
*  The people who work for international organizations, but they'll be able to swap out so that they [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=240.28s)]
*  can basically have aid agencies be able to function there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=244.28s)]
*  If that happens, it's not going to relieve what is a humanitarian disaster inside of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=247.32s)]
*  Gaza, but it's some progress. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=251.4s)]
*  I assume that, you know, that Blinken is going to push for more progress on the humanitarian [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=255.68s)]
*  front, but I think a big part of this focus here is what's happening in the war, and I [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=260.76s)]
*  don't know how much progress he's going to make on that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=265.12s)]
*  And again, what seems to be happening is an Israeli military effort to really press into [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=267.64s)]
*  the north, to seal off the north, and going into Gaza City in particular, it has continually [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=272.68s)]
*  said civilians should flee south. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=278.12s)]
*  There's still hundreds of thousands, I believe, in the north, though, and that's only going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=280.08s)]
*  to make this more difficult. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=283.84s)]
*  The reports coming out are pretty wrenching. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  It's one of these situations that is defining this conflict, which is the Israeli insistence [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=287.64s)]
*  that this is self-defense and then this is, you know, an existential fight for them, and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=292.96s)]
*  it's the Palestinians caught, innocent Palestinians caught up in this, who the Israelis say are [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  being used as human shields by Hamas. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, you totally get what the Israelis are saying. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=305.0s)]
*  I mean, they went through this awful trauma, and Hamas is utterly unrepentant. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=308.0s)]
*  They're jubilant. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=313.6s)]
*  They're saying they would do it again if they could do it again. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=314.6s)]
*  And when people say if we don't defeat Hamas, wipe Hamas out, they will do it again. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=317.12s)]
*  So you can understand why strategically as well as tactically they want to do it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  But we're talking about urban warfare with still lots of civilians there, and this is [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=326.46000000000004s)]
*  an incredibly hard thing to do, and it's going to be incredibly hard for the Israelis as [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=331.04s)]
*  well. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=334.48s)]
*  We don't know what the ground troops are doing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=335.48s)]
*  There's been an incredible blackout about it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=337.68s)]
*  They tell us we're in the next phase. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=340.04s)]
*  They're very close to Gaza City. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  They're almost in Gaza City. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=343.68s)]
*  We hear about that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=345.0s)]
*  But what we do see is the impact of these, literally the impact of these massive airstrikes [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=346.0s)]
*  that have taken place in Gevalia in this neighborhood of Gaza that's referred to as a refugee camp. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  In reality, it's a neighborhood. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=354.88s)]
*  Israel said it targeted and killed Hamas militants, including a commander who had said it helped [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  plan the October 7th massacres. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  But what we saw were these images of the results of an airstrike in this densely populated [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  neighborhood just absolutely flattening an enormous crater. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=367.64s)]
*  It is believed, and I think utterly true, that Hamas militants are hiding out in these [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=371.44s)]
*  miles and miles of tunnels. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=375.36s)]
*  And so if you want to collapse the tunnels, that's what you're doing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=377.12s)]
*  But what's on top of the tunnels are apartment buildings with civilians. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=379.44s)]
*  And this is drawing widespread international criticism. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=384.6s)]
*  The UN Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights wrote on the platform previously [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=387.84s)]
*  known as Twitter, quote, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=393.0s)]
*  could amount to war crimes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=397.76s)]
*  The Israelis don't take the UN very seriously. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=400.16s)]
*  You can understand with their past experiences with the UN General Assembly why they might. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=401.88s)]
*  But you're hearing it from the Australians. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=406.8s)]
*  You're hearing it from lots of other countries. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=408.84s)]
*  And I think that Blinken is going to go there and he's going to warn the Israelis that while [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=410.96s)]
*  international sympathy was enormous in the wake of October 7th, it is not limitless. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=415.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=419.64s)]
*  And I think it's worth mentioning, as you were citing the different sides that are weighing [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=420.64s)]
*  in that we rely on the mainstream vetted media and the credible vetted media, as well as [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  any sort of press traveling with Blinken on this trip, for example, to be our sources on [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=432.04s)]
*  this, that we're not going with some of the wild claims that are flying around social [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=436.92s)]
*  media, but we're going with reputable reporting images and so forth. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=441.96s)]
*  And that's the way that media should be approaching this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=446.56s)]
*  But it's an extremely difficult environment to be relating information at this point. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=449.72s)]
*  And it's very hard to report in a war. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=454.35999999999996s)]
*  It's very hard to comment about wars. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  And you're in a particular situation right now in which the Israelis, of course, a democracy, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  but they have a huge news blackout about what they themselves are doing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=465.32s)]
*  But on the other side, and I really do criticize any media outlet that just does not caveat [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=469.12s)]
*  that any number they have for casualties, and they just say, well, the Gaza Health Ministry [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=475.52s)]
*  said that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=480.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, who controls the Gaza Health Ministry? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=481.29999999999995s)]
*  It's a Hamas controlled health ministry. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=482.8s)]
*  So we saw this with the hospital, of course, and there may well be who knows what the figures [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=485.16s)]
*  are of what's going on. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=491.12s)]
*  But we have seen these photographs because that's the other thing that has happened with [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  the internet is that we have seen real photographs. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=497.32s)]
*  We've also seen doctor's photographs. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=499.68s)]
*  So we all have to do this. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=502.5s)]
*  But there is definitely real photographs out there taken by legitimate news photographers. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=503.72s)]
*  And the level of destruction is enormous. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=508.64s)]
*  And the Israelis are in the midst of getting an enormous amount of pressure. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=511.0s)]
*  I don't know how much they're going to listen to that pressure. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=514.96s)]
*  They are determined to destroy Hamas. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=517.24s)]
*  And when they say things like, if we don't, they'll come after us again, you can understand [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=519.4s)]
*  why they feel that way. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=524.32s)]
*  On the other hand, urban warfare is a horrible thing when you're surrounded by civilians [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=525.36s)]
*  and they are surrounded by civilians. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=531.4s)]
*  And we should note just one other element which continues to draw concern is the other [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=534.28s)]
*  actors outside of the region getting involved. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=539.1s)]
*  There were reports this week of a Houthi attack that was intercepted by U.S. forces. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=542.62s)]
*  For example, the Houthis are Iran-aligned forces based in Yemen. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=546.54s)]
*  So we continue to watch the other interested and sometimes involved parties in this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=550.46s)]
*  Blinken is going to be sounding some positive notes on this trip. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=556.38s)]
*  Recall, President Biden wanted to go to Jordan. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=559.8199999999999s)]
*  That was canceled when he was there because of the hospital explosion. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=562.42s)]
*  I think Blinken is going to go on this trip. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=568.02s)]
*  He's also going to start talking a lot about the need for a post-conflict two-state solution, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=570.02s)]
*  something that has never been top of mind for the Biden administration. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=575.74s)]
*  And not surprisingly, lots of administrations have tried and gotten nowhere. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=580.26s)]
*  I think they're going to want to push forward and give a vision for regional allies and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=583.82s)]
*  give a vision for the Palestinian people that there's something after the Gaza war. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=589.34s)]
*  I don't know how much progress they're going to make with those images on the television. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=594.34s)]
*  But that's going to be, I believe, the second part of this trip and a big commitment. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=597.98s)]
*  And they're pushed forward with that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=602.3800000000001s)]
*  So I think we're going to be talking about that as well, Bob. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=604.3000000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=607.0600000000001s)]
*  And we'll see how many other venues Blinken goes to. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=608.0600000000001s)]
*  So Bob, back to Washington. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=611.0200000000001s)]
*  Tomorrow, Friday, President Biden will host the America's Partnership for Economic Prosperity. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  Is there an acronym that goes with that? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=618.3000000000001s)]
*  Yes, there is. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=620.7800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=621.7800000000001s)]
*  Leaders' Summit. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=622.7800000000001s)]
*  It's a Leaders' Summit. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=623.7800000000001s)]
*  He's invited leaders from South American nations to discuss regional economic growth [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=624.78s)]
*  and migration, which of course is not just a challenge for the U.S. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=628.5799999999999s)]
*  These are really big issues to cover in one day's summit. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=632.42s)]
*  So anything really going to get done there? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=634.9s)]
*  Well let me first lay out the acronyms, Carla. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=638.54s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=640.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  So this is APEP, A-P-E-P, okay. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=642.8199999999999s)]
*  Not to be confused with APEC, which is a summit that's coming up in San Francisco in just [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=645.9s)]
*  about two weeks or less than two weeks. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=650.26s)]
*  Is there going to be an APEP rally? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=651.74s)]
*  Well, we'll see if it's successful. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=653.8199999999999s)]
*  We could, and we can come back and really have a lot of fun with that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=655.4599999999999s)]
*  But first things first, there's another acronym that we should also understand, which is IPEF, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  which is sort of the sister acronym to APEP, which is a – these are sort of twin regional [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=662.62s)]
*  initiatives involving increasing economic ties that are short of any sort of free trade [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=667.0999999999999s)]
*  agenda because that's kind of taboo these days in American politics. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=671.66s)]
*  However, there are compelling needs to expand economic ties. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=675.6999999999999s)]
*  IPEF is the Indo-Pacific version of APEP, although it's been much more involved and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=679.74s)]
*  had much more legs than APEP has. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=685.0600000000001s)]
*  APEP has 11 countries, and if you go alphabetically, it's Dominican Republic to Uruguay, which [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=687.7s)]
*  are somewhat smallish. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=694.02s)]
*  But then if you get into the middle of it, you get into Chile and Mexico and Peru and [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=695.22s)]
*  so forth. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=700.02s)]
*  And as you say, there's the two primary issues, the regional growth and migration, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=701.02s)]
*  and that's a narrowed focus. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=704.98s)]
*  It was originally launched back in 2022, and it was supposed to focus on areas like digital [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=706.72s)]
*  trade and decarbonization, anti-corruption, and so forth. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=711.96s)]
*  And now it's been more narrowed to developing regional supply chains. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=716.0400000000001s)]
*  We've heard that quite a bit recently. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=719.6s)]
*  Managing migration and producing clean energy. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=721.84s)]
*  A lot of experts say these seem to be attainable areas for some sort of progress. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=724.1600000000001s)]
*  Certainly, I think there's a desire to get the US into the mix with these countries at [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=729.44s)]
*  a time when China's Belt and Road has made pretty big inroads into the region, including [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=734.88s)]
*  some of these countries. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=739.04s)]
*  Although when you talk about migration, for example, while it's important, Mexico is there. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  The so-called Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras are [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=743.84s)]
*  not in part because they don't meet the criteria of the robust democracies that Biden would [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=747.36s)]
*  like to be talking to, the Biden administration would like to be talking to. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=752.82s)]
*  So again, it's a one-day event. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=755.36s)]
*  It's in a moment in a season of discussing trade and trade-related issues and integration [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=757.86s)]
*  with like-minded partners. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=763.34s)]
*  And so the administration is hoping in the midst of all these other things going on in [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=766.1s)]
*  the world, they're able to kind of make some common ground. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=769.58s)]
*  And again, this migration issue, it's really about having a common playbook for how to [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=772.38s)]
*  deal with the huge numbers of people moving around the region. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=777.0s)]
*  One final thing I'll say about that, Carla, is that the administration is taking steps [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=780.26s)]
*  with a number of countries, especially Venezuela, to try to deal with the flows. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=784.2s)]
*  Venezuela has been a large source country of migrants. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=789.5s)]
*  The administration has been working with the Venezuelan government on reform on its end [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=792.5s)]
*  and in exchange, easing up sanctions on Venezuelan oil. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=797.78s)]
*  And there's an agreement for the administration to accept temporarily almost half a million [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=801.7s)]
*  Venezuelans into the U.S. while still deporting others as they process their cases. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=806.46s)]
*  So there's a lot of things circulating here. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=811.16s)]
*  Again, there's hope that a narrowing of the agenda will allow them to claim at least some progress. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=813.46s)]
*  So can we talk a little bit more about Venezuela? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=819.9200000000001s)]
*  Because it used to be when you had these regional meetings, it was all about what a disaster [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=822.6800000000001s)]
*  Venezuela was under Chavez and then under Maduro. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=828.44s)]
*  And then when the Ukraine War came around, it looked like they were willing to say, well, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  Maduro is not so bad because they've got oil, so we're going to look the other way. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=837.0s)]
*  Do we really believe there's progress in Venezuela so this easing of sanctions is less about [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=841.32s)]
*  oil prices or less about feeling pressure on migration? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=847.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, is there really progress there? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=851.9799999999999s)]
*  Ultimately, we'll see when these elections turn around. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=853.74s)]
*  They're supposed to be happening in 2024. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=856.14s)]
*  The administration has gotten guarantees, electoral guarantees that Venezuelan government [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=858.38s)]
*  and the political opposition will work together on holding such elections. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=862.8199999999999s)]
*  The track record is not great, if not bad on this front. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=867.3s)]
*  But as you say, there's the compelling leverage of getting Venezuelan oil online. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=871.56s)]
*  Venezuela possesses, I believe still to this day, the largest oil reserves in the world. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=876.94s)]
*  And it's had a battered, beaten up oil sector that was abused under Chavez and manipulated [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  face sanctions. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=888.44s)]
*  And so that's certainly going to get attention. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=889.44s)]
*  Can we get some sort of grand bargain that involves political and also and somehow eases [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=892.2600000000001s)]
*  the stress on migration and the height of the Venezuelan crisis? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=897.2s)]
*  Something like 7 million Venezuelans had fled the country in different directions. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=900.5200000000001s)]
*  Again, they've been a large contingent of people coming to the US. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=904.54s)]
*  And some of this is the natural kind of progression of migrants who come because they have family [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=908.0600000000001s)]
*  members or acquaintances who are already in the US and see that as an attractive option. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=912.46s)]
*  But I don't know if this summit is going to have any migrant deliverables beyond some [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=917.62s)]
*  further discussion, especially with the Mexican leadership. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=923.14s)]
*  I mean, that's going to be a big one. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=925.14s)]
*  I'm looking for some progress because the Mexicans themselves hosted a Latin American [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=926.42s)]
*  summit not too long ago talking through some of these issues. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=929.94s)]
*  Carlo, I'm going to stay in DC because quite a bit is happening on Capitol Hill. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=933.72s)]
*  Just this very day as we're taping this podcast, the House was due to vote on standalone funding [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=938.88s)]
*  bill for Israel. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=943.0s)]
*  And this is because newly elected speaker Mike Johnson has pushed to separate such a [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=944.9200000000001s)]
*  bill from military assistance for Ukraine, which a number of lawmakers from both parties, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=948.6s)]
*  as well as President Biden, would like. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=953.2s)]
*  There's other aspects about this bill, including a poison pill aspect that we can talk about. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=955.44s)]
*  But there's also other appropriations bills to be considered. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=959.36s)]
*  So are we looking at a Congress that's going to sort of continue to play out the really [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=962.22s)]
*  kind of bitter divides? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=965.82s)]
*  Or is there going to be any sort of meeting of the mind after maybe some theater is over? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=967.0s)]
*  Oh, boy, I wish I could tell you that things were going to get better. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=970.88s)]
*  I do too. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=974.36s)]
*  There's finally a speaker in the House, which in theory means Congress can get some work [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=975.36s)]
*  done. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=979.84s)]
*  And Louisiana Congressman Mike Johnson, who I had never heard of him, as they say, a relative [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=981.32s)]
*  newcomer got the job after all the big names had knocked each other out of the race. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=987.28s)]
*  And so he came in because his caucus was so exhausted. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=992.74s)]
*  And I, and you would think that I'd spent so many years in Washington that I would not [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=995.9s)]
*  have a optimistic or idealistic bone left in my body, but I do. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=999.4599999999999s)]
*  I thought there was a chance because everyone was so exhausted for him to exercise some [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1003.6999999999999s)]
*  real leadership here and pass ambitious legislation, even bills, dare I say, that might require [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1007.64s)]
*  some votes from the other side of the aisle. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1013.06s)]
*  But it appears not to be. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1015.98s)]
*  He seems more concerned than anything else about keeping his divided caucus together [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1018.12s)]
*  and not suffering the same fate as Kevin McCarthy. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1021.76s)]
*  Although on the theory of exhausted, I think that he had some running room here and instead [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1025.6399999999999s)]
*  he decided not to use any of it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1030.68s)]
*  So what did he do immediately? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1032.52s)]
*  He's got two issues that are right there. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1034.32s)]
*  One of course was this, you know, big gulp, $106 billion supplemental for Ukraine, Israel, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1037.04s)]
*  Taiwan, order money that President Biden asked for and that Mitch McConnell very much [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1044.44s)]
*  wanted to play with. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1048.66s)]
*  And then of course, the other question is the money that runs out in a couple of weeks [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1050.3400000000001s)]
*  for funding the government to keep it open. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1053.8600000000001s)]
*  So the Ukraine money was something that he could have run with. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1057.14s)]
*  Now we do know he voted against Ukraine money himself, but he had room to show real leadership. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1060.26s)]
*  And instead, what did he do? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1065.3400000000001s)]
*  As you said, he carved the money out for Israel and he put a poison pill in it as well. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1067.18s)]
*  He proposed a $14.3 billion standalone funding bill and then said he was going to take the [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1071.4s)]
*  same amount of money from the IRS budget, money that had been put in as part of the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1076.7600000000002s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act that is intended to help the IRS go after wealthy tax cheats. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1081.48s)]
*  And the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1088.0s)]
*  estimated the bill would actually decrease revenues by $26.8 billion over the 2024-2033 [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1092.72s)]
*  period. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1099.64s)]
*  So while it was a feel-good thing for people who hate the IRS, who was actually going to [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1101.5800000000002s)]
*  mean less revenue, not more, you could grandstand and say, we're saving money. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1106.14s)]
*  But in reality, you're actually losing money by doing this. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1111.22s)]
*  And tying security aid to Israel to this is just, it's just political grandstanding. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1114.5800000000002s)]
*  And I don't think, you know, it's probably going to pass the House. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1121.18s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1124.22s)]
*  But by the time this goes out, we'll know what happened. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1125.22s)]
*  The majority leader Chuck Schumer called it a joke and stunningly unserious. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1128.62s)]
*  Mitch McConnell's not happy with it either. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1133.2399999999998s)]
*  Johnson went over to private lunch with the GOP senators across the Capitol, a very traditional [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1135.4799999999998s)]
*  thing for a new speaker to do. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1141.04s)]
*  And he didn't get a lot of rave reviews. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1143.8s)]
*  Certainly, you know, Josh Hawley liked him. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1145.28s)]
*  And there were people who were opposed to the Ukraine aid who liked him. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1147.36s)]
*  But McConnell sat there in stony silence from all the reports out of this meeting. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1150.36s)]
*  So McConnell's theory of the game is that if you don't put the Ukraine money together [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1154.96s)]
*  with the Israel money and you don't do it all in one big gulp, given the electoral season [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1160.48s)]
*  that's coming up, given the fact that Donald Trump is going to campaign against this spending, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  you're never going to get it. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1169.3s)]
*  And McConnell is such a believer in it that what was he doing while this was all being [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1170.3400000000001s)]
*  put together? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1173.58s)]
*  He was hosting the Ukrainian ambassador. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1174.58s)]
*  So we see a big fight that's developing. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1177.66s)]
*  We'll see whether McConnell holds his line or Johnson holds his line. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1179.8600000000001s)]
*  And as if to put an exclamation point on the Ukraine side of it, we heard news this morning [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1183.9799999999998s)]
*  that Ukraine faced its biggest barrage of Russian air attacks in the year. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1187.6599999999999s)]
*  And Ukrainian officials have been active in giving interviews to a number of Western media, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1192.62s)]
*  major Western media talking about the gloomy state of affairs on the Eastern Front, stalemate [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1197.52s)]
*  at best, and heading into a difficult winter, which is always very difficult. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1202.7199999999998s)]
*  And as we get close to two years of this war, we've also seen figures coming out of Russia [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1207.32s)]
*  or projections out of Russia for their longer term budgeting, where they are seemingly in [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1211.98s)]
*  for the long run in terms of how they want to prosecute this war. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1216.5s)]
*  So it's all the more reason to step up and show Ukraine has support from its most important [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1219.6000000000001s)]
*  ally, a signal to other US allies as well, and to Russia, which has been calculating [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1226.22s)]
*  that it can play the time game better than the West. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1231.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, and Lloyd Austin, the Secretary of Defense, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1234.78s)]
*  were testifying in the Senate this week, and they tried to tie this all together, Israel, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1239.92s)]
*  the Russians, Iran, and Hamas. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1245.72s)]
*  And I don't think they were overreaching, to be perfectly frank. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1248.76s)]
*  I think we live in a very dangerous world right now, and we certainly know Iran is backing [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1251.68s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1256.96s)]
*  We certainly know the Russians in Syria playing around, and Iran. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1257.96s)]
*  I think there are a lot of bad actors out there who are messing around in the world. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1262.1200000000001s)]
*  If this funding gets caught up in political grandstanding, I think it's really bad for [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1266.34s)]
*  American national security. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1271.54s)]
*  I think that Mitch McConnell gets it, but whether he's going to push back and whether [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1273.5s)]
*  Johnson... [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1278.78s)]
*  I mean, there are members of Johnson's caucus, a few of them, who don't even want to vote [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1279.78s)]
*  for the Israel money. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1283.1399999999999s)]
*  There is an isolationist wing of the Republican Party that is increasingly ascendant. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1284.6599999999999s)]
*  Johnson did tell the senators that he will bring up a Ukraine bill after this, and I [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1289.68s)]
*  know if he's trying to mollify McConnell or what, but McConnell's feeling, and I think [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1296.6399999999999s)]
*  the feeling of the Democrats in the White House and pretty much anybody else who handicaps [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1301.72s)]
*  this is if you don't do it now, it's not going to happen. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1305.1599999999999s)]
*  So we'll see how it plays out. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1308.1599999999999s)]
*  The other thing that we have to watch the space is that the government funding is going [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1309.84s)]
*  to... [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1313.44s)]
*  Government's going to shut down in two weeks if they don't move quickly on this. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1314.44s)]
*  He told the senators he wants to fund the government through January 15th. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1317.08s)]
*  He'd originally floated an idea through April 15th as another funding deadline, but I think [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1320.24s)]
*  he was warned that if you don't... [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1324.6399999999999s)]
*  Nothing focuses the brain like a clearer deadline, a sooner deadline. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1327.4199999999998s)]
*  Nothing focuses the brain like having a deadline to deal with. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1330.84s)]
*  And so he's now saying January 15th, McConnell wants to pass the prorations bills. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1333.6399999999999s)]
*  So we'll see how the two of them work that one out. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1338.2s)]
*  But I think the big test right now is it's a big funding bill, and we're going to see [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1340.08s)]
*  how that fight plays out. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1343.28s)]
*  Interestingly enough, it's as much a Republican on Republican fight as it is a Republican [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1344.62s)]
*  on Democrat fight. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1348.86s)]
*  And a few signs within the Democratic side as well of discontent, although not enough, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1350.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't think, to block any sort of funding measure at this stage. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1355.58s)]
*  But yeah, we're at a very fraught political moment. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1358.74s)]
*  And I can't imagine for the Ukrainians who we were all following on such a daily basis [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1362.26s)]
*  what was going on, and then this news about this barrage, and it barely makes it into [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1367.8999999999999s)]
*  anybody's consciousness because we are rightly paying attention to the horrors of what's [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1371.72s)]
*  going on in the Middle East. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1376.5s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that there aren't two wars going on, the two wars that are of fundamental [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1377.54s)]
*  national security interests to the United States as well as fundamental human and moral [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1382.9s)]
*  concern. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1386.3s)]
*  And to get that caught up into this sort of American political grandstanding is a grave [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1388.18s)]
*  concern here. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1393.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1395.02s)]
*  This is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1401.42s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1406.3200000000002s)]
*  And this week, Bob, our audience selected 6.9 million displaced in the Democratic Republic [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1408.0s)]
*  of the Congo. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1414.0800000000002s)]
*  So we were just talking about displacement in Sudan. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1415.0800000000002s)]
*  What's happening now in the DRC? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1418.5600000000002s)]
*  Yes, these major conflicts are playing out with fewer people watching, but they're no [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1421.04s)]
*  less important. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1426.3200000000002s)]
*  And that number really stood out, I think, to a lot of people. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1427.44s)]
*  Eastern Congo, where a lot of this displacement is happening, is no stranger to difficulty [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1431.3799999999999s)]
*  in war and privation and war crimes, frankly. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1436.34s)]
*  And there's more of that playing out now. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1440.78s)]
*  A lot of it centers around fighting involving a group known as M23. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1442.46s)]
*  And this has seized a pretty large chunk of territory in the East. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1447.86s)]
*  It's fighting government-aligned militias. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1450.6599999999999s)]
*  And M23 is led by ethnic Tutsis. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1453.54s)]
*  There have been reports that it's supported heavily by Rwanda. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1456.62s)]
*  Rwanda leadership denies a claim that is backing the group, but it clearly is able to sustain [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1459.92s)]
*  itself and has been for a long time. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  And so with that, you have the abuses happening to individuals. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1468.96s)]
*  We should also note that this is an area where the UN has had a large peacekeeping contingent [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  for almost 20 years. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1477.2800000000002s)]
*  At last report, Carla, there are more than 16,000 peacekeepers in the DRC, and there's [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1478.64s)]
*  a budget of roughly a billion dollars. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1483.24s)]
*  So it's one of the largest, if not the largest, peacekeeping operation that the UN runs. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1485.04s)]
*  But the writ of their mandate is sometimes limited in what they're able to get involved [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1490.3799999999999s)]
*  in in terms of keeping the peace. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1494.04s)]
*  They have also faced claims of abuses as well. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1495.8999999999999s)]
*  Still it's facing huge and daunting problems in its ability to be effective. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1499.46s)]
*  And these peacekeepers themselves come in harm's way and have had a number of casualties [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1504.06s)]
*  in recent years. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1507.42s)]
*  Again, it's a region that, if people have not focused on it before, is a vast resource-rich [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1508.42s)]
*  region, very remote from the capital of Kinshasa. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1514.22s)]
*  But there are terrible cases of abuse playing out there. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1517.46s)]
*  The blog that CFR runs from its Women in Foreign Policy program noted a huge rise in sexual [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1520.8600000000001s)]
*  assault cases against displaced women that Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1525.46s)]
*  Borders, has been providing a lot of information about female victims of sexual violence that [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1530.54s)]
*  it treats. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1534.94s)]
*  It's one of the few groups that's active in the region, the Médecins Sans Frontières. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1535.94s)]
*  The UN and the International Organization of Migration is running scores of camps to [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1539.4199999999998s)]
*  deal with displaced people. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1543.6799999999998s)]
*  And they're going to need to run hundreds more to properly help these populations. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1545.4199999999998s)]
*  But there are very few people who have the ability to step in and stop the abuses from [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1549.8999999999999s)]
*  happening in terms of an armed presence. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1553.9599999999998s)]
*  And it just continues to get worse. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1557.02s)]
*  And oh, by the way, the DRC is still planning to hold elections in December. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1558.4599999999998s)]
*  That will kick off an election season. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1562.04s)]
*  So we're not sure whether or how much of the eastern part of the country is going to be [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1564.02s)]
*  involved in any fashion in that. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1568.02s)]
*  So the UN, unlike in Sudan, is in the DRC. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1570.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1575.18s)]
*  But is it a force that can actually make a difference in this situation? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1576.18s)]
*  It has been a large force of a number of thousands of peacekeepers, but a large force in an extremely [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1579.54s)]
*  large area. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1586.1s)]
*  And again, it relies on, as any peacekeeping force, it relies on what its mandate is from [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1587.7s)]
*  the UN Security Council, its ability to engage and to not only defend itself, but to defend [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1592.18s)]
*  defenseless people. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1597.9s)]
*  And so I think its ability to be assertive is somewhat limited at the moment. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1599.14s)]
*  We'll see if this plays out in the Security Council. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1603.5s)]
*  Again, as we've discussed before, Security Council has not been a forum in recent years [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1605.26s)]
*  for effective action to preserve peace, but more like an arena for competition between [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1609.3s)]
*  some of the major powers in the Security Council. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1616.06s)]
*  And as I said, when you talk about Congo and you talk about its interests, you can't get [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1618.78s)]
*  away from its resources, especially resources that are needed in new emerging economies [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1622.42s)]
*  like rare earths and things like that. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1627.3799999999999s)]
*  So there's a mining element that is also involved here as well as other things. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1629.3s)]
*  I would note for those wanting to get up to speed really quickly, we have a conflict tracker [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1635.26s)]
*  from our Center for Preventive Action on the Democratic Republic of Congo that is very [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1638.8999999999999s)]
*  comprehensive and will bring you up to speed pretty quickly. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1642.86s)]
*  But again, back to the UN and its abilities, I think it would require a lead country or [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1645.74s)]
*  countries to kind of step in and say, you know, it's time to put an end to this and [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1650.4599999999998s)]
*  provide a safe haven for these people. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1654.5s)]
*  It has been a lot of trial and error over the years, but the UN is best situated to [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1656.5s)]
*  do something about it. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1661.66s)]
*  And that's our look at the world next week. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWmfstUVQ&t=1663.42s)]
