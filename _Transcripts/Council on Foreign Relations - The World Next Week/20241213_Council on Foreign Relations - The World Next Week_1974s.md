# Syrians Plot Transition, Turmoil in Georgia and Romania, UK Joins Trans-Pacific Trade Deal, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA)
*  In the coming week, Syria pursues a transition after the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=0.0s)]
*  Romania and Georgia confront different kinds of political turmoil, and the United Kingdom [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=5.12s)]
*  will join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=8.96s)]
*  God, you said that so clearly. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=13.36s)]
*  And I said that on December 12, 2024, where it's time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=15.44s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=30.0s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=32.48s)]
*  Carla, we have to begin in Syria. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=34.08s)]
*  The last time we spoke, there was mere advancing of rebels towards the south of the country [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=36.32s)]
*  in the area of Homs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=42.96s)]
*  Within a few days, obviously, Bashar al-Assad was on a plane to Moscow, and then rebels [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=43.96s)]
*  were in Damascus, if not in control of most of the country. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  But what happens now? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=52.36s)]
*  Does the U.S. or anyone else in the region have a post-Assad Syria strategy? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=53.36s)]
*  This is moving so quickly that everyone's really scrambling. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=58.4s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan are both in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=61.44s)]
*  the region, and they're saying all the right things about wanting an inclusive Syrian-led [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=65.96s)]
*  transition. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=70.88s)]
*  But their real goal for the Biden administration, which really doesn't have much time left [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=71.88s)]
*  to influence events, is trying to stop Syria from turning into another Libya. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=76.4s)]
*  And so far, President Trump has declared that this is not our fight and we should have nothing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=81.58s)]
*  to do with it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=85.3s)]
*  I'm not really sure they're going to have much chance by the time they come into office. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=86.3s)]
*  The U.S. has long had troops on the ground to fight ISIS in Syria, and since this weekend, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=91.46s)]
*  they've been monitoring chemical weapons sites and hitting ISIS targets. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=97.82s)]
*  And as far as I can tell, it doesn't appear to be a significant escalation of what it's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=101.38s)]
*  been doing before Assad fell. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  But there are reports that these Kurdish-run camps where ISIS prisoners are being held [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  may be coming under attack. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=113.14s)]
*  So I think the Pentagon may have to make some decisions pretty quickly about how much deeper [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=114.44s)]
*  they want to get involved. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=118.58s)]
*  But I think the bottom line here is that they really would like to limit the chaos as much [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=120.7s)]
*  as they possibly can. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=125.8s)]
*  I don't think they've got big geostrategic goals here for Syria, limited by time and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=126.88s)]
*  limited by the fact that it really is in our fight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=131.96s)]
*  The Israelis and Turks seem to have greater ambitions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=136.52s)]
*  Israel, really extraordinary what they're doing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=139.56s)]
*  They've conducted hundreds of airstrikes sinking Syria's navy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=142.4s)]
*  Did this navy really pose a threat to them? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Attacking chemical weapons sites, munitions factories, all sorts of other military assets. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=148.68s)]
*  And today, Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israeli troops are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=153.52s)]
*  going to stay inside Syrian territory. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=157.72s)]
*  It seized over the weekend the so-called buffer zone until what he described as, quote, a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=159.76s)]
*  new force has established that meets its security demands. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, what they're saying is that they want to keep this weaponry away from extremists. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=168.68s)]
*  They're predictably rejecting all criticisms, all warnings. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=173.84s)]
*  But really, what it seems to me what they want to do is they want to ensure that whatever [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=177.32s)]
*  government emerges will be, if not fully pacified, pretty close to it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=181.0s)]
*  So they're unable to threaten Israel militarily, unable to provide any support for Hezbollah, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=186.16s)]
*  what's left of it, and they'll just provide any support for Iran. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=190.84s)]
*  And given their history with Syria, you can understand it, but it's a dangerous game [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=194.98s)]
*  they're playing right there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  But they're pretty proof to any criticism given everything that's happened in Lebanon [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=200.89999999999998s)]
*  and Gaza. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  The Turks, another major player, seem determined to use this moment for their own self-interest [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=211.22s)]
*  They want to try to weaken or wipe out Syrian Kurdish forces. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=212.22s)]
*  I think what Erdogan is worried about is this possibility of another Kurdistan-like model [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=214.7s)]
*  inside of Syria and how they do that without getting drawn into a more direct fight with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=219.58s)]
*  the US, which is a NATO ally is less than clear to me. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=226.10000000000002s)]
*  The Pentagon has long supported Kurdish groups in Syria as proxies in this fight against [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=229.74s)]
*  the Islamic State. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=233.74s)]
*  And there was all sorts of reports that there were Kurdish Syrian forces backed by the US [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=234.82000000000002s)]
*  fighting Erdogan rebels over the weekend. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  There seems to potentially be a ceasefire around there, but Blinken is on his way to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=244.26000000000002s)]
*  Ankara to talk to Erdogan. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=248.62s)]
*  We'll see if this can hold. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=250.22s)]
*  But the potential there of a NATO ally against NATO ally fight is a pretty frightening thing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=252.34s)]
*  We've seen it before on the ground there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=257.38s)]
*  And finally, just to go through all the other players here, the Russians, of course, big [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=259.38s)]
*  players on the ground there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  We've seen very little action and they have this warm water port that they very much want. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=265.66s)]
*  They seem to have pulled some troops out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=271.5s)]
*  They are big losers in this, imperial overstretch. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=273.62s)]
*  At the same time, all sorts of reports they would love to negotiate to try to keep it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=277.22s)]
*  I would have to suspect if there is a government that emerges there, they're going to make [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=281.18s)]
*  a pretty big demand. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=285.38000000000005s)]
*  And I would suspect a big demand would be, you want to keep that port? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  Give us Assad. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=290.12s)]
*  And Iran, biggest loser of all in this, big geopolitical loser on this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=292.3s)]
*  And it seems oddly passive so far. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=296.74s)]
*  They've denounced Assad's fall as an American and Israeli plot, but they've also blamed [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=299.1s)]
*  Assad for his own weakness. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=303.8s)]
*  They've got some pretty hard thinking of their own about how they move forward. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=306.26s)]
*  Do they rush toward a nuclear weapon, God forbid? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=309.14s)]
*  Do they try to negotiate with the Americans and the Europeans after this? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=311.82s)]
*  This is really a big loss both for Russia and Iran, but more than anything else for Iran. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=315.22s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many elements there. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=319.22s)]
*  And as you were talking, I was doing a mental scorecard, which has been also part of our [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=321.18s)]
*  website coverage. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=325.54s)]
*  Winners, as you say, Turkey certainly, Israel at the time being, losers certainly, Iran, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=327.1s)]
*  Russia, and then other players who have a vested interest, Syrian Kurds, the Sunni jihadist [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=335.18s)]
*  forces. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=342.94s)]
*  And Syria is this incredible mix of different ethnic groups and religious sects within religious [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=343.94s)]
*  sects that it's going to be a while to unwind where their loyalties lie as well. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=348.7s)]
*  But so many different things from what you said. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=353.38s)]
*  I think in particular, the point of giving up Assad is interesting as we see the ongoing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=355.1s)]
*  kind of wrenching experience going on of opening up this matrix of prisons, the Sednaia [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=362.06s)]
*  prisons, which is just awful, really, really showing the depths of horror and depravity [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=367.22s)]
*  of this regime and what they were doing to their domestic opponents across the spectrum, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=373.62s)]
*  political opponents, people who had military objections, students, what have you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=379.06s)]
*  It is just awful. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=383.54s)]
*  You do not want to see that go past without impunity, but that has to involve people close [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=385.18s)]
*  to Assad. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=390.26s)]
*  How much of the current members of the government who have been trying to be part of the standing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=391.26s)]
*  up of a new Syria are implicated in any of that? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=395.94s)]
*  It's not clear. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=398.5s)]
*  This is part of the messiness of a transition. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=399.78s)]
*  And it's really going to be interesting to see if this rebel coalition that swept into [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  Damascus, how they're going to handle things. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=407.06s)]
*  They are seemingly saying the right things about everything from finding and controlling [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=410.94s)]
*  chemical weapons stocks to trying to be inclusive government and so on. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=415.53999999999996s)]
*  It's so early and as is often with this podcast, we sit down, we say a few things and then [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=419.61999999999995s)]
*  we're overtaken, Karla. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=424.41999999999996s)]
*  Sometimes we get it right in our prediction. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=425.41999999999996s)]
*  Sometimes we do. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=427.61999999999995s)]
*  Let's call the world next week. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=428.61999999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=429.61999999999995s)]
*  Maybe the world in the next few minutes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=430.61999999999995s)]
*  We know so little about this main rebel group that overthrew Assad, HDS. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  Are they Al-Qaeda? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=438.02s)]
*  Are they the Taliban? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  Can they win control of the country itself? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=440.78s)]
*  It's one thing to sweep into Damascus. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=443.05999999999995s)]
*  It's another thing to hold onto it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  The leader is still classified as a terrorist by the US, by the UK, by the UN. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=447.34s)]
*  As you said, he's distanced himself from Al-Qaeda, but all the reports from Idlib where [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=452.94s)]
*  they were in control, it wasn't a nice place. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=458.09999999999997s)]
*  They have said all the right things that they're going to treat minorities right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=462.26s)]
*  I haven't seen a lot of reporting about how they're going to treat women. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=465.58s)]
*  Big question. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=468.62s)]
*  The US is wrestling with this. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=469.94s)]
*  Should we be talking to them? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=471.85999999999996s)]
*  Can we moderate them? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=473.21999999999997s)]
*  Do we enable them? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=474.29999999999995s)]
*  We're out the door anyway. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=475.7s)]
*  We do know that there are Turkish and Gatari delegations already in Damascus for talks [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=477.9s)]
*  with them. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=482.58s)]
*  They seem to want to play the game. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=483.7s)]
*  The Turks in particular very much want to be kingmakers in this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=485.46s)]
*  It's going to take a long time for us to try to figure out what's going to emerge from [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=490.98s)]
*  this, but in the near term, trying to get control of those chemical weapons sites seems [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=494.86s)]
*  like a very important, important goal. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=499.82s)]
*  Certainly finding any Americans that are on the ground if they want to participate [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=504.5s)]
*  with the US on that seems like an absolutely, Austin Tice and others, absolutely an essential [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=508.22s)]
*  role. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=512.46s)]
*  It's really tough for the Biden administration. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=514.06s)]
*  They don't have much time here. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=515.46s)]
*  Avoiding a fight with the Turks seems like a pretty good idea. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=518.82s)]
*  Not abandoning the Kurds, that seems like we've relied very much on them. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=522.18s)]
*  They're going to have to make some potentially pretty big decisions if those prisons are [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=526.34s)]
*  under attack. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=530.22s)]
*  I definitely don't want to release thousands of ISIS or ISIS supporters on the ground. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=531.26s)]
*  Yeah, and your mention of the Kurds was significant in that some analysts have said Turkey took [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=535.5s)]
*  note of the way the US supported, nurtured, sheltered the Kurds in northern Iraq, and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=540.62s)]
*  they still have this pretty autonomous status to this day in that part of Iraq. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=545.5s)]
*  Turkey would not like to see that happen in Syria in regards to the Syrian Kurds as particularly [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=553.14s)]
*  dangerous and threatening to them in terms of ties to separatists, Kurds in their own [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=557.9399999999999s)]
*  country. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=562.18s)]
*  So that is one of the many plot lines that will be worth following. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=563.18s)]
*  Bob, let's move to Europe and charges of Russian meddling and two embattled democracies. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=566.5s)]
*  I'm not sure we can use the word democracy anymore with Georgia, but we're going to talk [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=572.34s)]
*  about Romania and Georgia. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=576.66s)]
*  In Romania, the Constitutional Court ordered annulled the first round of its presidential [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=578.8199999999999s)]
*  election and called off the final vote. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=583.5s)]
*  They're going to say they're going to have another election, but they're not saying when. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=586.86s)]
*  It seemed inevitable that this far-right candidate was going to win, and their justification [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=591.5s)]
*  for calling this off was they said that the campaign had been tainted by manipulation [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=596.38s)]
*  of digital media. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=600.58s)]
*  Huh? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=602.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the government itself, which isn't the court, has accused TikTok of violating [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=603.0600000000001s)]
*  Romanian regulations. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=607.72s)]
*  I've said that Russian-managed bots were involved in it, but they haven't offered an enormous [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=608.72s)]
*  amount of proof of this. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=612.58s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Georgia, protesters have been in the streets for two weeks after the ruling [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=614.9399999999999s)]
*  Dream Party, and we've talked about this a lot. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=619.02s)]
*  It's backed by this billionaire who made his fortune in Russia. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=621.86s)]
*  They suspended talks on their bid to join the EU, and this goal of joining the EU is [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=625.0s)]
*  actually written into the Georgian Constitution. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=630.14s)]
*  So I suppose I've got two questions for you. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=633.16s)]
*  How serious is the threat to democracy in Romania? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=636.22s)]
*  I get sort of nervous when people suspend elections, even if the people who are going [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=639.66s)]
*  to win are not people I like. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=644.14s)]
*  And is Russia really the main villain here? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=646.26s)]
*  I haven't seen a lot of evidence of that, although I don't doubt it, because we've [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=647.9s)]
*  seen an enormous amount of Russian meddling in lots of elections, and this particular [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=651.02s)]
*  sort of bot meddling. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=655.66s)]
*  Yes, I think first it's worth saying that the two cases you mentioned, we deliberately [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=657.18s)]
*  put them together in this podcast because there are striking similarities, but also [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  clear differences. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=665.86s)]
*  Romania is a member of NATO. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=667.3s)]
*  Romania is a member of the European Union, which Georgia can only aspire to. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=668.8199999999999s)]
*  At least many in Georgia can only aspire to at this point. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=672.3s)]
*  But they're both going through crisis moments. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=675.78s)]
*  Some analysts have said that this is the biggest political crisis in Romania since the Ceausescu [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=678.14s)]
*  were tossed out and executed. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=682.74s)]
*  And it's because of what you pointed to, it's one thing to be alarmed at tampering in its [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=684.74s)]
*  election, and certainly Russia has been the boogeyman in so many elections in terms of [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=689.42s)]
*  real evidence that Russia has been generating through bot farms and other tampering. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=696.0999999999999s)]
*  It's been involved in election tampering, including in Moldova, neighboring Moldova. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=701.18s)]
*  But still in all, the evidence is a bit sketchy at this point, and there is circumstantial [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=705.5s)]
*  evidence that a major heavily funded TikTok campaign elevated this candidate, Colin Ceausescu, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=710.42s)]
*  from obscurity. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=716.9s)]
*  He wasn't in the top five in polling going into the presidential vote to the lead percentage, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=717.9s)]
*  23%. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=723.06s)]
*  And it was suitably alarming that members of Romanian intelligence declassified materials [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=724.3s)]
*  to show the fact that there was virtually no spending going on for any sort of promotional [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=730.62s)]
*  campaign for Ceausescu, and yet he skyrocketed up into prominence in the polls. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=736.18s)]
*  That was enough for the Constitutional Court to say foul play, we're stopping this. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=742.78s)]
*  But that's an alarming step. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=746.42s)]
*  There's a new piece in the Journal of Democracy, which you can rely on for covering and really [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=747.42s)]
*  tracking democratic developments and being in favor of democratic developments, which [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=752.34s)]
*  said, look, this is playing with fire. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=756.58s)]
*  This is really dangerous to do something like this. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=757.86s)]
*  And it's worth pointing out the other major person polling in these results, Elena Lasconi, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=760.5s)]
*  who's the leader of the Save Romania Union. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=764.5s)]
*  She came in second with 19% of the vote. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=766.82s)]
*  She was really upset at the annulment of the vote as well. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=768.76s)]
*  Again, there's no clear sign of when it's going to be held again. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=771.1800000000001s)]
*  Presidential power in Romania is different than Georgia. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=775.02s)]
*  Georgia, it's a bit more ceremonial, but Romania, it's commander in chief of the forces there. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=778.0600000000001s)]
*  That person carries a bit more weight as head of state. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=783.1s)]
*  And it's worth saying also that they had a parliamentary vote that did go forward. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=786.02s)]
*  There are pro-Western parties that have announced they're banning into a coalition that will [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=789.34s)]
*  govern the country. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=793.0600000000001s)]
*  So not all is not, you know, forlorn in Romania, certainly. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=794.4200000000001s)]
*  It's in a much better place than Georgia. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=797.7800000000001s)]
*  But they have to sort out soon what's going to happen with this and can't have this kind [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=800.3000000000001s)]
*  of drifting situation involving its president. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=803.7s)]
*  The current president, Johannes, is going to stay in that role for the time being. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=806.0600000000001s)]
*  But you're going to start having creeping concerns, not just from the far right, which [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=810.38s)]
*  had supported Gheorghezgu, but others about how much of this is a bit of a capture of [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=814.66s)]
*  the office of presidency. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=819.86s)]
*  There's going to be some action soon in Romania. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=820.86s)]
*  Before we go on to Georgia, I'm really intrigued. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=824.5799999999999s)]
*  Is somebody going to go in and look at the mechanics of this, the notion that a TikTok [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=826.78s)]
*  campaign could be that powerful? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=831.06s)]
*  And is TikTok so, do we even know the demographics of the people who ended up voting because [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=834.6999999999999s)]
*  they were persuaded by TikTok? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=838.9399999999999s)]
*  I actually did a class last night in which I had my students who were in their 20s and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=841.58s)]
*  30s who were actually making quite a persuasive argument that they think that TikTok should [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=845.9000000000001s)]
*  be banned for anyone under 16, which I think is quite an interesting sort of backlash from [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=849.7s)]
*  young people against TikTok. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=855.26s)]
*  But have we even looked at how it affected the vote in Romania? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=856.98s)]
*  That is where a lot of focus is centering on. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=861.3000000000001s)]
*  There was an interesting report in Radio Free Europe about an influencer who's got a large [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=863.5s)]
*  following on TikTok who some reports had indicated had thrown a good deal of resources [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=868.02s)]
*  behind the George Esquick campaign. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=872.78s)]
*  He denies it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=874.5799999999999s)]
*  He did a written interview with RFERO. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=875.5799999999999s)]
*  But there's certainly some indications that he supported the George Esquick campaign in [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=877.66s)]
*  ways in which there was like a force multiplying effect and that through this TikTok campaign, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=881.02s)]
*  Romanians especially diaspora Romanians interestingly who can vote were getting more and more aware [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=886.6999999999999s)]
*  of the George Esquick campaign. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=891.74s)]
*  And again, this is why the Russian angle has become intriguing as well. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=893.34s)]
*  It was a campaign in which you heard some familiar things. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=897.02s)]
*  George Esquick is talking about a Romania for the Romanians. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=900.06s)]
*  We are not going to be dying in the fields of Ukraine, raising concerns about Romania [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=904.1s)]
*  getting thrust into a war with Russia over Ukraine. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=909.1s)]
*  So the same things we were hearing in Georgia also. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=911.98s)]
*  The same things we were hearing in Georgia. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=913.98s)]
*  And in Moldova. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=914.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=915.98s)]
*  Now, according to some of the declassified documents, TikTok itself had notified Romanian [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=916.98s)]
*  authorities that there was a number of accounts affiliated with the Russian state news agency [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=922.46s)]
*  Sputnik that had targeted users in Romania and Moldova. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=926.98s)]
*  So that's one of the links. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=930.78s)]
*  But again, there's not been a lot of concrete Russian links as of yet. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=932.1800000000001s)]
*  Circumstantial and assumptions given again, the high activity of Russia involving any [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=938.14s)]
*  elections taking place in this sphere. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=944.38s)]
*  We used to say just in the near abroad, but Russia has been active everywhere in Western [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=947.1s)]
*  Europe as well. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=949.86s)]
*  But especially in the near abroad, it wants to play a role. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=950.86s)]
*  Vyacheslav Gheorghezgu has again has said he's been asked about it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=954.42s)]
*  He said he's not a fan of Putin's. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=957.2199999999999s)]
*  He's not about being enthralled to Russia. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=959.14s)]
*  He's about making things better for Romanians. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=961.5799999999999s)]
*  But just again, the nature of his campaign coming out of nowhere, 62 year old agricultural [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=964.5799999999999s)]
*  trained professional, suddenly as the lead in the presidency gives pause. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  And this is a part of the world where you've had Slovakia recent election results going [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=975.66s)]
*  of a non-supportive of Ukraine, if not pro-Russian, certainly Hungary. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=980.86s)]
*  And there's a lot of concern that there's this kind of mounting movement in this swell [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=986.7s)]
*  of Russian support there. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=991.3000000000001s)]
*  Now on the side of Georgia, we're in a different space. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=992.82s)]
*  What you referred to was this decision, which was expected, but it still was jarring for [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=997.36s)]
*  many Georgians that they were putting off for four years EU accession talks. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1002.22s)]
*  Very much harbingers of what happened in Ukraine 10 years ago, which caused huge demonstrations [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1007.54s)]
*  and we see what we see in Ukraine now. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1012.4599999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of concern that Georgia, a much smaller country, a country that's like Ukraine, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1015.62s)]
*  also had long standing affiliations with Russia and been under the sway of Russia, 4 million [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1019.8199999999999s)]
*  people, but also a country that has had a history of kind of feistiness and people taking [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1025.34s)]
*  up arms to fight for their cause. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1031.18s)]
*  When I was covering things related to Georgia for Radio for Europe back in the 90s, there [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1034.0s)]
*  was three civil wars going on at one point and two of those actually have remained unsolved. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1038.04s)]
*  They're separatist states where Russian forces occupy, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1043.4s)]
*  So this is a country that there's a lot of concern. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1047.24s)]
*  There's another situation involving a president there. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1050.2s)]
*  At the end of this month, its president, mainly ceremonial, but still important symbolically, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1052.04s)]
*  Salome Zurabishvili. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1056.56s)]
*  Her six year term expires and she has said she's not going to be leaving office until [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1058.26s)]
*  she is satisfied that proper investigations have been done into the, first of all, the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  results of the recent parliamentary elections which saw the Georgian Dream Party emerge [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1069.0s)]
*  victorious, but also what she says is it's kind of seizure of the reins on policy towards [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1073.06s)]
*  the European Union, which is, as you say, is part of an invested, seen as an invested [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1078.72s)]
*  right for the country. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1082.96s)]
*  The footage coming out of Georgia, if it had not been for what's going on in Syria in particular, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1084.6000000000001s)]
*  I think that story would be getting a lot more of attention. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1089.28s)]
*  There's incredible footage of bravery of protesters going up to armed forces in the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1091.64s)]
*  streets, but then also the crackdown where especially opposition figures and journalists [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1096.96s)]
*  are getting beaten with truncheons and so forth. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1101.16s)]
*  And so it's resonating. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1104.24s)]
*  Zurabishvili herself, who has longstanding affiliations to France, she was born in Paris. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1105.24s)]
*  She actually met recently with President Macron and Donald Trump, who was in Paris for the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1110.0400000000002s)]
*  ceremonies around the Notre Dame reopening. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1115.2s)]
*  She's been trying to raise concern about this prying away of Georgia from Europe, which [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1118.6s)]
*  she says again is the expressed rights and expressed wish of the Georgian people. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1125.4399999999998s)]
*  Interestingly, Emmanuel Macron had a phone conversation with Ivanishvili, the billionaire [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1129.6799999999998s)]
*  you mentioned, which is a fairly rare thing. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1134.1599999999999s)]
*  He's the power behind the scene, fully acknowledged, and yet he's not serving any official role. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  And they said sort of things that were the reports that came out from the Georgian Dream [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1142.04s)]
*  Party and from the French side were very accommodating about wanting to find mutual solutions to [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1148.24s)]
*  the problem and so forth. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1153.0s)]
*  France, we should note, has played a pretty heavy role, especially in the post-Soviet [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1154.28s)]
*  Georgian history about trying to help it along. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1158.96s)]
*  It was involved in trying to bring about peace after the Russian invasion in 2008. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1162.6000000000001s)]
*  And it is trying to play an active role in mediating this problem. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1166.96s)]
*  Macron urged Ivanishvili to lessen the crackdown on protesters after seeing the disturbing [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1170.88s)]
*  images from the country. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1177.98s)]
*  And so there is a slight sort of signal of some pragmatism on the side of some of the [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1179.74s)]
*  Georgian Dream officials, if you hear them in interviews, and even Ivanishvili himself, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1185.94s)]
*  who has said he's always favored EU accession as well. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1190.3000000000002s)]
*  By the way, he has a French passport, he has ties to the West, but he's clearly also locked [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1193.98s)]
*  in with certain Russian elites and again, as you said, made his fortune in Russia. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1198.8600000000001s)]
*  And so there's a little bit of kind of balancing on a knife edge between the Russia and the [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1203.5800000000002s)]
*  West in Georgia. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1207.7s)]
*  It certainly seems like the Russian, the magnet of Russian influence is holding sway right [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1208.7s)]
*  now with the Georgian Dream, who hold a lot of the power levers. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1213.74s)]
*  And Zora Bishvili's position, will she be forcibly removed from office, let's say at [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1216.9s)]
*  the end of the month, raises a lot of concern as well. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1221.5s)]
*  So she's emerging as kind of this central figure in the state of Georgia and the way [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1224.4s)]
*  in which the country is going to proceed as a democracy or whether it's going to go down [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1229.78s)]
*  into the abyss. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1235.02s)]
*  Although once again, and I'm not saying that she's not, you know, sort of noble and concerned [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1236.02s)]
*  about the future for Europe and all of that, but does she have a right to stay in office? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1240.42s)]
*  I'm not sure you have an answer to that, but it has that sort of, are we saving democracy [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1246.06s)]
*  or not? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1250.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1251.34s)]
*  It's a valid question. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1252.34s)]
*  It's a very valid question. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1253.34s)]
*  And it's why again, in both cases, Georgia and Romania, this is tough territory to be [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1254.34s)]
*  in, and it's going to need to have cooler heads prevailing and not just sort of the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1259.18s)]
*  rule of the thug. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1263.02s)]
*  Marla, let's take a holiday from the brutality of the streets and go to the world of trade, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1265.02s)]
*  shall we? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1270.74s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1271.74s)]
*  In just a few days, the UK is, believe it or not, going to accede to the Comprehensive [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1272.74s)]
*  and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, or as the wonks like to call it, TPP. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1278.02s)]
*  This is a successor to the TPP, you may recall, but this move comes at a time in which free [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1283.9s)]
*  trade agreements are not exactly popular, certainly not in the United States. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1288.34s)]
*  So what does the UK see that it has to gain from joining this long acronym, and how will [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1292.62s)]
*  the new relationship affect trade policy, you think? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1298.1399999999999s)]
*  So what is the CPTPP, first of all? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1301.58s)]
*  So this is the consolation prize. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1304.9399999999998s)]
*  I think that's what the CP stands for. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1306.6999999999998s)]
*  It's the consolation prize after the Trump administration pulled out of the TPP. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1309.1s)]
*  And it's an agreement among 11, and this will soon be with the Brits, 12 member states, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1315.5s)]
*  some of the fastest growing economies in the world. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1320.9s)]
*  With once Britain joins, we'll have Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1324.5400000000002s)]
*  New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1331.18s)]
*  And once the Brits join, there'll be a combined gross domestic product of over $15 trillion [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1334.3400000000001s)]
*  or 15% of global GDP. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1341.38s)]
*  So it is not, as my daughter would say, I just have to get this in, it's not chocolate [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1343.42s)]
*  liver. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1348.5800000000002s)]
*  She actually said that when she was three. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1350.46s)]
*  She's now 31. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1353.02s)]
*  So why does it matter that the UK is joining? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1355.06s)]
*  Well, economically for Britain, it is actually not all that significant. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1357.82s)]
*  Britain already has trade deals with nine of the 11 members. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1361.1399999999999s)]
*  And it is estimated that UK accession is only going to contribute to the British GDP by 0.08% [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1365.02s)]
*  over the next 15 years. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1373.02s)]
*  So that is not a particularly big deal economically. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1374.86s)]
*  But there's a considerable psychic and symbolic importance to this. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1378.36s)]
*  The Brits began this, and this was a project of the previous Tory governments. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1382.28s)]
*  It was Liz Truss, remember Liz Truss? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1386.8799999999999s)]
*  And Rishi Sunak embraced this. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1390.36s)]
*  This was one of these post-Brexit, Britain is not isolated. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1392.84s)]
*  Other people want to be our best friends. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1396.6799999999998s)]
*  This is the global Britain. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1398.8s)]
*  They were going around the Commonwealth too, trying to get the Commonwealth pulled together [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1399.8s)]
*  and special deals there, right? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1403.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1404.6799999999998s)]
*  So this is the global Britain vision. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1405.68s)]
*  And so while it's not economically anywhere close to rejoining the European single market, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1407.0800000000002s)]
*  which keep in mind is a lot closer geographically and historically and all that, it's, you know, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1412.0s)]
*  there's a lot of big economies there. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1416.88s)]
*  So and it certainly makes a big political point. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1418.6000000000001s)]
*  Other people love us. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1421.44s)]
*  Other people want to trade with us. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1422.44s)]
*  And for the CPTPP, the UK accession may be an even bigger deal because Britain is the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1424.64s)]
*  first European country to sign on. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1430.0s)]
*  And it's the first country to join that is not a founding member. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1432.72s)]
*  So what it says, and particularly right now when, you know, the US is not going to join, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1436.1200000000001s)]
*  you got a president coming in who has declared the tariffs the most beautiful word in the [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1444.2s)]
*  dictionary. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1448.2s)]
*  It's a declaration that the treaty and the notion of free trade is a living, breathing [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1449.48s)]
*  and growing entity. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1453.02s)]
*  So it has a particular boost for the CPTPP and for people who believe in free trade agreements. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1454.2s)]
*  I think it's significant that you have the Brits itself join. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1459.96s)]
*  And one other thing here is that the process for the UK's admission was actually pretty [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1463.76s)]
*  significant. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1468.76s)]
*  So this is truly nerding out. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1469.96s)]
*  So I'll be brief, but I think it's worthwhile to consider it because even though they had [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1471.4s)]
*  agreements with nine of the 11 members, they really made them jump through all the hoops. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1475.56s)]
*  The Japanese oversaw this and it took more than two years. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1479.56s)]
*  And so they had to meet all of the standards for a free trade agreement. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1482.8s)]
*  They had to get chopped off on every single one of the members to join it. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1485.96s)]
*  And there were all sorts of discussions about Windsor agreements and Mead and all the other [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1489.56s)]
*  things that happens and phytosanitary rules and all the other things that they do when [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1493.3600000000001s)]
*  they do trade agreements. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1496.8400000000001s)]
*  And the reason they- [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1498.72s)]
*  I'm not going to ask you to explain phytosanitary rules. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1499.72s)]
*  I'm not even sure. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1501.1200000000001s)]
*  Is that the right word? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1502.1200000000001s)]
*  That is the right word, yes. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1503.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, thank God. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1504.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank our researcher, Helena, for that one. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1505.56s)]
*  The reason why they are so vigilant about this is that the Brits are not going to be [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1508.16s)]
*  the only ones who are applying here. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1512.96s)]
*  There are five other countries that are in the queue and the next ones in line are Taiwan [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1514.3s)]
*  and China. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1518.46s)]
*  And they know that this is very precedent setting. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1520.3s)]
*  If you bend the rules for the Brits, the other people coming after are going to want you [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1522.94s)]
*  to bend the rules. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1526.18s)]
*  So Taiwan obviously is almost a slam dunk. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1527.82s)]
*  Okay, this is an advanced market economy. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1531.34s)]
*  They've got all those wonderful chip factories. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1533.46s)]
*  Who wouldn't want them in the club? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1535.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, as it turns out, nobody really- they're going to be really nervous about putting them [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1537.06s)]
*  in without bringing the Chinese in. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1541.46s)]
*  And if you're going to put the Chinese in, you're going to have to break a lot of rules. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1544.18s)]
*  And everybody's really chastened with the experience of the WTO in which they broke [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1547.0600000000002s)]
*  all the rules for this enormous non-market economy. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1550.28s)]
*  And it didn't work out particularly well with the WTO. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1553.3s)]
*  So adhering to the rules, setting up this precedent, negotiating it the right way with [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1556.6200000000001s)]
*  the Brits was a really big deal for them. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1561.7s)]
*  And who knows what's going to happen with Taiwan and China next. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1563.7s)]
*  And then after that, you've got other countries that are going to take quite a long time, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1566.22s)]
*  Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Uruguay. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1569.9s)]
*  What they've done is they set up a precedent. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1571.78s)]
*  It's living, breathing, growing. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1574.56s)]
*  And let's see what happens with the next applicants. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1577.22s)]
*  So trade is not dead. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1580.3799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot- it sounds like a lot of interest, a lot of things going on while the US sits [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1581.3799999999999s)]
*  behind its potential tariff wall going forward. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1584.34s)]
*  The rest of the world is still trying to trade. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1587.7s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see what happens. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1589.78s)]
*  But if the US goes around picking major trade fights with not just adversaries, but with [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1591.58s)]
*  allies, the question then becomes, do people buckle under to the United States or do they [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1597.02s)]
*  move forward without us? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1604.94s)]
*  I think that, boy, would the CPTPP love the United States to join. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1606.54s)]
*  And the Chinese have this wonderful puckish way to them. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1612.02s)]
*  They were first in line. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1616.3799999999999s)]
*  They were right there with the Taiwanese saying, we want to join, we want to join. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1617.74s)]
*  The United States doesn't want to play. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1620.86s)]
*  We certainly want to play. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1622.02s)]
*  And there is a warning to this as well. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1623.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't think the Chinese are getting in any time soon because certainly with the UK there, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1626.02s)]
*  they can run interference with us. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1629.82s)]
*  They could, as the Brits would say, scupper that. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1631.18s)]
*  But if you don't play, you can't set the rules. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1634.22s)]
*  And there's a very important message in that. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1637.66s)]
*  On the other hand, the United States has an enormous amount of power and the ability to [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1640.6s)]
*  bully the world. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1643.94s)]
*  So we'll have to see who wins on this. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1644.94s)]
*  Is it tariffs or is it free trade? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1646.62s)]
*  That's going to be one of the big questions moving forward. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1648.22s)]
*  Bob, it's time to move forward with this. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1650.46s)]
*  Our audience has chosen well. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1653.02s)]
*  It's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1654.74s)]
*  And this is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1659.26s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1663.46s)]
*  And this week, our audience selected completely on our wavelength. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1664.66s)]
*  China opens anti-monopoly case against Nvidia. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1668.86s)]
*  So the US trade war with China thickens. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1673.1s)]
*  What's the latest on this? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1675.7s)]
*  And the thing I really don't understand about this, we're denying the Chinese access to [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1676.86s)]
*  really sophisticated chips. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1681.6200000000001s)]
*  And if they're having a monopoly case against Nvidia, doesn't that mean that they're going [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1684.06s)]
*  to have a harder time getting chips? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1689.62s)]
*  I don't really understand this one. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1691.5s)]
*  I think in between the lines, I agree it's complicated and I don't fully get it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1693.78s)]
*  But what I'm seeing in some of the reporting is that, yes, they're cut off, but the Chinese [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1698.0s)]
*  play the long game and they are developing capabilities to develop their own sophisticated [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1702.96s)]
*  chips and are happy enough to do that if they have to take steps like this to retaliate [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1707.06s)]
*  against the US because what this figure of the week is about is part of the tit for tat [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1712.6399999999999s)]
*  escalation going on between China and the United States. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1717.32s)]
*  You had earlier this month, the United States launching its third crackdown in three years [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  on China's semiconductor industry, curbing exports to 140 companies. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1725.08s)]
*  So this is curbing high bandwidth memory chips that are used for AI training. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1730.52s)]
*  And AI is the big thing here. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1735.56s)]
*  Nvidia's had a shrinking amount of market in China, although still significant, 16 to [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1737.6399999999999s)]
*  17 percent or so, but it's had a very large percent of the AI related chip market. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1741.8799999999999s)]
*  By the way, that market is not going away. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1747.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not ending. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1749.0s)]
*  But China announcing this monopoly proceeding is a warning shot to say it can do things [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1750.1599999999999s)]
*  like this if the US continues to try to ratchet up its controls on China. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1755.04s)]
*  It had earlier announced export bans on important elements like gallium, germanium, antimony, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1759.7s)]
*  and other high tech materials, which the US relies on heavily from China. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1766.22s)]
*  And so again, this is part of the supply chain kind of warfare going on that we might see [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1771.66s)]
*  play out. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1777.5400000000002s)]
*  Specifically, the case that seems to have aroused China is one that they had preliminarily [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1778.5400000000002s)]
*  approved about four years ago, which was the acquisition of a company called Mellanox Technologies [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1781.8600000000001s)]
*  that makes computer networking equipment. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1787.46s)]
*  And China has now come back and said, actually, there are things involved in this acquisition [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1790.46s)]
*  and this market share that smack of monopoly. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1794.5400000000002s)]
*  And so countries can do this a lot, basically, with any company the size of Nvidia is going [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1798.36s)]
*  to potentially face this. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1803.28s)]
*  But this one seemed to be clearly a Chinese move to retaliate and just try to say, look, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1804.6s)]
*  how much longer do you want to play this? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1810.32s)]
*  We have things we can do. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1811.4799999999998s)]
*  And this is another step. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1813.56s)]
*  It was noted the previous time China had probed a major tech company was 2013 against Qualcomm [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1814.56s)]
*  and Qualcomm ended up paying a nearly $1 billion fine to resolve that dispute. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1820.84s)]
*  So not sure how much farther this is going to go, but we're seeing a sort of trajectory [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1826.12s)]
*  here. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1830.9599999999998s)]
*  And it did have some impact on Nvidia's stock, didn't it? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1831.9599999999998s)]
*  It did. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1834.56s)]
*  It took a hit of about 2% to 3%, I believe. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1835.56s)]
*  It's still up on the year pretty highly, but it had a major impact on its stock. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1837.56s)]
*  This is a big trade relationship, as are many, which people need to remember, which is there [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1844.76s)]
*  are still a lot of very, very big US-China trade ties, and this is one of them. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1849.8s)]
*  We haven't heard an enormous amount as much as we've heard from the incoming Trump administration [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  about tariffs. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1860.0s)]
*  We haven't heard an enormous amount about where they stand on high tech. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  Very complex, and President Trump was, of course, first surfaced the TikTok ban and [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1867.3600000000001s)]
*  then changed his position on that as well. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1871.76s)]
*  And a look at people from Elon Musk to others that are sort of acquiring nominations and [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1874.48s)]
*  positions of influence in the administration shows potentially a real boom for tech. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1880.0400000000002s)]
*  By the way, it's also interesting to note reports today that Trump had invited Xi Jinping [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1883.96s)]
*  to his inauguration, so stay tuned to see how that one plays out. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1887.76s)]
*  Ooh, Xi at the inaugural ball. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1891.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAHHPSLwKA&t=1893.16s)]
