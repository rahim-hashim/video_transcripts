# 60th Munich Security Conference, African Union’s Conflict Agenda, Bellicose North Korea, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0)
*  In the coming week, the 60th Munich Security Conference meets at a perilous geopolitical [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=0.0s)]
*  moment, the African Union Summit confronts many conflict challenges, and North Korea [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=5.36s)]
*  celebrates the birthday of the late leader Kim Jong-il. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=9.94s)]
*  It's February 15, 2024 and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=12.36s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=27.12s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=28.12s)]
*  Well, Carla, it feels like we need to start in Europe, which is a place we tend to drift [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=29.6s)]
*  to quite a lot lately. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=34.28s)]
*  The 60th Munich Security Conference begins tomorrow and it lasts through Sunday. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=35.52s)]
*  This is a leading forum for debating international security policy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=41.46s)]
*  It's a favorite of this podcast. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  It's especially important point of contact for the transatlantic alliance. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=46.32s)]
*  And there's been quite a bit of roiling amid that alliance in the past week or so in light [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=50.72s)]
*  of the recent comments by presidential candidate and former president Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=55.3s)]
*  So is the NATO issue going to dominate the zeitgeist of Munich? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=60.1s)]
*  I love it when you do the German thing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=63.98s)]
*  Can you say the name of the hotel they're meeting in? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=66.02s)]
*  The Bayerische Hof. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=68.1s)]
*  It's a great hotel too, by the way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=71.34s)]
*  So this is the annual sort of the Davos for national security nerds. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=72.7s)]
*  Although I suspect the food and the wine are nowhere near as good. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=77.02s)]
*  More than 400 participants, you know, there can be top politicians, defense and intelligence [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=80.6s)]
*  leaders, heads of think tanks, journalists, and of course, arms manufacturers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=84.94s)]
*  We're going to be there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=88.74s)]
*  Some of the marquee names, Olaf Schultz, Kamala Harris is going to be there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=90.38s)]
*  Secretary of State Tony Blinken, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is supposed to go. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=94.1s)]
*  But no Lindsey Graham, I hear. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=98.18s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, who used to be a total devotee of the security conference, apparently is going [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=99.78s)]
*  to the border instead after visiting with President Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=105.22s)]
*  He's shifted his priorities, no longer an internationalist. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=108.5s)]
*  And King Abdullah is going to be, or Svendor Blayne is going to be there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=111.98s)]
*  And of course, this should be a drinking game, Bob. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  Everybody's betting that Vladimir Zelensky is going to be there as well. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=118.54s)]
*  They're going to also be inviting people from the global south. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  Guatemala's newly elected president is going to be there. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=125.14s)]
*  That's going to be part of their focus. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=127.42s)]
*  But as you said, the person probably most in everyone's mind is not going to be there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  And that's going to be former president and GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=133.82s)]
*  Because last week, as we discussed, you know, how Russia's invasion of Ukraine and anxiety [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=138.62s)]
*  about a possible Trump 2.0 was affecting national security thinking and somewhat defense [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=142.94s)]
*  spending in Europe and anxiety levels, you know, rose even higher over the weekend when [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=148.82s)]
*  Mr. Trump on the campaign trail told the story that he loves to tell about supposed [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=154.5s)]
*  conversation with the leader of an unnamed large NATO country in which he claimed he [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=160.74s)]
*  told this leader, you got to pay. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=166.94s)]
*  And if you don't, I'm going to tell Russia to do whatever the hell they want with them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=169.38s)]
*  As you can imagine, that has led to a major freak out. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=174.5s)]
*  So the main focus of this conference is once again going to be how reliable is the US as [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=177.78s)]
*  an ally? And with that, this question about what's going to happen with Ukraine, particularly [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=183.62s)]
*  because the Congress does not seem able to get it together. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=189.46s)]
*  Now, the good news is the Senate did finally approve funding four months after President [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=192.74s)]
*  Biden asked for it. But the prospects in the House are quite grim. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=196.98s)]
*  So is Trump coming back? Even if Trump doesn't come back, is the US a reliable partner able [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=202.1s)]
*  to support this fight against Ukraine? Will the NATO alliance hold together? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=208.5s)]
*  Those can be a big part of the discussion around the table there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=212.98s)]
*  Zelensky undoubtedly, I assume he's going to come. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=216.26s)]
*  He's going to make a very strong pitch there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=219.14s)]
*  And the Americans who were there are going to have to make a very strong pitch that we're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=221.22s)]
*  doing our best to continue to hold the alliance together and to keep the support for Ukraine [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=224.42s)]
*  flowing. So the former president gets to be in the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=228.66s)]
*  conversation at the big event. And it's also focused attention on this issue of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=231.94s)]
*  countries meeting their commitment of 2% of GDP towards defense spending. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=237.22s)]
*  There seems to be a tick up in that. If there's a bigger tick up, then the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=241.78s)]
*  former president gets to say he had influence on that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=245.3s)]
*  So it's kind of win-win for former President Trump at a conference where the report is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=248.02s)]
*  titled lose-lose, alternate universes. Yeah, you know, I mean, President Trump, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=252.5s)]
*  of course, always represents this as if this is, you know, green's fees at a golf course. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=257.54s)]
*  This has never been a question of made or dues. It's this commitment to spend 2% of your GDP. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=262.18s)]
*  And every American president has despaired over European defense spending. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=267.86s)]
*  And the lose-lose is this report that was written in the run-up to the conference. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=271.86s)]
*  And it talks about an anticipation of, you know, the conference's concern that we're looking at an [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=277.06s)]
*  increasingly transactional zero-sum world. And that, too, is a hallmark of Trump 1.0, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=282.98s)]
*  this notion that trade was all about if I win, you have to lose. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=288.9s)]
*  And that is a pretty fundamental concern. And I think that will be a focus of the conference [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=293.06s)]
*  as well. One of the interesting news developments that I think is going to perhaps focus the brain [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=298.18s)]
*  and perhaps draw the alliance together and perhaps maybe even have an impact on Washington [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=303.7s)]
*  is this news that came out on Wednesday, much to the consternation of the White House from [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=307.94s)]
*  the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee, that the Russians are moving ahead [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=312.34s)]
*  on a space-based nuclear weapon that could destroy both military and civilian communications and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  surveillance satellites. You know, we go back and forth with this question, are we an isolationist [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=320.82s)]
*  country? Are we not an isolationist country? Is the alliance going to hold together, not hold [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=325.94s)]
*  together in the face of a very increasingly assertive and frightening Russia? I think that's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=329.54s)]
*  going to be another focus as well. This is a pretty scary world out there and countries are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=335.22s)]
*  caught between is it every country for itself or are we stronger? You know, this sounds maybe like, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=340.18s)]
*  it sounds like a Ford ad, stronger together. But I think that's going to be a big part of the discussion [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=346.1s)]
*  at the conference there. How threatening are the Russians and can we make it, you know, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=351.22s)]
*  any way other than together? The report also includes some really interesting polling, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=355.54s)]
*  which was getting some buzz this week. This is called the Munich Security Index. And last year [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=360.1s)]
*  showed, you know, pretty much every country that was polled said that it was all about Russia all [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=365.62s)]
*  the time and their big fear. And this time around, Russia had fallen down on the list of people's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=370.66s)]
*  concern and countries were worried about migration caused by war and by climate change and also [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=375.94s)]
*  worried by the threat of radical Islam. And I think a lot of that has to do with the polling was [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=382.98s)]
*  done immediately after the Hamas attacks in Israel. But you know, taking the edge off their concern [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=388.26s)]
*  about Russia did not spell well for Ukraine. Certainly there's been a decline of concern in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=394.1s)]
*  the United States among the Republican Party. But when you hear about things like the Russians [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=398.74s)]
*  pushing ahead with this potentially really frightening nuclear program, and you see what's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=403.54s)]
*  going on on the ground on Ukraine, we're sort of caught between this once again, this discussion [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=408.34s)]
*  in this country and on the ground in Munich, we'll see what is the focus and how much is [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=413.61999999999995s)]
*  the Alliance going to hold together? Those are all really good points, Carla. And I think it's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=418.82s)]
*  also going to be interesting to see the dialogue that opens up with these global South countries [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=423.53999999999996s)]
*  that you mentioned that are invited to this because as some of them have been saying, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  and might even say even with the news of this space threat, a little bit of metaphorical [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=432.82s)]
*  eye rolling about, oh, here goes the West again, worrying about their problems while [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=438.74s)]
*  spending enormous amounts of money in an area where it's not necessary, there's bigger things [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=443.7s)]
*  going on and the system that they've created is faulty and needs to be reimagined. We're going [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  to be publishing on our affiliated website with the Council of Councils, a roundup of experts from [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=452.66s)]
*  around the world. And it's pegged to the two year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=457.06s)]
*  And the experts from the global South are pretty much uniformly saying, let's move towards a [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=460.9s)]
*  ceasefire. And some of them saying, let's look at a reappraisal of the security apparatus there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=465.06s)]
*  Maybe we need to consider Russia's interests vis-a-vis a NATO expansion and so forth. It's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=472.17999999999995s)]
*  all to say that it's an interesting set of views that might be on display at Munich, which is, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=478.02s)]
*  as I said, pretty much hardcore transatlantic and concerns about Russia, but there's this other [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=482.73999999999995s)]
*  voice in the room that might modulate that theme. Well, we talked about this, that a lot of countries, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=487.86s)]
*  including the United States and in the Transatlantic Alliance were utterly puzzled why [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=494.82s)]
*  global South, of course, is such a generic term, but why some countries, including countries like [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  South Africa, were not outraged by the Russians invading Ukraine. These are countries that are not [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=504.42s)]
*  overwhelmingly powerful and often threatened by their own neighbors. Why did they not see [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=511.14s)]
*  one of the fundamental international norms, the norms on which the United Nations is founded, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=517.62s)]
*  is that you don't take land by force? And why were they not outraged by what the Russians did? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=522.34s)]
*  And that this really was a warning to we, quote, the defenders of the rules-based international [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=528.18s)]
*  order, that this had to be a wake-up call for us. And that seemed to sort of slip away from the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=534.9s)]
*  conversation and the attempt to say, well, the Black Sea Grain Deal was going to be a threat to [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=539.62s)]
*  world food prices. Was this going to be the wake-up call? And none of us was the wake-up call. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=544.34s)]
*  And this Munich Security report also warns that, quote, from the perspective of the share of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=549.0600000000001s)]
*  humanity living in poverty or suffering from protracted conflicts, calls to defend the abstract [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=554.74s)]
*  rules-based order and shoulder the costs that come with it seem tone deaf. Now, this report is not [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=560.4200000000001s)]
*  saying give up on the rules-based order, but we do have to take very seriously people's sense that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=565.86s)]
*  we are only defending that order because it's great for us. We have to explain to people why [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=572.6600000000001s)]
*  it's good for them as well. So that may well be a focus of the conversation in Munich. I certainly [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=576.9000000000001s)]
*  hope it's the focus as well, because these things do reinforce each other. It's not just all about [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=582.1800000000001s)]
*  big power politics. The Western world needs to understand why rules matter. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=587.94s)]
*  Yeah. And that's going to be the fact of these people getting in the same spaces together [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=591.7800000000001s)]
*  throughout the sprawling by Erich Hoff will be important to be able to continue to carry on this [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=596.74s)]
*  discussion to be open to listening, but also to making those points that you said, Carla. I think [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=601.78s)]
*  it's a reason why Munich remains important and why it's been going on for 60 years now. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=606.9s)]
*  So, Bob, let's continue our conversation about summits. The African Union Summit, which also [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=611.78s)]
*  starts on Saturday, and the African Union leaders will meet in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=618.26s)]
*  for their 37th summit. And they have a lot to talk about as well. There's trouble in the Sahel. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=623.06s)]
*  Tensions are rising between Somalia and Ethiopia over a maritime deal with the breakaway region [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=628.66s)]
*  of Somaliland. We've talked before this huge displacement and suffering incident, civil war, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=634.0999999999999s)]
*  and those numbers just are horrifying. There's instability in the DRC and threats of war with [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=639.4599999999999s)]
*  Rwanda. There's an enormous amount there that they have to handle. Does the AU have any plans [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=644.9s)]
*  or ideas to address these multiple crises? Yeah, you've really teed it up. And a lot of those you [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=650.18s)]
*  mentioned, Carla, came from an excellent scene setter from the International Crisis Group, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=655.4599999999999s)]
*  where I'll just quote from it because it gives a backdrop to what you're saying. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=659.54s)]
*  It's part of its intro to the summit. It's saying, insurgencies bedevil countries from Mali to [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=663.6999999999999s)]
*  Mozambique. While state collapse looms in Sudan, there's the possibility of a major interstate war, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=668.66s)]
*  and tensions in the Horn and Great Lakes regions are particularly alarming. So that's a big chunk [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=674.42s)]
*  of Sub-Saharan Africa, and it's going to be filling up the summit agenda for sure. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=678.74s)]
*  But we should note that the number one thing that the crisis group listed on there, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=684.34s)]
*  among all these concerns, is how to deal better with democratic backsliding. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=688.1s)]
*  So the meeting's happening after a period in which several countries have announced they're [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=692.66s)]
*  leaving the West African group known as ECOWAS, and these countries, including Mali, Rokina Faso, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=696.1s)]
*  and Niger have had their activities suspended from the African Union. Just in the past week or so, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=701.7s)]
*  we've had Senegal's leader postponing elections until the fall after the alignment was happening [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=707.7s)]
*  for pending elections that he didn't like. And there's been military forces going into [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=713.62s)]
*  the parliament and pulling out opposition lawmakers, a very alarming display in a country [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=718.58s)]
*  that had been seen as more stable and hopefully on a road towards greater democratic stability. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=723.94s)]
*  That's not the case. So it's going to be important for the AU leaders to talk about that. They had [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=729.1400000000001s)]
*  been taking a growing role in trying to create a ground floor for democratic norms and for observing [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=734.26s)]
*  them and what to do when countries vary from those, but then also playing a really important [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=742.98s)]
*  role in peacekeeping. Africa continues to this day to dominate global peacekeeping efforts and [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=747.54s)]
*  resources. It's the focal point of UN peacekeeping certainly, and UN has increasingly seated or [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=753.54s)]
*  collaborated with the African Union to make sure certain missions can be staffed and resourced and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=759.62s)]
*  so forth. African Union continues to play a role in Somalia. And as you said, Somalia now finds [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=764.58s)]
*  itself at odds with the host nation of the AU summit, Ethiopia, over this port agreement [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=769.7s)]
*  involving Somaliland. So it's going to be a summit in which it's going to be really important issues [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=774.42s)]
*  on the table, but also a sense of how is this AU organization going to prioritize these major, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=779.46s)]
*  either existing or looming conflicts? And then what kind of shape is it to basically resource [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=785.94s)]
*  the efforts needed to mediate, to provide peacekeeping? Some of the African peacekeeping [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=791.7800000000001s)]
*  initiatives are not just uniformed forces patrolling streets and separating sides, but [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=797.7s)]
*  it's mediation efforts. It's dealing with other sort of what they call confidence building efforts. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=803.3000000000001s)]
*  And that takes time, it takes patience, but it takes presence and it takes credibility. And so [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=808.1s)]
*  it's a really big moment for the African Union. And so I think it could get certainly overshadowed [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=812.82s)]
*  in some of the other press coverage of places like Munich, but I think it's going to be worth [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=816.98s)]
*  watching what comes out of Addis and whether it's showing a sense of resolve or a sense of resignation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=820.1800000000001s)]
*  AMT – The AU's outgoing chairperson was the president of the Union of Comoros. And [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=826.98s)]
*  he made quite a big deal, rightly about rising sea levels and the blue economy. And it's not all about [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=834.82s)]
*  war. Also, obviously climate displacement also leads to the huge national security problems. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=844.9s)]
*  Did they make any progress on that topic during his tenure? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=852.58s)]
*  BF – I think the one bit of progress to point to is just having it on the agenda and having a voice [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=855.94s)]
*  on that and having the fact of these countries that, for example, if you look at the various [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=860.42s)]
*  data views around carbon emissions and impacts from extreme climate, there's an incredibly [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=865.3s)]
*  disproportionality between what sort of emissions are generated by Africa, which obviously relates [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=871.3s)]
*  to the continent's industrialization or lack of, and then what it's dealing with in terms of drought, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=876.3399999999999s)]
*  in terms of rising sea levels, in terms of all sorts of things. So I think getting that on [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=882.3399999999999s)]
*  an agenda at places like the COP meetings at the end of the year, but also having their own summits [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=886.42s)]
*  organized in Africa to draw attention to this have been important and important as a way of building [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=890.8199999999999s)]
*  a groundswell of support for these kind of lost damage funds that are also increasingly on agendas [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=896.0999999999999s)]
*  at meetings like COP at various global forums where you have richer countries that have benefited [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=902.02s)]
*  from industrialization and from intense carbon emissions to sort of remind them that there are [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=907.4599999999999s)]
*  countries that are disproportionately paying the cost. So I would say in terms of that, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=912.26s)]
*  in terms of raising it as an issue, I'm not sure about the concrete impact, Carla, as in so many [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=916.42s)]
*  other areas in the climate front, it tends to grind along pretty slowly. And so that is also [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=921.54s)]
*  something when you're in the midst of all these looming conflicts or concerns about conflicts or [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=926.9s)]
*  concerns about democracy, climate's going to take a back seat. And so I'm not sure how much we'll see [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=931.14s)]
*  it come up at this particular summit, but it is interesting to mention also the leadership or the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=935.38s)]
*  chairmanship of the next session, which will fall to either Morocco or Algeria. And they're getting [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=940.66s)]
*  into a bit of a face off over that issue. Do we have a dog in the fight? You put money on it? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=945.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay. So I should add one other thing that the US has its top African officials attending this [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=953.38s)]
*  summit as always. And I think it's going to be keenly interested in both being a presence there, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=958.18s)]
*  being seen as an interlocutor at a time when you have countries like certainly China and [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=964.1s)]
*  its massive infrastructure efforts, but also Russia and being invited by countries, especially [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=969.94s)]
*  in West Africa to step in and help out in peacekeeping. That's also has certainly gotten [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=975.3000000000001s)]
*  the attention of the US and European states. Was that peacekeeping with air quotes around it? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=980.5s)]
*  That's air quotes, major air quotes around that. That was like Wagner Group. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=985.0600000000001s)]
*  That's major Wagner Group presence. Wagner Group peacekeeping. Is there the same or close to the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=988.4200000000001s)]
*  same level of anxiety in the AU at the potential presidential transition in this country in that [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=995.38s)]
*  the US retreat or is there potential relief at the notion that we're not going to be so engaged in [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1002.5s)]
*  the world? That is an issue to watch. It's sort of consuming all the oxygen seemingly in Europe [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1008.1s)]
*  right now, but in Africa, it's not clear. I think African nations in the past resented some of the [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1013.54s)]
*  blunter comments of President Trump regarding their nations, but- [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1018.74s)]
*  We can't say them in a family podcast. No, we cannot say that on a family podcast. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1022.18s)]
*  By the same notion, it was a bit of neglect that they weren't necessarily bothered by, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1026.18s)]
*  but others were because again, it was a bit of a tension deficit that allowed certainly an [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1030.42s)]
*  acceleration of Chinese and Russian interests on the continent. I think some would say. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1035.7800000000002s)]
*  But Carla, let's move across the globe to North Korea of all places. They are marking a birthday, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1040.42s)]
*  the 83rd birthday of Kim Jong-il, who is the late father of Kim Jong-un, the current leader of North [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1046.2600000000002s)]
*  Korea. Now, festivities are coming at a time when North Korea is asserting itself in new and [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1052.02s)]
*  concerning ways. In the last week, Kim moved to halt efforts for reconciliation with its [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1058.42s)]
*  southern neighbor, South Korea, and even threatening to go nuclear if provoked. It has [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1063.3799999999999s)]
*  been cozying up to Russia. It has become more of an arms supplier to countries like Russia, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1068.82s)]
*  and it has been very active in recent years in the cyber realm as well and hacking and [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1075.54s)]
*  ransomware attacks and so forth. But it all adds up to an escalation coming out of Pyongyang, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1080.98s)]
*  seemingly. Carla, do you know what's leading to this escalation and is there a US role in [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1085.8600000000001s)]
*  the escalating? So it's intriguing to think about how this birthday and this latest escalation fit [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1089.8600000000001s)]
*  together or actually how they sort of compete against each other. North Korea is a country [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1095.94s)]
*  built on a cult of personality and the cult of Kim Il-sung, who's the country's founder and [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1101.54s)]
*  the current Kim, Kim Jong-un's grandfather and the father of the guy whose birthday we're going to be [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1108.82s)]
*  celebrating. It is long believed that that cult is such a big deal that the current Kim had plastic [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1113.54s)]
*  surgery before succeeding to the throne to make him look even more like his grandfather. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1120.02s)]
*  For years, his haircut and his clothes, horned glasses, the mouse suits were clearly styled to [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1125.1399999999999s)]
*  mimic the old man. We know so little about what goes on there that when the current Kim shifted [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1130.02s)]
*  his sartorial choices and even made news in the West. So we watch all of these things, how much do [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1136.98s)]
*  they celebrate the birthdays? Is dad less popular than grandpa? All of these things. This is as close [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1143.14s)]
*  as we get to understanding what goes on in the heads of these people, all of which makes Kim's [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1149.06s)]
*  recent defiant break with family precedent even more surprising. This all started in mid-January, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1154.34s)]
*  actually, when he declared to his parliament that North Korea was abandoning his father's longstanding [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1160.34s)]
*  objective of peaceful unification with South Korea. He said he wanted to, quote, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1165.94s)]
*  shake off the unrealistic pretense of dialogue and cooperation. Kim is really never a man who does [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1171.38s)]
*  anything by half. He ordered a rewriting of North Korea's constitution to define the South as its [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1177.3s)]
*  most hostile foreign adversary. He ordered the dismantlement of all state agencies responsible [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1183.22s)]
*  for reconciliation with the South. Satellite photos show that the government in late January [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1188.5s)]
*  demolished this nine-story arch of reunification built by his father. In February, he said he had [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1193.86s)]
*  no desire for diplomacy and, as you said, started to beat the nuclear drum. As for what's really [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1200.82s)]
*  going on, some experts warn that the North might actually be getting ready for war, but pretty much [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1207.9399999999998s)]
*  everybody else sees this as another bid for attention. Kim really tends to have hissy fits [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1213.3s)]
*  when he's being ignored and the Biden administration, which is focused a lot more on encouraging a [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1218.6599999999999s)]
*  rapprochement between Seoul and Tokyo. Now, of course, Ukraine and Gaza have taken all of the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1223.54s)]
*  oxygen, so pretty much everyone's been ignoring him. This is more than anything else probably a [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1228.6599999999999s)]
*  bid for attention and a bid for more aid, lifting sanctions, whatever it is he's looking for. Kim may [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1233.94s)]
*  also be posturing as a way to bolster his new romance with Putin and Russia. If the White House [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1240.42s)]
*  is focused on anything, it's that relationship that they find more concerning than the possibility [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1246.02s)]
*  of an all-out war. Yangyang is sending artillery shells and short-range ballistic missiles to Russia [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1251.54s)]
*  and all that is already showing up on the battlefield in Ukraine. In exchange, the North [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1257.62s)]
*  is supposedly getting cash and advanced satellite missile technology and anything that boosts its [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1263.1399999999999s)]
*  missile development program and its potential to sell this stuff to other rogue states is really, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1268.42s)]
*  really worrying. Could things go awry always? Because we all know that the North Koreans do [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1272.8999999999999s)]
*  wacky things, occasionally shelling South Korean islands, occasionally throwing stuff over Japan. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1281.22s)]
*  So things could go poorly. We have a whole bunch of troops in South Korea and they do have nuclear [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1287.8600000000001s)]
*  weapons. But more than anything else, people are watching that relationship with Russia. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1293.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and Russia was part of this diplomatic effort that seems like a very long time ago. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1299.22s)]
*  It wasn't terribly, but that involved Kim's father, which I think was called the Six-Party [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1305.6200000000001s)]
*  Talks. It had a goal of denuclearizing North Korea with all sorts of carrots thrown in, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1309.62s)]
*  including assurances about its security and so forth that would allow it to open up its facilities. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1315.3799999999999s)]
*  It did for a fairly brief moment allow that to happen or at least dismantle some, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1321.62s)]
*  I think plutonium-related facilities. Yeah, they canned fuel. They did do that. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1326.5s)]
*  Yeah. Americans actually went in and were part of that. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1330.1s)]
*  And Americans went in and this was again, as you noted, in the midst of time of the two Koreas [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1332.5s)]
*  being engaged in various enterprises and this sense of, okay, well, they're clearly through [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1338.3400000000001s)]
*  working together through shared growth and some economic ties, we can make this thing work. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1343.94s)]
*  It just feels very far away from that right now. And you're right, we do tend to see these [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1348.3400000000001s)]
*  surges in rhetoric and other things and testing plans and so forth when other things preoccupy [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1352.42s)]
*  the world. And Kim, by possessing a growing number of nuclear weapons and a growing capability to [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1358.5800000000002s)]
*  mount them onto warheads that can travel thousands of miles, is able to get attention [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1364.5s)]
*  quite quickly when he reminds everybody of that. So it's just of all the panoply, for want of a [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1368.98s)]
*  better term, that problems going on, this is a recurring big one. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1374.9s)]
*  Well, of course, the last flutter of enthusiasm did come during the Trump administration when [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1378.42s)]
*  President Trump met with this Kim and stepped over the border there. But it wasn't clear what [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1384.5s)]
*  the United States was asking for. And I think there's a really pretty fundamental question, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1392.98s)]
*  and I think this is true in any nuclear negotiation, which is would the North ever [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1396.9s)]
*  give up its nuclear weapons? And that's been a pretty big question all along from the beginning. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1402.02s)]
*  Unfortunately, nuclear weapons guarantee regime survival and autocrats know that, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1407.7s)]
*  which doesn't mean it's not an admirable goal and one that we would all very much like to see, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1413.06s)]
*  because the potential for miscalculation was a nuclear state, particularly one [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1417.38s)]
*  that is so opaque and so hard to read, which is why we spend so much time looking at the guy's [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1421.86s)]
*  clothes and trying to figure out what's going on inside his head and reading things like why did [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1426.02s)]
*  he demolish an arch built by his father, which is why we'll also be looking at how big is the [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1430.58s)]
*  birthday celebration to try to figure out what's going on inside his head when he has just renounced [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1435.6999999999998s)]
*  a policy that was his father's policy. This is a really hard place to read, and it's particularly [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1439.54s)]
*  scary because he's got enough nuclear fuel for 50 or perhaps 60 warheads, and we've got more than [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1445.78s)]
*  28,000 US troops still based in South Korea, pretty fraught. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1453.86s)]
*  And not to mention bases in Guam and other places that could be targets. We should note there's a [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1456.82s)]
*  recent piece from our colleague Scott Snyder that kind of lays out what the latest trajectory of [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1461.7s)]
*  North Korean actions and their capabilities. Trajectory. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1465.86s)]
*  Trajectory. Always a good verb when you're talking [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1469.06s)]
*  about North Korea. Oh, yes. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1471.06s)]
*  So, Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1473.3799999999999s)]
*  And this is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1479.06s)]
*  Instagram story. And this week, Bob, our audience selected Shabazz Sharif, nominated Pakistan's PM. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1484.1799999999998s)]
*  So, Bob, we've talked about this with Imran Khan blocked from running. We were predicting [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1491.06s)]
*  a Sharif would get the job, but we just thought it was going to be his brother Nawaz Sharif. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1496.02s)]
*  So what happened? This is a different Sharif. It is a different Sharif. And let's not underscore [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1500.5s)]
*  the capability of dynastic politics to prevail in Pakistan. And so Shabazz is the younger brother [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1507.38s)]
*  of Nawaz. And Nawaz, according to his daughter, had indicated that he was not interested in running [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1514.66s)]
*  what appeared to be a minority coalition government after having been involved in running [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1522.9s)]
*  majority governments. And so the baton was passed to Shabazz. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1527.54s)]
*  Shabazz has done this before. Who has done this before in recent history. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1532.5s)]
*  But this all came out of a surprising election result in which people who were supporters of [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1536.26s)]
*  Imran Khan were able to run not through the party of Imran Khan, but were able to run as independents [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1541.06s)]
*  and did quite well. And they did quite well in part by dint of the enduring popularity of Khan, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1547.14s)]
*  who initially was supported by the very powerful military of Pakistan, but has run afoul of them. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1554.66s)]
*  But they were able to make use of all sorts of technical means, high-tech means to get the word [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1559.8600000000001s)]
*  out, including fascinating reports about using artificial intelligence. I'll just cite one of [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1565.7s)]
*  them that I came across. Through messages conveyed to Khan's lawyers, Khan was able to get information [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1570.1000000000001s)]
*  out to his party supporters who then use technology to generate content in his own voice, which then [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1577.0600000000002s)]
*  basically ensured that he could reach millions of Pakistanis ahead of the polls and after the polls [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1583.38s)]
*  to keep the base energized, to keep them fired up, but more importantly to go to the polls and [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1588.9s)]
*  create this turnout, which showed them winning a large number of seats. They won 92 seats, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1593.22s)]
*  the most of any party. The now two other acronym parties I'm going to name, the PMLN, which is the [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1597.94s)]
*  party of the Sharifs, and the PPP party, which is the other main party in the country. They won the [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1603.8600000000001s)]
*  second and third most seats and are forming this coalition. We'll see how long it lasts there. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1610.18s)]
*  These are two parties from different sides of the spectrum, and both have been leadership at [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1615.14s)]
*  different times. Again, the military calls the shots in the country, but we'll see whether Shabazz [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1619.94s)]
*  is going to be a caretaker only, whether Khan has any sort of increasing or enduring staying power, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1625.8600000000001s)]
*  or what's going to happen. As you said in the setup to these elections in our podcast a couple [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1631.6200000000001s)]
*  of weeks ago, Carla, there's so much going on. This country needs a little bout of stability [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1635.94s)]
*  to be able to try to sort out its severe economic problems, its severe security problems, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1639.86s)]
*  and just kind of create a little bit of political stability to try to forge ahead. But this is [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1644.8999999999999s)]
*  anything but. Sorry. What did we say? I think it was not even last week. I think we said that [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1650.02s)]
*  no prime minister has ever completed his term. That's correct. Yeah. Do we know what they're [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1657.62s)]
*  promising? Do we know what they're saying they're going to do, or is this all just basically they're [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1662.02s)]
*  doing whatever the military is going to tell them to do? I think it's going to be kind of same old, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1666.58s)]
*  same old, like not rocking the boat too much is fair to say. First of all, they have to get [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1670.74s)]
*  control of the narrative in some way and indicate that they are legitimately forming this government [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1675.1399999999999s)]
*  and can serve. Because again, even with those artificial intelligence successes of the Khan [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1680.74s)]
*  supporters, there are a lot of allegations of misuse happening by the military, of censorship, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1685.62s)]
*  of locking down the internet. By the way, Khan supporters have also been accused of online [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1692.58s)]
*  trolling and misinformation and so forth. So there's a lot of that going around. But again, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1697.86s)]
*  this ruling coalition, which our colleague Josh Karlandzik says is going to be pretty weak, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1701.78s)]
*  is going to have to try to get the narrative going that it's in power and that it's going to be able [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1706.02s)]
*  to deliver for the people. I think economic is going to be really important. I'm not sure what [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1710.1799999999998s)]
*  the program is for that, frankly. I think the army is trying to pacify certain areas, including with [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1714.1s)]
*  the always restive Baluchis in the south, but also it's got Northwest concerns as well. And it has [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1719.62s)]
*  to sort out its relationship with the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan, which have been in a [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1726.1s)]
*  bad way recently. So I think we're just going to kind of see, first of all, how they can consolidate, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1730.4199999999998s)]
*  move ahead and start to see how they can govern. And whether or not Khan continues to press the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1735.3s)]
*  pedal to the metal and try to challenge the results, try to foment unrest and really create [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1740.02s)]
*  some sort of disruption that might cause him to be put away and out of sight and out of contact [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1746.18s)]
*  with his supporters at all. Well, I suspect we will be discussing this. I see the US and the Brits [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1751.94s)]
*  are calling for investigations into claims of interference or fraud. I suspect that's not going [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzPgoLs1V0&t=1758.5800000000002s)]
