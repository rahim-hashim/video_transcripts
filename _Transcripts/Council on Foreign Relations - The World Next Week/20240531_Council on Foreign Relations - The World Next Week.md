# Biden’s Gaza Dilemmas, 80 Years Since D-Day, Mexico’s Milestone Election, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4)
*  In the coming week, the Biden administration faces increasing pressure over its Gaza policy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=0.0s)]
*  Western leaders commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, and Mexico prepares to elect its [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=6.2s)]
*  first female president. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=10.76s)]
*  It's May 30th, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=12.64s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=27.52s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=28.68s)]
*  Carla, let's start in Gaza. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=29.68s)]
*  On Tuesday, the Pentagon announced that the U.S. built pier that had been set up supposedly [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=32.0s)]
*  to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza had become inoperable due to damage from heavy seas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=37.1s)]
*  And with the suspension of this pier, the closing of the Rafa crossing, humanitarian [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=43.28s)]
*  officials are warning of a collapse, essentially, in the enclave where people are already in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=47.0s)]
*  a very treacherous state. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  On top of the urgency of this situation, the recent Israeli strike on tent camps in Rafa [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=55.18s)]
*  that was targeting Hamas officials but also killed a number of civilians has added international [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  scrutiny to what had already been scrutiny of U.S. support for Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=66.5s)]
*  There's new estimation from Israeli officials that this campaign is going on through the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  end of the year. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=75.3s)]
*  So how is the Biden administration looking to deal with all of these challenges? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=76.58s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=80.42s)]
*  This is just so grim, Bob. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=82.42s)]
*  The story of the pier is one more reminder of how incredibly difficult and heart-rending [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=85.1s)]
*  this situation is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=90.46s)]
*  President Biden first announced during the State of the Union in March that the U.S. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=91.82s)]
*  was going to build this pier to try to relieve some of the hunger in Gaza. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=96.1s)]
*  The Pentagon was surprised and really skeptical, not so much because of the technical challenges [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=100.38s)]
*  involved. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. has done similar projects for humanitarian relief in Haiti, in Somalia, and in Kuwait. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=105.97999999999999s)]
*  But what worried Pentagon officials at the time and others is what would happen to the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=111.3s)]
*  aid once it left the pier. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=114.9s)]
*  U.S. troops are banned by the White House from operating in Gaza. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=116.5s)]
*  And so the delivery process was always going to be left to the Israelis to decide when [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=120.42s)]
*  it went, where it went, and they're certainly less than sympathetic to the effort. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=125.22s)]
*  And to poorly defended aid groups, and once the pier became operational on May 17th, it [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=129.52s)]
*  seemed like anything that could go wrong did go wrong. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=135.26s)]
*  Trucks were looted on their way from the pier to the warehouses. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=138.70000000000002s)]
*  And distribution convoys, and we talked about this Bob, were stormed by starving people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=141.94s)]
*  And delivery operations had to be suspended several times. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=146.42s)]
*  And then on Sunday, the Pentagon announced that part of this 1800-foot causeway that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  connects what was a large floating dock to the pier, which was tethered to land, had [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=154.7s)]
*  broken apart in rough seas. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=159.46s)]
*  It had to be towed to Ashdod in southern Israel for repairs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=160.94s)]
*  And the Pentagon is saying optimistically that it could take a little over a week, weather [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=164.06s)]
*  permitting, to get it back in play. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=169.46s)]
*  But in under two weeks, the pier was operating. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  The UN reported it transported a total of 137 trucks of aid. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=176.02s)]
*  And American officials had hoped that at top capacity, the pier would be delivering the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=181.26s)]
*  equivalent of 150 truckloads of aid a day. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  And even that was only going to be maybe a third of the amount USAID and UN says are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=189.5s)]
*  needed daily to address the humanitarian disaster in Gaza. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=195.42s)]
*  So this was a good idea, certainly a portion of what was desperately needed. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=199.33999999999997s)]
*  But really, yes, let's hope they get it back working. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=205.22s)]
*  But just one more sign of how incredibly hard it is to operate there and how disastrous [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  the whole situation is. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems unwilling to listen to anyone's advice, certainly not [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=218.82s)]
*  his war cabinet, and not willing to listen to Biden's advice about the cost, including [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=223.26s)]
*  to Israel, of what has become an increasingly indiscriminate war. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=227.94s)]
*  And Biden seems unwilling to risk a permanent break in his relationship with Israel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=232.18s)]
*  The White House tied itself into verbal knots on Tuesday when it said that Israel had not [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=237.34s)]
*  crossed Biden's own red line on Ra'afah after this airstrike that you mentioned, Bob, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=241.06s)]
*  killed 45 Palestinians, many of them children and injured hundreds of people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=245.78s)]
*  Biden had said the US would suspend delivery of offensive weapons to Israel if it went [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=251.62s)]
*  into quote population centers in Ra'afah. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=255.54s)]
*  But White House spokesman John Kirby said that Israel had not quote, started a major [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=258.56s)]
*  ground operation in the city. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=262.58s)]
*  The Israelis must have been listening on Wednesday Israeli National Security Advisor said he [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=265.66s)]
*  expected the campaign in Gaza to continue through the end of the year. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=269.74s)]
*  So not a lot of influence there, a lot of tying themselves into knots and nothing seems [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=273.58s)]
*  to be going right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=279.44s)]
*  Well, on top of all this, you have signs of new frictions between Israelis and the Egyptians. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=280.68s)]
*  There are reports ahead of this podcast tape in Carla that Israel had been able to establish [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=286.92s)]
*  control over the full border area where Gaza borders Egypt. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=292.12s)]
*  And there had been an incident earlier in the week in which an Egyptian soldier was [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=297.12s)]
*  killed and the Israelis were investigating that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=300.32s)]
*  Obviously a very important relationship to maintain and to maintain in a calm way. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=303.72s)]
*  The Egyptians are especially concerned about an influx of Palestinians and sort of the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=308.2s)]
*  exporting of instability into their own country as this continues to play out. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  Is that particular dynamic potentially going to help create some sort of clarity on Ra'afah [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=318.24s)]
*  or are we still just sort of seeing a military campaign play out and there's going to be [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=323.46s)]
*  collateral damage? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=328.2s)]
*  So we don't know exactly how much control or how large an area. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  The military announced they had, quote, tactical control of this border strip between Gaza [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=334.84s)]
*  and Egypt. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=339.44s)]
*  We know that Cairo is furious, they're furious about this soldier that got shot. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=340.44s)]
*  They'd been warning them about not trying to seize this area itself. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=343.64s)]
*  The Israelis insist they need this as part of their attempt to wipe out Hamas. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  But this relationship is an important relationship. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=353.32s)]
*  It's an important relationship for the United States. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  We can debate whether, you know, Sisi's the guy you want to have a relationship with. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  It's an important relationship for trying to negotiate some sort of ceasefire for a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=360.76s)]
*  hostage deal. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=364.64s)]
*  Cairo's often hosts these negotiations. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=365.64s)]
*  Alienating one more neighbor, raising tensions is not a great thing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=369.2s)]
*  And this is one more trouble that Biden has. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=374.24s)]
*  And Biden also has got these political problems at home, Bob, that he's got to deal with. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about what he's facing in his own chambers in Washington? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=381.28s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson's been proudly crowing about inviting Netanyahu to speak to a joint [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  session of Congress and quote, calling Senator Majority Leader Schumer's bluff to co-sign [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=390.32s)]
*  this invitation letter. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=396.48s)]
*  I don't know whether the letter's gone out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=397.8s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz says he's planning to file a war powers resolution that would, if it [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=400.48s)]
*  passes, force the administration to abandon the Gaza peer altogether. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=404.48s)]
*  I don't know if that itself is going to go forward. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  But so you have the problems with Egypt, you've got the problems in Washington, you've got [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=409.84s)]
*  the problems with the peer. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=413.28s)]
*  This is a really hard situation to manage for the United States, but it's just everywhere [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=415.26s)]
*  you look right now, it's just really a disaster. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=419.68s)]
*  And it's been a particularly hard front for the U.S. to try to unpack or disconnect the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=422.68s)]
*  humanitarian policy from Israel's war aims, obviously. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  And some of this is just, as you said at the outset, coming up with some sort of plan if [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=434.28s)]
*  there is going to be a peer or if that's going to be a fixture in the horizon in the months, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=439.12s)]
*  maybe even years ahead, what is the process in which goods coming over that peer are safeguarded [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=444.2s)]
*  and brought into the public in a coherent way, and just doesn't seem to exist at all, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=449.7s)]
*  let alone the viability of a peer getting hit by ocean currents and waves and so forth. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=454.22s)]
*  This question about the future of Gaza, the United States supposedly has a plan, it's [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=459.7s)]
*  all caught up in the two-state solution, some sort of big deal with the Saudis. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=465.3s)]
*  But Netanyahu says he's not giving it up. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=469.86s)]
*  And it's really his own coalition, his war cabinet was threatening to tear itself apart [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=473.34000000000003s)]
*  over this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=477.56s)]
*  Netanyahu's got to work out his deal with his own people, and the United States, which [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=478.96s)]
*  supposedly has influence over the Israelis, has got to push a hell of a lot harder than [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=483.76s)]
*  it's been pushing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=488.32s)]
*  This day after plan is absolutely essential, but right now getting aid to people and limiting [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=489.52s)]
*  the vast civilian casualties is also absolutely essential. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=496.72s)]
*  Bob, happier note, as much as a memorial can be a happy note. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=500.56s)]
*  Next Thursday is the 80th anniversary of D-Day. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=504.72s)]
*  This is the Allied invasion of Normandy in World War II that led to the liberation of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=506.92s)]
*  France and the beginning of the end of the war. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=510.2s)]
*  Is this going to be just a ceremonial event, or is there going to be substance? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=514.0s)]
*  Several heads of state are going to be there, and you've got a current war on Europe that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  really matters with Ukraine. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=522.28s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=523.96s)]
*  And those two are going to be intertwined as this anniversary is marked, and partly it's [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=525.4s)]
*  because of the guest list. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=530.2s)]
*  The latest report I saw, President Biden is going to be in attendance, Canadian Prime [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=532.68s)]
*  Minister Justin Trudeau, Rishi Sunak is invited, I believe he's going to attend German Chancellor [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=536.9599999999999s)]
*  Olaf Scholz, and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  And that is significant, obviously, because of the current state of the transatlantic [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  alliance and its posture towards Ukraine and its increasing discussions about enabling [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  materials provided to Ukraine to be used against Russian territory. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=556.4799999999999s)]
*  That issue is front and center. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=561.08s)]
*  As we were taping this podcast, it was being discussed rather intensely by NATO foreign [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=562.32s)]
*  ministers in Prague. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  And there are different opinions among the alliance about how vigorous to be in allowing [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=568.88s)]
*  Ukrainians to use this material. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=573.74s)]
*  The US was particularly alarmed that Ukraine had been attacking sites that had housed Russian [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  radar facilities that were dealing with nuclear alert systems. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=580.94s)]
*  This gets really tricky and really, really serious, because if there is a fracturing [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  in the confidence and in the reliability of those types of facilities, you're talking [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  about a completely different order of problem involving Russia and Western countries, including [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  the United States and including nuclear readiness. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=600.2s)]
*  So I think that has to be crystal clear about what is and what is not allowed to be targeted, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=603.64s)]
*  for one thing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=609.12s)]
*  And then I think you continue to see the formulation the US is saying, which is Ukraine's going [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=610.24s)]
*  to make the decisions it needs to make to defend itself and then sort of hide behind [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=614.6s)]
*  that for the moment. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=618.7s)]
*  So that's going to play out. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=620.1s)]
*  The anniversary itself, though, it's worth noting. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=621.9000000000001s)]
*  First of all, because it's the 80th anniversary, this really will be the last big anniversary [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=623.7800000000001s)]
*  in which many of these veterans, remarkable veterans that are still alive, can be there [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=627.86s)]
*  in person to commemorate. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=633.1s)]
*  I had the great fortune of being able to visit those beaches right around the 49th anniversary. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=634.82s)]
*  I went with my father, who was part of a field hospital that arrived a couple of weeks after [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=638.98s)]
*  But he had rich, resonant memories of Omaha Beach when he arrived. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=644.92s)]
*  And going to those sites in the 90s, it was remarkable because they were unchanged. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=649.92s)]
*  The French left them as is. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=654.56s)]
*  The cemeteries that are nearby are stunning and unmoving. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=656.92s)]
*  And the sacrifice that was involved by the 160,000 or so troops from the UK, United States, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=661.0999999999999s)]
*  Canada, and other nations there is still awe-inspiring. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=667.12s)]
*  And it should be noted that they were in alliance with the Soviet Union, which had [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=671.08s)]
*  borne the brunt of the Nazi war effort. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=674.26s)]
*  Certainly up to that point, the biggest battles in the war were fought on the Soviet-Nazi [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=678.08s)]
*  front and Russians will remind their counterparts of that on every occasion. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=682.2s)]
*  It was noted that Macron did not invite Vladimir Putin to this anniversary, but did say he [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=686.76s)]
*  was going to extend an invite to a Russian representative. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not clear yet whether there is going to be any Russians showing up there. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=694.6s)]
*  Certainly will be interesting if a Russian shows up while Vladimir Zelensky is around [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=698.72s)]
*  or in the room, so to speak. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=702.88s)]
*  But it does raise the question about past relationships with Russia and when common [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=705.0600000000001s)]
*  cause was made, difficult moment, and what this anniversary means for the alliance and [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=709.96s)]
*  for standing up to aggression and tyranny and real threats to collective security. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=715.6s)]
*  So of course, if he had invited Putin, then he could have arrested him and sent him to [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=721.76s)]
*  the Hague since he's under indictment. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=725.96s)]
*  The ICC. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=728.44s)]
*  There's that as well, yes. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=729.44s)]
*  Politico had this quote from one anonymous White House official. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=732.08s)]
*  The White House seemed sort of peevish that Macron had invited any Russian, but this White [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=736.9200000000001s)]
*  House official said, at least it might remind the Russians that they actually fought real [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=741.46s)]
*  Nazis once, not imaginary ones in Ukraine, which I thought was quite to the point. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=746.2s)]
*  This is the beginning of a series of meetings in which Ukraine is likely going to be the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=752.12s)]
*  major focus. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=757.68s)]
*  I mean, you've got a big NATO summit, you've got G7 coming up. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=758.68s)]
*  And we've joked a lot about Zelensky. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=763.3199999999999s)]
*  He's everywhere, he's everywhere. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=765.4799999999999s)]
*  But he hadn't been traveling because things are so dire. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=766.4799999999999s)]
*  And he is making a really compelling case these days that things are so desperate. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=770.76s)]
*  And why is NATO at a minimum not shooting down things coming into his airspace? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=777.56s)]
*  Maybe not necessarily Russian planes, but certainly missiles. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=784.52s)]
*  This is something, an argument he started making at the time when the US helped defend [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=787.4s)]
*  Israel from the onslaught from Iran. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=791.88s)]
*  And we noted it at the time, quite an interesting argument. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=794.26s)]
*  It seems like there's a shift going on. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=797.86s)]
*  Certainly the Brits are much more proactive in their argument, but the Ukrainians can [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  use equipment to go after Russian territory. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=804.64s)]
*  French, much more. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=807.64s)]
*  The Germans seem to be shifting in that direction. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  The Americans seem very resistant to it. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=811.72s)]
*  Do you think that these summits are going to push forward into a more active role, taking [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=814.76s)]
*  it on? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=819.92s)]
*  Because it seems like Ukraine needs it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=820.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think I would say, again, vis-a-vis the discussion of allowing Ukrainian forces [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=822.36s)]
*  to use acquired Western military material in Russia versus protecting Ukraine in other [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=827.64s)]
*  ways. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=834.28s)]
*  I think that is going to be fair game. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=835.28s)]
*  And I think you are going to see the administration try to square that and step up efforts to [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=836.96s)]
*  try to help Ukraine. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=841.56s)]
*  Part of this problem is just what's available to help them. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=843.32s)]
*  We've mentioned previously in our discussions on this, are there available Patriot missile [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=847.6s)]
*  batteries that can be provided, for example? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=850.48s)]
*  There are other systems that which have been readily supplied to Israel that in some way [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=853.24s)]
*  could be brought into Ukraine's defense. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=857.9000000000001s)]
*  So I think that's going to be something worth watching in these meetings coming up. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=860.9200000000001s)]
*  As you say, the 80th anniversary of D-Day kicks off a series of other meetings. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=865.9200000000001s)]
*  There's a big peace meeting in Switzerland in the middle of June. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=869.8800000000001s)]
*  The NATO summit is obviously a very big deal in the United States in July. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=872.92s)]
*  And it's all coming at a time where Russia is really ramped up its attacks on Ukraine, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=877.4799999999999s)]
*  lest we forget. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  There are daily reports of really intense Russian bombardments. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=883.56s)]
*  Ukraine seems to have held off a move on Kharkiv or near Kharkiv, but it's happening and it's [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=888.76s)]
*  unrelenting. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=895.68s)]
*  And so it's going to continue to be in the discussion, Carla. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=897.16s)]
*  Carla, I want to take us south of the border, that is south of the US border to Mexico. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=901.04s)]
*  This coming Sunday, June 2nd, Mexican voters will head to the polls to choose a new president, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=906.4s)]
*  all members of the legislature, that's 628, and as well as nine governors and about 20,000 [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=910.64s)]
*  local officials. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  I said at the outset, perhaps presumptuously, the next Mexican president is going to be [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  a woman because the top two candidates vying to be president are women and continue to [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=923.5600000000001s)]
*  hold strong poll positions, especially the lead poll at the moment. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=928.48s)]
*  But is this president going to be able to separate themselves, herself, from the current [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=932.24s)]
*  outgoing president known as AMLO? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=937.84s)]
*  This is quite the spectacle on all sorts of levels. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=940.6s)]
*  This is, as you said, a massive election and it's also been just a hugely violent political [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=942.6800000000001s)]
*  season in a country that's suffering as the cartels and their underlings battle for control [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=947.2s)]
*  of territory and political influence, particularly at the local level where you see so many people [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=953.0s)]
*  are up for election. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=957.84s)]
*  The New York Times found that 36 candidates have been killed this electoral season, which [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=959.6s)]
*  is really a chilling number and at least 28 of those were attributed to organized crime [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=963.52s)]
*  groups. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=968.12s)]
*  So whoever wins really has a lot on her plate. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=969.84s)]
*  What's most notable, of course, about Sunday's election is that a woman will almost certainly [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=973.52s)]
*  win the race. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=977.24s)]
*  The two leading candidates are both female. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=978.24s)]
*  And that's a really extraordinary thing in a country where women didn't win the right [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=980.7s)]
*  to vote until 1953 and where femicide is still really a massive, massive problem. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=983.92s)]
*  Another thing that she's going to have to face. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=990.4s)]
*  The hands down front runner is Claudia Schoenbaum. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=993.28s)]
*  She is a PhD environmental engineer, the former mayor of Mexico City, and she is the protege, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=996.4399999999999s)]
*  the chosen successor of the current president, Andrés Manuel Obrador AMLO. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1002.76s)]
*  The other major candidate is Societal Galvez. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1007.68s)]
*  She's a former conservative senator, a tech entrepreneur, also an engineer. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1011.4s)]
*  And she's heading up a coalition of parties brought together. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1015.72s)]
*  Really the only thing that they share is their opposition to AMLO. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1018.8s)]
*  The rise of these two women candidates can in good part be explained by Mexican law. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1022.84s)]
*  In 2002, they mandated that 30% of all congressional candidates had to be women. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1027.76s)]
*  That was then raised to 40%. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1032.72s)]
*  And in 2014, that quota was set at 50%. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1034.28s)]
*  And since 2018, Mexico's Congress has had a 50-50 gender split, and this is also spread [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1038.18s)]
*  out. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1043.46s)]
*  It's spread out to the number of governors and now these two candidates. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1044.46s)]
*  And this has been debated a lot. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1047.5s)]
*  Do quotas on corporate boards, do quotas on legislatures have an impact? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1049.1000000000001s)]
*  They apparently do. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1054.66s)]
*  And these are two quite strong candidates. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1055.88s)]
*  And here they are in what is a very macho country, suddenly with two women running for [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1058.14s)]
*  president, the two leaders. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1063.38s)]
*  While Shane Baum owes her political career to AMLO, he made her his environment secretary [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1065.46s)]
*  when he was mayor of Mexico City, she's really temperamentally very different personally [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1070.38s)]
*  from AMLO. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1075.3600000000001s)]
*  He's this charismatic populist. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1076.3600000000001s)]
*  She comes from the elite and is a far more reserved technocrat. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1079.18s)]
*  She's credited with reducing crime in Mexico City, although I think there are serious doubts [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1084.06s)]
*  about her claim that homicides drop by half. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1088.58s)]
*  While AMLO has been criticized for this increasing militarization of law enforcement, she invested [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1092.82s)]
*  in the city's civilian police force. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1099.5s)]
*  She's an environmental engineer. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1102.1s)]
*  She sort of promoted some public transportation, didn't do enough to maintain the metro, but [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1103.34s)]
*  she did a lot with solar panels and all of that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1108.4199999999998s)]
*  So she gets reasonably high marks for what she did in Mexico City. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1110.74s)]
*  But she's really been in lockstep with him in the campaign, including on this continued [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1115.26s)]
*  militarization of law enforcement. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1119.5s)]
*  The opposition has focused on that. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1121.64s)]
*  The opposition has also said it wants to do privatization, very much focused on allegations [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1123.92s)]
*  of corruption with AMLO, and been very concerned on his authoritarianism. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1128.2800000000002s)]
*  He really has gone after journalists. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1133.8000000000002s)]
*  He's gone after the electoral board. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1136.24s)]
*  He's gone after the courts. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1137.88s)]
*  I think it's going to be one of the big tests for her when she comes in, particularly whether [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1139.16s)]
*  she's going to stick to his call for constitutional reform, which would lead to Supreme Court [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1143.44s)]
*  justices being voted in. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1149.0400000000002s)]
*  And if that were to go forward, his Morena Party, her Morena Party could end up controlling [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1151.52s)]
*  all three branches of government. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1156.6s)]
*  So we will see. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1158.52s)]
*  Can she break away from AMLO? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1160.06s)]
*  Will she be more of a Democrat than he is? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1161.72s)]
*  She has been saying when those questions are raised, what do you think? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1165.06s)]
*  A woman can't stand on her own? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1168.72s)]
*  And he says he's going to retire to his ranch. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1171.08s)]
*  We'll see if he really does. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1174.0s)]
*  So another big election in the year of elections, certainly, but certainly for Americans, one [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1176.02s)]
*  that's right next door, and that is hugely consequential because of this issue of the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1181.62s)]
*  US-Mexican border and migrant flows. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1186.86s)]
*  Any sense at all, Carla, whether from her campaigning or any other signaling, whether [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1189.94s)]
*  there's going to be any kind of change in Mexico's policy involving migrants? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1195.42s)]
*  AMLO, for all his populism, seemed to have handled the issue fairly deftly, whether it [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1199.42s)]
*  was President Trump or President Biden. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1205.06s)]
*  I think AMLO has been quite cooperative by American standards on migration issues. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1206.86s)]
*  Certainly the numbers have been huge, but keeping migrants in Mexico, debate whether [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1213.1s)]
*  or not that's a safe place. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1218.54s)]
*  But he's been quite cooperative by American standards, committed to slowing things down. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1220.6599999999999s)]
*  More recently, he's been making pledges itself. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1225.62s)]
*  She says that people should be treated with dignity. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1228.3s)]
*  She said all the right things. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1230.56s)]
*  She's not committed to making a major change in that policy. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1232.5s)]
*  AMLO has been very resistant to cooperating on security issues, whether it's been the [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1235.8600000000001s)]
*  fentanyl issue, sharing intel on the cartels in Mexico. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1240.42s)]
*  He's insisted this is a sovereignty issue. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1243.9s)]
*  We'll see whether or not she's more cooperative on that front. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1246.6200000000001s)]
*  I think that's one thing that the US is going to be watching very closely. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1248.7s)]
*  It's very interesting also that she will be inheriting, I guess, a set of policies instead [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1251.82s)]
*  of growing trade ties between Mexico and the US because of the way global supply chains [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1256.14s)]
*  have really shifted in recent years and this kind of nearshoring issue that our colleague [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1262.02s)]
*  Shannon O'Neill has written about quite a bit where things that used to be made in China [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1266.74s)]
*  or expected to be made in China are being made in Mexico. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1270.78s)]
*  And the US has a renegotiated trade agreement with Mexico and Canada under the Trump administration [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1274.06s)]
*  that will be revisited again under the next presidency, whether it is a second Biden or [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1280.06s)]
*  a second Trump. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1285.1s)]
*  Any sense where she stands on those issues? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1286.46s)]
*  Or again, is it potentially kind of status quo? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1288.58s)]
*  Well, you know, the opposition would say and the opposition is very much a business opposition. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1291.18s)]
*  Certainly, the leader is a business opposition would say that this has been too much of a [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1296.1399999999999s)]
*  statist economy under AMLO. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1300.94s)]
*  She comes from the left. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1303.78s)]
*  We'll see whether or not they seize this opportunity. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1305.42s)]
*  The Economist magazine had a very sniffy piece about her right now of the wasted potential [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1307.46s)]
*  that has come and then hoping that she wouldn't waste more of this potential. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1313.18s)]
*  So we'll have to watch that space. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1317.68s)]
*  The Economist is sniffy. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1319.3s)]
*  I'm amazed. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1320.7s)]
*  Yes, it's only they can do it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1324.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1327.5800000000002s)]
*  Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1328.26s)]
*  This is a figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's Instagram [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1333.14s)]
*  story. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1338.5400000000002s)]
*  And this week, they selected what you predicted. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1339.7s)]
*  North Korea's second spy satellite explodes. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1342.9s)]
*  So who do they want to spy on? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1346.5800000000002s)]
*  And does this mean that their technology is better or worse than we thought? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1348.42s)]
*  Well, let me take the second one first, because the technology extends to floating balloons [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1355.5s)]
*  across the border filled with manure and batteries and such. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1361.14s)]
*  That was something that we saw happen over the last couple of days. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1364.78s)]
*  Not our border, though. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1367.5s)]
*  This is the border with South Korea. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1368.78s)]
*  And we should say South Korea has been known to send things over the border, promoting [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1370.74s)]
*  or provoking North Koreans about where they stand on a number of issues, but really sort [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1376.22s)]
*  of extolling freedom and democracy. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1380.66s)]
*  And the North Koreans resent that mightily and so responded in kind in their kind with [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1382.66s)]
*  this latest gesture. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1387.74s)]
*  But more seriously, most recently, they fired reportedly about 10 short range ballistic [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1389.0600000000002s)]
*  missiles off their East Coast. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1395.14s)]
*  And they flew about 200 miles. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1397.42s)]
*  South Korean military was watching this closely. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1400.18s)]
*  This is an ongoing set of tests involving ballistic missile capacity. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1402.38s)]
*  They have intercontinental ballistic missile capacity as well. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1406.42s)]
*  We'll be keeping an eye out for those tests. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1409.54s)]
*  We're going to be keeping an eye out for what's been called the seventh nuclear test to see [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1411.38s)]
*  what their nuclear capabilities are. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1415.94s)]
*  But the most recent issue that spurred our audience figure happened to be with a spy [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1417.6200000000001s)]
*  satellite. So they have successfully launched a spy satellite and they are keen to sort [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1422.26s)]
*  of harvest more information about military maneuvers on their own peninsula and in the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1427.46s)]
*  region as the U.S. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1432.3400000000001s)]
*  continues to bind itself more tightly with South Korea and Japan. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1433.94s)]
*  And importantly, South Korea and Japan are improving their relations because of the growing [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1436.82s)]
*  dangers in the neighborhood. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1442.3s)]
*  And this is all a backdrop to these messages that Kim has been sending out or has been [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1443.74s)]
*  ramping up, shall we say, since the beginning of the year about how North Korea sees South [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1448.42s)]
*  Korea. In January 10th, it declares South Korea to be an enemy state. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1453.58s)]
*  They ended talk about any sort of peaceful reunification and they consider their nuclear [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1457.26s)]
*  arsenal and their capacity to develop missiles as a key part of their sort of strategic [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1463.34s)]
*  profile going forward. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1469.86s)]
*  They are getting less and less pressure collectively from the UN Security Council. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1471.5s)]
*  Certainly Russia and China are not oppressing them in ways that they had in the past. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1476.34s)]
*  There was a panel that the UN had set up 15 years ago or so to review their activities [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1481.54s)]
*  related to sanctions. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1487.02s)]
*  And that panel was not renewed this spring because of a Russian veto, although the sanctions [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1488.46s)]
*  still remain in place. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1493.7s)]
*  Growing development has been the North Korean-Russian ties, especially in the military [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1495.46s)]
*  front. And that has been a factor of concern. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1499.7s)]
*  And that could also involve technology. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1502.62s)]
*  Russia's got loads of technology that could be very useful to North Korea. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1504.42s)]
*  North Korea has loads of armaments that are useful in the Russian campaign against Ukraine. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1507.9s)]
*  So all of this is to say that here's a reminder that North Korea likes to remind people [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1512.42s)]
*  that it's around and it could cause problems. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1518.18s)]
*  Our colleague, Suh Tae-ri, has a new piece in Foreign Affairs where she cites this and [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1520.7s)]
*  cites the fact that particularly in election years, US election years, North Korea likes [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1524.98s)]
*  to make its presence known. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1528.8200000000002s)]
*  There's actually data showing that in election years, there's a huge ramp up in North [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1531.1000000000001s)]
*  Korean activities and tests, military tests and so forth. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1535.26s)]
*  And we should continue to expect something like that in the run up to Election Day. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1538.46s)]
*  We should also note that there was a fascinating period of diplomacy involving former [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1543.26s)]
*  President Trump and Kim Jong-un. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1548.46s)]
*  There was a bromance and it was really a bromance for a while there. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1550.26s)]
*  They did not yield much of anything, although there were all sorts of historic meetings [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1553.8600000000001s)]
*  that took place. But Trump, at the end of the day, would not take the sanctions off the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1557.58s)]
*  table. And that ended that, although he's continued to reference on his current campaign [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1561.5s)]
*  stumps. To this day, the letters, the warm letters he received from Kim Jong-un. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1566.6599999999999s)]
*  Beautiful letters. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1571.26s)]
*  Beautiful letters. There is concern that based on the comments from some officials who [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1572.1799999999998s)]
*  are rumored to be in the national security circles of the Trump campaign, that they would [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1577.5s)]
*  be taking a tougher line towards South Korea in terms of any sort of umbrella help for [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1582.5s)]
*  South Korea vis-a-vis North Korea. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1587.1799999999998s)]
*  Trump related officials have mentioned South Korea needs to develop its own nuclear turn, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1589.02s)]
*  for example, in its own ability to defend itself. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1592.78s)]
*  So there's that kind of language coming out at the same time. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1595.6599999999999s)]
*  So all of which is to say, expect North Korea to be an item of concern, but also an [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1599.78s)]
*  item that should give pause to people who are considering the U.S. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1607.02s)]
*  policies in that part of the world. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1609.8999999999999s)]
*  It is a rogue state that is getting more and more capable militarily. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1611.8999999999999s)]
*  Getting roger. Getting roger, indeed. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKWFd-O9oL4&t=1616.58s)]
