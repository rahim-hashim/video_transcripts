# Eyes on Gaza, Argentina’s Presidential Vote, Putin Seeks Friends, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ)
*  In the coming week, the crisis in Gaza grows more dire, struggling Argentina votes for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a new president, and Russia continues its search for friendly nations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  It's October 19th, 2023, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=11.48s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=27.48s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=28.48s)]
*  Carla, let's start this week with what's ahead for Israel and Hamas, especially in Gaza. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=29.48s)]
*  The humanitarian situation has grown more grim there, with daily reports of the worsening [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=34.2s)]
*  situation and anticipation about a potential aid convoy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=39.42s)]
*  Just this week, President Biden landed in Tel Aviv for a day-long trip that was demonstrating [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=43.52s)]
*  his steadfast support for Israel, but contained some warnings as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Iran has also announced it will take a quote unquote preemptive measure against Israel [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=52.16s)]
*  to defend Gaza. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  Is this growing into a larger international conflict? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=57.76s)]
*  Well, Bob, that is one of the reasons why Biden went there, somewhat to my surprise. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  I don't know if you were surprised. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=65.72s)]
*  This is always going to be a tough trip. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=66.92s)]
*  He decided to accept Bibi Netanyahu's invitation, and he went there in part to warn Hezbollah [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=69.6s)]
*  and Iran and any other potential bad actors against getting into this fight. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=74.68s)]
*  It's the same reason the US has sent two aircraft carrier groups into the region and put some [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=78.96s)]
*  2,000 US troops on alert, while insisting that if deployed, there would only provide [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=82.8s)]
*  medical support or play an advisory role. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=87.44s)]
*  What we understand, the US has also been doing some behind-the-scenes diplomacy to warn Iran [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=90.6s)]
*  off sending messages via Qatar and others. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=94.96s)]
*  Clearly, everybody's nervous that this could get wider, and if it were to get wider, it [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=97.2s)]
*  probably would be start between Israel and Hezbollah and Lebanon. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=101.44s)]
*  But there's a lot of warnings going out there, and that's one of the reasons why Biden went. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=105.16s)]
*  This was always going to be a challenging visit for Biden, and it got a whole lot harder [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=109.5s)]
*  after the horrifying explosion on Tuesday at the Al-Ali hospital in Gaza, which killed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=113.06s)]
*  hundreds of men, women, and children, many of whom had gone there seeking shelter because [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=117.28s)]
*  they thought a hospital was going to be safe. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=121.44s)]
*  At least part of Biden's day yesterday was devoted to this question of who was responsible. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=124.12s)]
*  As of now, and keep in mind that intelligence is preliminary, but US intelligence relying [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=128.68s)]
*  on infrared satellite data and open source video, they were supporting Israel's claim [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=133.64s)]
*  that a rocket or missile launched from Gaza, and the Israelis are blaming the Palestinian [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=137.76s)]
*  Islamic Jihad had misfired and exploded over the hospital. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=142.32s)]
*  But even if that's confirmed, it's unlikely to change anybody's mind in the region. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=146.04s)]
*  And so Biden flew into a really, really tough situation, obviously a horrible situation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  on the ground and a very tough situation diplomatically. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=155.34s)]
*  In addition to waving off Iran, Biden went to provide moral support for Israel after [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  the brutal massacres on October 7th, but he was also underlining the need for restraint [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=162.84s)]
*  as the Israelis are committed to destroying Hamas, and we're still waiting to see how [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=167.48s)]
*  they plan on doing it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=171.72s)]
*  We've been waiting to see, is there a ground invasion coming? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=173.44s)]
*  Washington has been pressing the Israelis to delay that, to allow as many Gazans as [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=176.96s)]
*  possible to flee southwards. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=180.72s)]
*  On 60 Minutes on Sunday, Biden warned that occupying Gaza would be a big mistake. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=182.6s)]
*  And when he was there, he was pressing for restraint, you know, in a not so oblique reference [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=187.44s)]
*  to the mistakes the United States made after 9-11. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=191.84s)]
*  In a speech on Biden warned the Israelis, what he said was, why you feel that rage, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  don't be consumed by it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=198.44s)]
*  So it was a really interesting mixture of I stand really with you, I understand your [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  rage, I understand your pain, but be careful here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  And it was a tough message, and I think he did a reasonably good job, but what we don't [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=208.64s)]
*  know is are the Israelis listening? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=212.72s)]
*  Biden also pledged $100 million in aid to Gaza and the West Bank during the trip. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=215.6s)]
*  And by the time he left, he said he'd gotten a commitment from both the Egyptians, he spent [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=219.6s)]
*  30 minutes on the phone with Egypt's president, and from the Israelis that they could finally [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=223.48s)]
*  allow these 20 trucks that are waiting there, of course, there's like 160 that are ready [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=228.02s)]
*  to go into Gaza if this deal holds. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=232.38s)]
*  Now as of Thursday, there was no sign that that border was going to be open. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=235.78s)]
*  We understand that the road has to be repaired and that UN officials have to get some sort [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  of system in place because the Israelis are insisting that this aid can't go to Hamas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=244.18s)]
*  Lord knows how they could possibly do it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=247.82s)]
*  But if they begin to let aid in, it's not going to, certainly 20 trucks aren't going [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=250.34s)]
*  to solve any problem here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=255.5s)]
*  There's more than a million people on the move, but a little bit of progress. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=256.94s)]
*  And if he counsels restraint, I don't know what the Israelis end game is here, but that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=261.74s)]
*  was what Biden tried to do. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=265.3s)]
*  And overall, at least on that front, we see a little bit of progress if that border opens [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=266.58s)]
*  and gets some aid in. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=271.86s)]
*  Yes, Carla. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=273.1s)]
*  And we should note again, whenever we tape these podcasts with fluid stories, things [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=274.1s)]
*  could change. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=278.74s)]
*  Maybe the aid starts moving through, maybe it gets held up for further days. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=280.0s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=283.86s)]
*  We have the president scheduled to make a speech right around the time our podcast drops [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=284.86s)]
*  to the country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  He's supposed to talk about, I think, both Israel and Ukraine in terms of getting aid [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  to both sides. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=293.38s)]
*  And he may or may not be speaking at a time when there is some sort of a resolution to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=294.82s)]
*  the infighting of the Republican Party over a House speaker, which has been an unprecedented [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  situation in its own right and is really crimping the US ability to kind of speak with any sort [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=303.72s)]
*  of really strong voice. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=308.86s)]
*  And the US credibility, back to your original point about the hospital bombing, regardless [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=311.98s)]
*  of what even very credible investigations find, it's just the US and the Israelis have [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=316.5s)]
*  a tough position to hold vis-a-vis the so-called Arab street. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  And public opinion is really running hot right now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  And it's really a dangerous moment, not just the international aspect of a broadening conflict, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=331.82s)]
*  but also just societally what is going on between Muslims and Jews right now. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=337.12s)]
*  It's a really difficult time. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=340.82s)]
*  It's an incredibly difficult time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=342.14s)]
*  One of the things that Biden had hoped to do on this trip is he'd hoped to go to Jordan [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=344.08s)]
*  after Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=347.58s)]
*  And we're supposed to meet with our closest allies in the region, with King Abdullah of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=348.9s)]
*  Jordan, with calling Egypt a close ally, but Egypt is traditionally a close ally, as well [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=352.98s)]
*  as Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  And I assume to make the clear point that the US really is committed to reviving some [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  peace talks to create a Palestinian state. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=368.26s)]
*  But after this hospital explosion and with the street protests spreading across the region, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  King Abdullah canceled that meeting. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=376.05999999999995s)]
*  And the Jordanians have blamed the Israelis for this explosion. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  So incredibly hard to orchestrate anything in the midst of a war, very hard to do diplomacy [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  in the midst of it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=387.53999999999996s)]
*  And then Biden, as you said, comes home and is going to give this speech tonight. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=388.94s)]
*  And what we're hearing is he's going to ask for $100 billion for aid. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=391.78s)]
*  He's tying Israeli aid to aid for Ukraine in hopes of overcoming this growing isolationist [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=395.26s)]
*  wing in the Republican Party. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=401.26s)]
*  And in the midst, of course, of the speaker fight in the House, see whether or not they [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=403.62s)]
*  get past that and the ability to do this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=407.14s)]
*  And he's also looking at beginning of divisions within his own political party, perhaps overplayed [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=409.86s)]
*  in this. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=414.34s)]
*  I think it's a very small number of Democrats who are criticizing Israel in this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=415.34s)]
*  But keeping the political party together for the Democrats as well is going to be a challenge [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=419.46s)]
*  in pushing this forward. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=423.4s)]
*  We'll see whether he gets the Ukraine aid tied to the Israel aid. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=424.4s)]
*  So he has a lot to sell here. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=427.23999999999995s)]
*  So I'm not going to make the analogy between what's going on in Israel and what's going [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=429.2s)]
*  on there, but it's going to take a lot of diplomacy at home as well. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=432.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=435.76s)]
*  And I would note for listeners to continue to look for the strong sources on this, credible [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=436.76s)]
*  sources on this story. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  And social media is not a good place to be hunting around for information. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  In our own think tank, Stephen Cook, I would commend people to read what he's been writing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=446.96s)]
*  on this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=450.32s)]
*  He's been writing this week on our website on the Egyptian perspective on all this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=451.32s)]
*  He's also been writing for Foreign Policy about why Qatar has become a place for Hamas [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=454.8s)]
*  leaders to be based. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=459.0s)]
*  We have a piece up about the humanitarian struggles facing Gaza, as well as a piece [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=460.88s)]
*  just going live from our colleague David Sheffer about what are the laws of war and what do [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=466.32s)]
*  they say about how this type of campaign is conducted. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=470.64s)]
*  Let's not forget, there are also close to 200 hostages that Hamas is holding. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=473.28s)]
*  We don't know how that whole scenario is going to play out. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=477.08s)]
*  What is going to be discussed and what way it figures into any sort of, whether it's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=479.58s)]
*  a ceasefire or any sort of calming of the situation, we fear it's going to get worse [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=483.62s)]
*  before it gets better. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  And one other thing to keep in mind, Americans in harm's way, we're not exactly sure how [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=488.85999999999996s)]
*  many Americans are among those hostages. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=492.86s)]
*  We're hearing about five plus. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=494.53999999999996s)]
*  And across the region, the State Department is calling for people to pull out of Lebanon, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=497.14s)]
*  warning in Bahrain, which is one of the countries that established relations with Israel. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=503.41999999999996s)]
*  There's been protests. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=507.46s)]
*  They had to close a consulate in Adana, Turkey. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=509.9s)]
*  It's a very fraught time across the region. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=512.34s)]
*  So we hope that people are safe and our hearts are going out to both Israelis and the people [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=514.78s)]
*  in Gaza, but it's a very fraught time. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=519.62s)]
*  So Carla, before we move on to other topics, I want to give a quick update on some additional [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=521.9399999999999s)]
*  topics we discussed last week because there were some upcoming votes. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=525.6999999999999s)]
*  One of them was Australia's referendum to create an indigenous voice, which was rejected [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=528.8199999999999s)]
*  by Australian voters. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=533.06s)]
*  I'm sure we'll be discussing related issues again in future podcasts. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=534.66s)]
*  I would like to clarify my original comments and point out that a yes vote would have enshrined [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=538.02s)]
*  in the constitution a way for indigenous people to advise parliament on policies that affect [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=541.8599999999999s)]
*  their lives, but would not have mandated representation in parliament. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=546.66s)]
*  Our thanks to a listener for suggesting the clarification. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=550.78s)]
*  Also Poland had elections that produced a likely victory for opposition forces, although [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=553.6199999999999s)]
*  the ruling law and justice party did come first in overall vote share. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=557.9799999999999s)]
*  It looks unlikely that it has enough seats to form a government. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=563.28s)]
*  The civic coalition, KO, plans to form a coalition with the center-right third-way party, which [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=566.4s)]
*  means it will have the necessary majority to govern Poland. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=570.8399999999999s)]
*  And now the country seems to be on track to return to a more pro-EU, pro-Ukraine set of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  policies. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=579.8399999999999s)]
*  So progress there, perhaps. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=580.8399999999999s)]
*  Possible. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=582.92s)]
*  So Bob, on to another election. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=583.92s)]
*  This Sunday, Argentina is going to hold its presidential and congressional vote. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=585.8s)]
*  Argentina has a history of hyperinflation and strongmen promising to fix their economy [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=590.44s)]
*  and every other ill. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=594.8800000000001s)]
*  A lot of magical thinking in Argentina's history. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=596.36s)]
*  It's in particularly bad shape right now with an annual inflation rate currently at 138 [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=599.72s)]
*  percent and the central bank is predicting it's going to reach 180 percent year end [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=604.24s)]
*  and knowing Argentina's history would probably be higher than that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  So what are you watching for in this vote? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=611.48s)]
*  Well you know, we've often heard the phrase in this country, it's the economy, stupid. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  Let's put it all in caps and bold and however else you can really highlight it because that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=618.4s)]
*  really seems to be what this is about. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=622.38s)]
*  I mean Argentina has sort of otherworldly economic problems and they're really coming [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=623.92s)]
*  to the fore in this. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=628.72s)]
*  And as you say, the inflation and its debt problems are in the front order. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=630.4s)]
*  We should cite a few other things. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=634.36s)]
*  Forty percent of Argentinians live at the poverty level basically. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=635.6s)]
*  The country's had a real struggle in paying back international creditors. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=639.3199999999999s)]
*  It's had three defaults since 2000 I believe. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  It's currently involved in IMF loans for 44 billion dollars. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=645.3s)]
*  Just recently IMF unlocked 7.5 billion of that figure a little bit earlier than planned. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=649.66s)]
*  But it's a really tricky time period at a time when there is a very competitive election [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=655.02s)]
*  playing out. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=659.38s)]
*  We have to lead off with the figure of Javier Millet who is a former economist, 52 years [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=660.4599999999999s)]
*  old, who is a validly libertarian and he represents the Liberty Advances Party. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=665.62s)]
*  And he has come out with a very strong platform where the shaking up the economy and shaking [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=671.86s)]
*  up the way of doing business is front and center, starting off with proposals to dollarize [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=677.1s)]
*  the economy. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=681.9s)]
*  Part of that would be achieved presumably by his plan to eliminate the central bank. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=683.3000000000001s)]
*  He wants to cut public spending by 15 percent. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=687.14s)]
*  He's also among other things been critical of the pope who's a fellow Argentinian because [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=690.26s)]
*  he quote, always stands on the side of evil, end quote, because he supports taxes. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=695.74s)]
*  I think a lot of people in the United States would probably agree with that, not about [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=700.2199999999999s)]
*  the pope but about taxes. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=703.5799999999999s)]
*  About taxes. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=705.06s)]
*  People get very strong and hold almost religious feelings about taxes, that's true. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=706.06s)]
*  But as it pertains the Argentinian currency, the peso, he is referred to it many ways including [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=710.4599999999999s)]
*  as quote, unquote, excrement. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=715.38s)]
*  And some say his comments talking down the peso and talking up the dollar could have [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=718.2199999999999s)]
*  been responsible for it losing further value just since he emerged as a leading figure [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=722.86s)]
*  in the August primaries. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=726.8199999999999s)]
*  It's going to be closely watched. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=728.82s)]
*  He seems to have galvanized certainly some younger voters and social media. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  He seems to have a good deal of ferment and interest. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=733.9000000000001s)]
*  But also polling decently are sort of an establishment figure, Sergio Massa, who's the current economy [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=737.4200000000001s)]
*  minister. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=742.5400000000001s)]
*  Now you might think that's a suicide mission for a sitting economy minister to run for [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=743.5400000000001s)]
*  president given the country's economic status. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=747.6600000000001s)]
*  But he's trying to show he's a unity figure and he represents the Peronist Union for the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=750.5400000000001s)]
*  homeland party. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=755.34s)]
*  And he's already made a number of gestures including eliminating income taxes for almost [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=757.14s)]
*  everybody. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=761.02s)]
*  He's cut taxes on groceries for a huge number of people. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=762.02s)]
*  He's given cash bonuses to various groups like retirees and waived export taxes on things [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=764.74s)]
*  like agricultural products. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=769.86s)]
*  Now agriculture is a really important sector in Argentina. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=771.1800000000001s)]
*  It is a country known for its beef, its wine, its grain and so forth. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=773.58s)]
*  But in making such deals, he's also put the country in further tough straits in terms [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=779.44s)]
*  of trying to deal with its IMF obligations. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=785.14s)]
*  As our colleagues Shannon O'Neill and Will Freeman wrote in recent CFR blog, basically [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=788.74s)]
*  what happened at the end of the summer was Argentina conducted a complicated shell game [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=793.86s)]
*  to pay off a $1.8 billion debt with loans from Qatar and then Development Bank of Latin [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=797.98s)]
*  America and a $1.7 billion swap with the Chinese to cover payments. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=802.62s)]
*  So there's a lot of things moving around here. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=807.62s)]
*  Whoever wins, and it looks like a runoff in November is going to be likely given some [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=810.3s)]
*  of the polling figures so far. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=814.68s)]
*  Whoever gets that distinction is going to be facing a steep hill. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=816.64s)]
*  But Argentina, while it's gone through wave after wave of economic travails, has shown [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=819.76s)]
*  a pretty vibrant democracy. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=825.3599999999999s)]
*  So it's going to be extremely interesting, Carla, in this season of interesting elections. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=826.8399999999999s)]
*  So one of the things about Argentina, and I actually used to work in Argentina, is that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=832.4799999999999s)]
*  in recent years it's really moved the region ahead in gender equality and LGBTQ plus rights. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=838.0s)]
*  They had this, I think it was the Green Wave Movement for abortion rights. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=844.68s)]
*  And it was the first country in Latin America to have a gender quota law in 1991 to legalize [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=849.0799999999999s)]
*  same sex marriage in 2010. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=854.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't think this, the front runner is pretty progressive on this front. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=857.3199999999999s)]
*  What's going to happen with that if he wins? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=862.56s)]
*  Yeah, some of the language we're hearing from him on these issues is reminiscent of [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=864.92s)]
*  Jair Bolsonaro nearby Brazil. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  In terms of his strong anti-abortion positions and strong social conservative positions that [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=872.44s)]
*  run counter to that grain that you just mentioned of progressive policies on those fronts. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=877.76s)]
*  And so yeah, and he speaks pretty bluntly on these matters. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  He doesn't sort of sugarcoat things. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=886.32s)]
*  And Jair Bolsonaro also was pretty blunt on this front. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=887.92s)]
*  And in Bolsonaro's case, it served him well in part because he was capable of portraying [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=891.28s)]
*  himself as this anti-establishment figure at a time. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=895.64s)]
*  In Bolsonaro's case, Brazil was reeling from corruption problems. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=898.62s)]
*  Now the Peronist dominated governments have had their own corruption issues. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=901.88s)]
*  Real problems with the IMF have also made people just exasperated about their own capabilities [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=907.08s)]
*  and their ability to kind of work their way out of these straight jackets that they say [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=913.64s)]
*  are just keeping the country down and making more and more people try to hold their assets [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  and dollars and so forth. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=922.9s)]
*  And so here comes Millay saying, let's just dollarize it all and let's get rid of this [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=924.4399999999999s)]
*  central bank, downsize the government, turn more conservative. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=928.72s)]
*  In ways that appeal to some people in the country. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=931.8s)]
*  It's not clear though that he has the staying power to make, let's say the social conservative [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=934.9599999999999s)]
*  policies stick. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=938.76s)]
*  Also for him to be able to do any sort of major steps on reform, certainly on changing [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=940.3599999999999s)]
*  the currency, he's going to have to build coalitions. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=945.04s)]
*  He doesn't seem to have, according to polling, the legislative strength to bring these things [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=947.76s)]
*  through. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=951.4s)]
*  And so I'm not sure he's the kind of bridge builder that's going to be needed for Argentina [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=952.4s)]
*  to do the things that he wants to do. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  So again, that's why I say I think we're looking at a runoff that would involve either [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=957.6s)]
*  him and Massa or another candidate, Patricia Bullrich, who's a former security minister [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=961.8000000000001s)]
*  from a center right party, United for Change, which has been polling decently. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=966.88s)]
*  She's also sort of a low tax exponent, but her focus has been on crime and fighting crime. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=971.12s)]
*  So maybe he finds common cause with her or maybe Massa is able to galvanize enough support [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=977.6s)]
*  to move ahead. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=982.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not clear what the country is feeling like right now. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=983.36s)]
*  Other than that, which has been a refrain in our discussions, Carla, there's divisions [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=987.12s)]
*  in countries around the world at this time. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=990.42s)]
*  And this is another election where you could really see a divide in Argentina in public. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=992.88s)]
*  But I do think leading everything is a sentiment of just absolute frustration about their economic [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=996.36s)]
*  problems. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1001.44s)]
*  I'm always amazed that the IMF keeps lending to them. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1002.44s)]
*  I think they find Argentina a tantalizing country. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1005.04s)]
*  I mean, it remains the third largest economy in Latin America. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1007.48s)]
*  It's also one of the, you know, who owns who. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1010.36s)]
*  They're in so deep to Argentina, they can't help themselves. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1013.76s)]
*  Well, Carla, let's shift the conversation to Russia. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1016.8399999999999s)]
*  This week, President Vladimir Putin actually went on the road. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1020.4s)]
*  He met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and attended the Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1023.6s)]
*  That marked the 10 years of the Belt and Road Initiative. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1028.24s)]
*  His foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, is wrapping up a visit to North Korea. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1031.7s)]
*  And these high level, high profile engagements seem to be drawing a lot of attention, partly [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1036.28s)]
*  because Putin has rarely been seen outside of Russia because of his ICC indictment related [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1041.28s)]
*  to war crimes in Ukraine. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1046.48s)]
*  So what's behind this Russian move towards a diplomatic ramp up? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1048.8400000000001s)]
*  So as you noted, Bob, Putin has been pretty much homebound since the ICC issued a warrant [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1054.04s)]
*  for his arrest in March. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1058.76s)]
*  He missed the BRIC Summit. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1060.26s)]
*  We talked about that in South Africa and the G20 Summit in India. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1061.56s)]
*  But last week, Mr. Putin did venture out. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1066.04s)]
*  He went to Kyrgyzstan for a summit of former Soviet states, and now he's gone to China. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1067.92s)]
*  I think probably the simplest explanation for what's going on here is that he needs [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1071.96s)]
*  to take his friends wherever he can find them. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1075.72s)]
*  And he doesn't have a lot of them. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1077.5600000000002s)]
*  There were representatives of some 140 states at the BRIC Summit. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1079.3200000000002s)]
*  And other than a few Europeans, I gather former French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Refrain [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1083.8000000000002s)]
*  appears to be the most notable who walked out. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1088.76s)]
*  Pretty much everybody seemed pretty nice to him, which is pretty shameful when you think [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1091.64s)]
*  about the fact that this guy has a warrant with the ICC. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1095.56s)]
*  Even Viktor Orban was there. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1099.04s)]
*  And greeting his old friend Vlad, Putin has been especially eager to get his so-called [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1100.6s)]
*  no limits partnership with China, which has been chilled by the Ukraine war, back on track. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1106.4199999999998s)]
*  And the Chinese, they were very strongly warned off by the US and others, haven't become a [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1111.76s)]
*  major weapon supplier to Russia during this war. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1116.12s)]
*  But there has been some leakage, as they say delicately. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1118.96s)]
*  He's really been a very helpful source of cash and goods for Russia. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1122.88s)]
*  A third of more Russian oil exports are sold to China. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1126.76s)]
*  And overall trade between the countries is up really significantly. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1130.4s)]
*  So he has a lot of reasons why he wants to be cultivating Xi. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1133.98s)]
*  The Chinese are more ambivalent about Russia. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1137.68s)]
*  I think Xi was pretty furious about Ukraine. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1139.48s)]
*  If they had a visit from Putin and then Putin didn't tell him what was going to happen, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1142.1200000000001s)]
*  I think he saw this as really reckless. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1146.08s)]
*  Xi likes being in the power seat, however, and rather than being patronized by their [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1149.04s)]
*  once senior partners, the Russians, and this really does put him in the power seat. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1153.44s)]
*  And he certainly has benefited greatly from the Western cap on Russian oil prices. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1157.08s)]
*  They love the bargain. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1161.44s)]
*  And I read in the Times a really interesting fact, one out of every two cars sold in Russia [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1162.98s)]
*  today comes from China. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1167.12s)]
*  And China had absolutely no market share before this. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1168.76s)]
*  So China is benefiting economically from this. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1170.96s)]
*  But at the same time, Xi is pretty ambivalent about Putin. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1174.36s)]
*  He wants to be accepted in all of Xi, that is, wants to be accepted in all of the best [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1177.08s)]
*  capitals. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1181.04s)]
*  So an overly tight embrace of Putin wouldn't be good for him. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1182.04s)]
*  This week, the two of them were the best of buds. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1185.6399999999999s)]
*  They were doing the champion of the Global South routine at the BRI, talking about sanctions [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1188.08s)]
*  and about how the West was so exclusionary and how they would never do that. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1193.1999999999998s)]
*  And they had pretty much the same rap when they were up on stage for this. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1197.6s)]
*  I found Putin's statement particularly... [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1200.52s)]
*  He said, talked about how economic progress that respects, quote, civilizational diversity [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1203.48s)]
*  and the right of each country to its own model of development is what he was committed to. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1208.04s)]
*  And for the man who is destroying Ukraine, that's pretty rich. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1213.52s)]
*  So that was his thing, looking for friends and unfortunately, probably finding them in [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1218.3s)]
*  this meeting. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1223.6s)]
*  As for Lavrov, going to North Korea, that's the same thing. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1224.6s)]
*  Looking for friends in all the wrong places. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1228.24s)]
*  The North Koreans probably have at least as many or more sanctions on them and they've [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1230.64s)]
*  been cultivating the Russians. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1235.1200000000001s)]
*  The Russians have been cultivating them. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1236.6000000000001s)]
*  The North Koreans want technology from Moscow. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1237.92s)]
*  We've talked about that. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1239.92s)]
*  And Moscow wants munitions from North Korea. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1241.44s)]
*  The Russian defense minister went to North Korea in July. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1244.0800000000002s)]
*  We saw pictures of him being escorted by Kim through a weapons expo. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1246.5600000000002s)]
*  We know that Kim met with Putin. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1251.14s)]
*  This has been going on for a while. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1253.2s)]
*  And so I think this is going ahead and apparently bearing fruit because the White House last [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1254.6000000000001s)]
*  week said that they had pictures that they shared of North Korea was sending what they [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1258.4s)]
*  said were more than a thousand containers of military equipment and ammunition to Russia [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1263.92s)]
*  for use in Ukraine. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1267.72s)]
*  Of course, we don't know what was inside those containers, but that's what they say. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1268.72s)]
*  But there are also independent researchers who have released satellite photos showing [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1272.44s)]
*  rail and shipping traffic between North Korea and Russia's up. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1275.7s)]
*  And what does Russia need and what does North Korea have? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1278.76s)]
*  And North Korea is not going to be sending them iPhones. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1280.72s)]
*  They're probably sending them munitions. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1282.8000000000002s)]
*  And this is occurring during a week when it was reported that on the Ukraine battlefront, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1284.6000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine was able to use some of its longer range capabilities provided by the United [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1288.96s)]
*  States in particular to hit into Russia in ways that Putin shrugged off that defense [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1293.0s)]
*  analysts say are significant and bear watching. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1298.64s)]
*  So that war grinds on. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1301.32s)]
*  It got a little bit sidelined, obviously, because of the gravity of what's happening [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1303.52s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1307.6000000000001s)]
*  But you're right to pay attention to what Russia's got going on because they are trying [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1308.6000000000001s)]
*  to stick to their mission, which is basically to completely eliminate Ukraine as an independent [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1311.6s)]
*  state. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1317.4399999999998s)]
*  One thing that Putin and Xi have in common is that they are very much interested in cultivating [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1318.4399999999998s)]
*  the global south and very much interested in cultivating the well producing states. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1323.6799999999998s)]
*  So they have taken their positions on this conflict. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1327.32s)]
*  Tougher for Russia, which has been cultivating Israel and Israel's been cultivating Russia [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1331.36s)]
*  for a long time, but very forceful on the, you know, that we're not the United States. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1334.8s)]
*  We don't believe in sanctions, you know, let's sit on the fence, if anything, on lots of [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1340.04s)]
*  these other conflicts. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1344.0s)]
*  And it appeared a time in which we are in this situation, which we're trying to find [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1345.32s)]
*  a way for restraint in Gaza and which we're trying to support Ukraine. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1349.68s)]
*  And then you see a celebration in Beijing with Putin on that stage. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1353.24s)]
*  One can get pretty discouraged about that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1358.04s)]
*  But in the end of the day, we have to shrug and hope that the Ukrainians will push forward [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1360.0s)]
*  and the US Congress will do the right thing. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1365.48s)]
*  Now one upcoming international gathering that Putin will definitely not be at, and [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1367.44s)]
*  she will be by all appearances, is the APEC summit in San Francisco. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1372.28s)]
*  So that is coming around the corner. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1376.0s)]
*  We'll be talking about that in a few weeks. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1378.96s)]
*  So Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1380.8s)]
*  This is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1385.44s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1389.92s)]
*  And this week, Bob, our audience selected 9,000 killed by conflict in Sudan. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1391.28s)]
*  How has this reached such an incredibly high number? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1397.8000000000002s)]
*  In part because of all the things we've been talking about elsewhere in this podcast, Carla, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1402.48s)]
*  that have been taking up time and attention of some international actors that could potentially [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1407.16s)]
*  be trying to bring an end to this in terms of, you know, forging ahead with diplomacy [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1413.3600000000001s)]
*  between two main forces here, which is Sudan's military and the RSF paramilitary. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1417.92s)]
*  What's also happened, and it's equally disturbing, is that this has spread far beyond Khartoum, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1423.6000000000001s)]
*  where it was the principal focus of fighting initially. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1428.76s)]
*  And I think a lot of people recall that, you know, seeing bombs being dropped over the [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1431.5600000000002s)]
*  city and people were sharing footage of it and everything. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1436.04s)]
*  Well now it's spread quite a bit, including really distressingly to Darfur, which has [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1438.52s)]
*  seen one genocide this century and could be seeing another one. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1443.72s)]
*  I would note there was a recent report that was also captured on a podcast by The Economist, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1447.76s)]
*  which involving interviews with a number of people who have fled, Darfuris who have fled [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1452.68s)]
*  to Chad, neighboring Chad, and talking about what they were subjected to. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1457.12s)]
*  And it's just really difficult to listen to. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1461.84s)]
*  The 9,000 figure is in addition to four and a half million people now internally displaced, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1465.32s)]
*  1.2 million as refugees in countries like Chad. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1471.0s)]
*  Something like 25 million or so people or more than half of the country's population [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1475.52s)]
*  needing some sort of humanitarian aid. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1479.56s)]
*  And it's at a time when the humanitarian agencies are stretched and are saturated with appeals. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1481.8s)]
*  We just talked about Afghanistan's devastating earthquake, which killed more than 2,000 people [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1487.28s)]
*  in a country that was already on its heels. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1492.9199999999998s)]
*  We're talking about climate-driven famine and other conflicts that have caused migration [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1495.26s)]
*  to surge across the Mediterranean, to surge across the US southern border, and in other [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1500.28s)]
*  places. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1504.6s)]
*  So it is just coming at a very difficult time to muster some sort of action. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1505.6s)]
*  But sometimes when you cite round figures like 9,000, it does focus attention more and [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1510.54s)]
*  maybe we could get some more ramp up of diplomacy, Carla, but it's not clear whether this thing [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1516.4399999999998s)]
*  can be ended anytime soon. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1521.8799999999999s)]
*  So I'm glad you mentioned the diplomacy because remember when we talked about this quite a [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1523.8s)]
*  while ago, the US and Saudi Arabia were involved in trying to negotiate ceasefires. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1528.12s)]
*  Did they just give up? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1533.32s)]
*  I think they got sidelined by other things. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1534.48s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1537.2s)]
*  It's not that it was an easy round of diplomacy, but they were steadily trying to press the [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1538.2s)]
*  parties into creating ceasefire and then some sort of ground for resolution. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1542.62s)]
*  I think the problem is it gets more and more complicated as it spreads around the country [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1547.72s)]
*  and then you start to get into these genocidal areas where you have this recurrence of what [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1550.9199999999998s)]
*  we had seen in Darfur with the Arab Sudanese militias against black African ethnic groups [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1555.32s)]
*  and it becoming genocidal and that makes it even more challenging, but also more imperative [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1562.5600000000002s)]
*  that there be some kind of international intervention. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1566.72s)]
*  We should also note, as we also have discussed, it is sometimes beyond individual nation state [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1569.3400000000001s)]
*  brokers, the UN Security Council can kind of step in. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1573.88s)]
*  Security Council has shown again and again in recent years with this Chinese Russian block [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1577.0400000000002s)]
*  ever more firm and sort of what they will allow and won't allow, that you're not seeing [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1582.38s)]
*  effective action out of the UN Security Council and on top of it all, they're meeting in urgent [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1586.9s)]
*  session to deal with places like Gaza and so forth. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1591.84s)]
*  So I think it's a bit of fatigue. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1594.6s)]
*  I think it's a bit of distraction and again, we would hope that there would be an opportunity [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  to sort of step back in, get the parties to the table and start to set in motion something, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1601.6399999999999s)]
*  but it's going to need to involve I think peacekeeping and that's another area that's [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1606.78s)]
*  been really stretched. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1610.0s)]
*  Well that's our look at another turbulent world next week. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1612.0s)]
*  Here are some stories to keep an eye on. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1615.4399999999998s)]
*  President Biden will be hosting in the week ahead. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1616.9599999999998s)]
*  He's going to host top EU officials and then Australian Prime Minister Albanese for an [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1619.08s)]
*  official visit and state dinner. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1623.56s)]
*  Oh, are we going to get an invitation? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1625.04s)]
*  I'm looking out for it Carla. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1626.52s)]
*  Also next week, Saudi investment conference referred to as Davos in the desert takes place [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1628.3999999999999s)]
*  in Riyadh. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1633.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't want an invitation. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1634.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm just going to stop right there. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtPhAZ8wSQ&t=1635.4399999999998s)]
