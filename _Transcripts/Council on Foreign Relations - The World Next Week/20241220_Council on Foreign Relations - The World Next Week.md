# The World Next Year Wars, New Governments, and Stormy Weather to Watch in 2025
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc)
*  Welcome to the World Next Week's special year-end episode, The World Next Year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=4.4s)]
*  And I'm Carla Anne Robbins. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=6.08s)]
*  Joining us for this special episode is Stephen Erlanger, the chief diplomatic correspondent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=19.52s)]
*  in Europe for the New York Times. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=24.32s)]
*  Steve has reported from more than 120 countries and has been bureau chief. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=26.6s)]
*  I have to take a breath before I go through this list. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=30.76s)]
*  London, Bangkok, Moscow, Paris, Jerusalem, Berlin, Brussels, Prague, and Belgrade, as [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=33.72s)]
*  well as serving as the Times chief diplomatic correspondent in Washington. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  He's also a really dear friend, a long-time colleague, and we've logged quite a few [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=45.0s)]
*  miles together over the years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=49.6s)]
*  Steve, thanks so much for doing this and welcome to the World Next Week. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=51.2s)]
*  Thanks Carla and Bob. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=55.72s)]
*  It's a pleasure. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=56.72s)]
*  Well, Carla and Steve, 2024, which is quickly waning as we know is the year of elections, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=57.72s)]
*  something like 80 or so elections took place this year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=64.84s)]
*  And that includes the US presidential election, of course. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=69.0s)]
*  And so in this special episode, we are going to discuss what has happened in this momentous [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=71.4s)]
*  year, as well as chew over the big issues for 2025. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=75.04s)]
*  Steve, let's start with what you think are going to be the big stories in the coming [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=78.84s)]
*  year. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=83.4s)]
*  I'm in the Middle East. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=84.4s)]
*  You emailed me from the Abu Dhabi airport. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=85.4s)]
*  That's probably the coolest place someone emailed me from this year. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=88.0s)]
*  Although I've been in the Abu Dhabi airport, it's probably actually not that cool. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=91.36s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=95.0s)]
*  It's air-conditioned. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=96.0s)]
*  That's good. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=97.0s)]
*  So why don't we start there? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=98.0s)]
*  I don't mean in Abu Dhabi. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=101.0s)]
*  Let's start in the Middle East. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=102.76s)]
*  In the last few months, the Israelis have seen some of their strongest rivals and enemies, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=103.76s)]
*  Hezbollah, Hamas, Assad, Iran, if not vanquished, certainly weakened. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=108.0s)]
*  Is this the beginning of a new order in the region or is it only a temporary lull? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=113.08s)]
*  And is there any sign that Netanyahu will take the wins or start negotiating peace deals? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=117.28s)]
*  Well, I think I've written this before. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=122.32s)]
*  But October 7th, when Hamas went and invaded Israel, was like the fall of the wall in 1989. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=126.46s)]
*  It was completely unexpected. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=133.94s)]
*  And the ripples have continued in far beyond Gaza. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=136.4s)]
*  There's been an awful lot of death. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=141.24s)]
*  There's been an awful lot of tragedy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=143.52s)]
*  But there is a new order in the Middle East and we'll see how long it lasts and whether [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=145.94s)]
*  Israel, as your question suggests, goes too far, which is always a temptation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=151.28s)]
*  The Saudis, the Gulfis are happy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=158.44s)]
*  Russia's weakened. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  Turkey's strengthened, which annoys the Sunnis no end because Erdogan is actually light political [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  Islam close to Hamas and to the Muslim Brotherhood. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=169.8s)]
*  And Syria, as we've just seen, is very much in play. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  Will Syria continue to fragment? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  Can it hold together? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Will it be dominated by one group? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Will the Turks run it from behind? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=186.44s)]
*  It's very much in play. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=191.52s)]
*  I mean, Hezbollah, as you've suggested, has been kind of suffocated by Syria's fall because [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  it's much harder for Iran to get stuff to Hezbollah in Lebanon if Syria is contained. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=198.8s)]
*  So it raises the interesting question of whether Hezbollah, which has been very badly hit, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  might become again more involved with politics and charitable work and less worried about [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=212.12s)]
*  attacking Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  Hamas, as we know, is devastated. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=221.24s)]
*  But what next in Gaza? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=224.08s)]
*  There's a big discussion to be had there, if you like. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=226.64s)]
*  Israel is basically, the war is pretty much over there, but Israel has failed to produce [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=230.88s)]
*  the political conclusion that would let them leave. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=236.55999999999997s)]
*  And I'm not sure they want to leave. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=241.26s)]
*  Iran is looking quite naked, looking for a nuclear deal with Trump, perhaps, to forestall [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=243.83999999999997s)]
*  any chance of an Israeli attack. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  And also, it has to worry about internal unrest. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=252.92s)]
*  Trump wouldn't join an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program, but he might sanction it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  And also, he might not bother too much if Israel moves to annex more parts of the West [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=262.91999999999996s)]
*  Bank, like the Jordan Valley. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=269.08s)]
*  So there's a lot to play for and a lot of uncertainty, but there's no question that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=272.32s)]
*  to some degree, setting the agenda now, and Iran is very much weakened. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=278.72s)]
*  When you say, we'll see if Israel goes too far, it seems like they've been going too [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=284.72s)]
*  far for months and months and months and months. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=288.68s)]
*  I mean, Gaza is complete rubble. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=291.36s)]
*  Lebanon was a considerable amount of rubble. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  At the same time, they have to feel like they're winning, although that's sort of a short-term [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  win, isn't it? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=302.68s)]
*  And a lot of generational, potentially, enemies themselves. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=303.68s)]
*  What's the feeling inside of Israel? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=307.88s)]
*  Do they feel like we've won, so let's take more? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=309.32s)]
*  Or do they feel like now's the time to try to negotiate a peace? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=313.08s)]
*  Well, the strangest thing, of course, is Bibi Netanyahu is still very, very unpopular. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=317.32s)]
*  And people are very divided over his domestic reforms, judicial reforms. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=322.92s)]
*  But they've been very united in the war against Hamas and definitely the war against Hezbollah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=329.16s)]
*  They had been preparing a war against Hezbollah for a long time, much more than Gaza. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=335.12s)]
*  That was the surprise. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=339.76000000000005s)]
*  And in a way, Hamas broke the reticence, if you like. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=341.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it justified a war from Israel that they could call defensive against Hezbollah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=345.92s)]
*  And I must say the way the Israeli army beat Hezbollah or attacked Hezbollah was in some [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=353.16s)]
*  sense brilliant. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  Gaza remains a mess because Gaza's an orphan. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=360.72s)]
*  Nobody wants Gaza except Hamas and maybe the crazy far-right Israelis to talk about settling [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=363.72s)]
*  it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  But I fear Gaza in its state of ruin will be occupied essentially by Israel for quite [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  a long time to come. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  It's never going to give up security control to another grouping, particularly along its [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=380.08s)]
*  border. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=386.24s)]
*  And you know, they're talking about some form of Palestinian fig leaf to govern Gaza while [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=387.52s)]
*  even hiring security firms from outside to do policing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=395.88s)]
*  In the meantime, the Israelis are moving people out of northern Gaza. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=401.68s)]
*  And then want to screen them before they're allowed back in. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=406.92s)]
*  So there's a lot unclear about what's going to happen. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  And the devastation is obvious. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think Israel will feel safer for quite a long time to come, but not sustainable. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  And it is much more isolated in the world. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=427.14s)]
*  I mean, its reputation has been deeply damaged by, you know, the brutality of a lot of the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=430.16s)]
*  war. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=436.56s)]
*  Now, one can argue they were fighting a group in tunnels and amid civilians. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=437.56s)]
*  But the fact is they were using very, very heavy weaponry. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=442.76000000000005s)]
*  And I'm sure we will find there have been numerous indications of overuse of force and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  even war crimes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=454.32000000000005s)]
*  So it is unclear what Israel has failed to do from the very beginning, partly because [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=456.2s)]
*  Netanyahu doesn't seem to want to end the war because he'll have to deal with the political [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=461.56s)]
*  consequences of the war ending, is produce a sustainable political conclusion to a war [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=465.92s)]
*  that's effectively finished in Gaza. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=473.76s)]
*  So does that mean he's going to prolong it by occupying Syria as well? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=476.72s)]
*  I mean, does that buy him more time politically? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=480.4s)]
*  I don't think that's it so much. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=482.72s)]
*  I think, again, that's defensive. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=485.72s)]
*  I mean, I was just in the United Arab Emirates. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=487.44000000000005s)]
*  They're very worried about Syria too. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the new leader of Syria, who's Al Jelani, he's named himself after the Golanites, right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=492.72s)]
*  So Israel is a bit nervous. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=502.72s)]
*  He's saying all the right things about inclusiveness and one hopes that's true. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=504.68s)]
*  But half of Syria was displaced or in exile. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=509.12s)]
*  The country we call Syria doesn't exist anymore. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=513.6s)]
*  So I think Israel's very worried that there will be a fragmented Syria. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=517.52s)]
*  Assad was horrible, but he kept the border calm. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=522.0400000000001s)]
*  And now there's a lot of anxiety. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  So I hope it's just a temporary protection to seize the buffer zone. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=528.0s)]
*  But I think Netanyahu is feeling his oats and I no longer fully feel I understand him, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=533.96s)]
*  to be honest. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=540.84s)]
*  Steve, I had one more question on the Middle East before we go on to talking about Ukraine, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=541.88s)]
*  which there's a lot to discuss there too. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=546.4s)]
*  But as you travel through the region, I'm just wondering whether you could say a little [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=548.72s)]
*  bit more about how surprising the development was in Syria and whether there's other places [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=551.32s)]
*  we should maybe be looking for where you might see something like that emerge. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=557.2s)]
*  I mean, this was a, as you say, it was this festering conflict, huge amount of displaced [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=561.52s)]
*  and turned out to have a hollowed out regime sitting on top of it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=567.0s)]
*  Should we be looking at Yemen or even parts of Iraq for something surprising to happen? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=570.88s)]
*  Or is that a little bit too speculative? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=575.32s)]
*  No, I think that's a very good question. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=576.84s)]
*  I mean, Syria happened. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=578.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=580.32s)]
*  Because Iran's weaker, Russia's weaker. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=581.32s)]
*  Russia's preoccupied in Ukraine. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=583.32s)]
*  Iran is very, very badly damaged. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=586.12s)]
*  And so the Turks, because the Turks drove this in Syria, the Turks said go and everything [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=589.72s)]
*  collapsed as in Afghanistan. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=597.08s)]
*  I mean, it was rotten. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=599.16s)]
*  The Turks are now going to be very powerful inside Syria. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=601.04s)]
*  And again, that's not something that pleases the Saudis or the Gulfis, first of all, because [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  Turks aren't Arabs and they're not Sunni. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  And they're very close, as I said, to the Muslim Brotherhood. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=614.68s)]
*  I'm worried about Iran, frankly, or maybe Iran should be worried about itself, because [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=617.12s)]
*  there is already a lot of political domestic unrest, a lot of unhappiness. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=623.04s)]
*  It's one of the reasons the Supreme Leader allowed the so-called reformer Pazesh Kian [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=629.48s)]
*  to be elected as president. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=634.8399999999999s)]
*  And he is trying to create a circumstance to lift economic sanctions. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  So they've made an approach to the Trump people. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=646.64s)]
*  The view in Iran, though it's controversial, is let's give Trump a chance to do a new nuclear [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=649.92s)]
*  deal because Trump has the Senate and he could do a sustainable deal and get some economic [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=657.28s)]
*  relief to calm people down at home. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=663.0s)]
*  And if we're engaged doing that, then Israel's not going to attack us to get rid of our nuclear [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=666.6s)]
*  program. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=672.68s)]
*  But if it fails and the timing is quite short, I mean, they'd have to have a deal in the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=673.76s)]
*  next six months or so. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=678.76s)]
*  It gets complicated. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=680.56s)]
*  But there are international sections that would snap back in October, which would double [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=681.68s)]
*  the pain for Iran. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=687.04s)]
*  If that doesn't work, then I fear there's a lot of IRGC interest in going ahead to have [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=689.24s)]
*  a nuclear deterrent, which could produce Israeli bombing using very powerful American bombs [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=696.52s)]
*  that Trump might give them and Biden would not have given. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=705.0s)]
*  So I think the potential for more domestic unrest in Iran is the thing I'm looking for, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=709.76s)]
*  to be honest. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=717.24s)]
*  Well, we can talk for hours on this. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=718.5999999999999s)]
*  I know Carla would love to as well. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=720.5999999999999s)]
*  It could be the Mideast Next Year podcast or something. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  But let's move on to the other very big front that you're obviously very familiar with as [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=725.0s)]
*  well, which is Ukraine. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=729.24s)]
*  So the Ukrainian leader Zelensky has been reaching out assiduously to Trump. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=730.68s)]
*  He went to Paris for a last minute meeting. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=735.4s)]
*  He's been posting a series of tweets that are certainly flattering and trying to be [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=737.6s)]
*  confidence building, it looks like, from the tone. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=741.92s)]
*  The Ukrainians also this week just took responsibility for assassinating a top Russian general in [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=744.28s)]
*  Moscow, in the middle of Moscow, another bold act. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=748.96s)]
*  The Russians themselves have been launching bolder and bolder attacks, even though Trump [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=751.92s)]
*  has urged both sides to kind of ramp it down. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=755.36s)]
*  So are we seeing some strategy in these acts from Ukrainian side or the Russian side for [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  that matter? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  I think there's a lot of anxiety in Europe too, not just Ukraine about what Trump wants [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  to do, because I don't think Trump knows what he wants to do. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=769.8s)]
*  Trump wants to end Biden's wars, both in the Middle East and in Ukraine. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=773.68s)]
*  I don't think Trump cares that much about who's – [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=779.9599999999999s)]
*  What he says of Biden's words. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=782.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, of course. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=784.16s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=785.9599999999999s)]
*  Precisely right. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=786.9599999999999s)]
*  Biden invaded Ukraine or anything. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=787.96s)]
*  I mean, but the problem is I don't think Trump cares whose interests are sacrificed [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=790.88s)]
*  if he's going to get a ceasefire. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=796.84s)]
*  And Ukraine is losing the war. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  Now it's losing the war slowly. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=801.72s)]
*  Everyone's trying to ensure it doesn't lose it suddenly. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=804.64s)]
*  And Ruta, Mark Ruta, who's the new NATO secretary general, and the Europeans have been meeting [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=808.9200000000001s)]
*  our meeting to try to do two things. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=815.64s)]
*  One is to figure out how to prop up Ukraine with more supplies and air defense to get [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=818.6s)]
*  into the spring when most people think negotiations might be possible, get through this horrible [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=825.12s)]
*  winter. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=830.92s)]
*  And secondly, to show Donald Trump that they're prepared to do more for Ukraine and prepared [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=832.0s)]
*  to do some burden shifting away from the United States. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  Now Ukraine has plenty of money now through next year because of the use by the G7 of [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=843.3199999999999s)]
*  these frozen Russian assets. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=850.16s)]
*  They've amortized them. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=851.92s)]
*  So Ukraine has money, but it has a morale problem. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=853.64s)]
*  It's losing territory. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  It has a mobilization problem. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=860.36s)]
*  The Russians are destroying its infrastructure, destroying the heating system, the energy [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=863.24s)]
*  system. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  And there's a legitimate question about whether if the war keeps going but doesn't change [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=870.4399999999999s)]
*  very much on the ground, whether there shouldn't be negotiations sooner rather than later to [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=876.72s)]
*  preserve more of what's left of Ukraine. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=882.84s)]
*  The problem is the Ukrainians want to keep fighting. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=887.12s)]
*  They will keep fighting. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=892.1999999999999s)]
*  And how do you convince Putin to negotiate seriously? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=894.2s)]
*  That's the conundrum everybody has because Putin thinks he's winning the war. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=898.44s)]
*  And if you think you're winning the war, you're not going to compromise. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=903.8000000000001s)]
*  And having lived in Russia, one thing I'll tell you, if someone asks for compromise to [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=906.96s)]
*  a Russian, they hit you harder because they think that's a sign of weakness. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=911.4000000000001s)]
*  So right now I think Trump could get Putin into talks with Zelensky maybe in the spring, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=917.12s)]
*  but on the basis of what exactly? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=925.1600000000001s)]
*  And I think Putin at the minimum would at least demand a Ukraine never inside NATO with [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=927.88s)]
*  a smaller military. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=934.48s)]
*  And he would want to take the territories that he has and the ones he's formally annexed, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=936.84s)]
*  which I think is unacceptable to the Ukrainians. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=942.88s)]
*  So some people suggest in Washington, oh, you know, Putin's under his great financial [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=945.64s)]
*  squeeze because there's a lot of inflation, which there is. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=950.88s)]
*  Interest rates are really high and business people are unhappy. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=955.8s)]
*  But frankly, I think for Putin, this has become an existential war. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=960.52s)]
*  This is the war that will make his legacy one way or another. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=964.52s)]
*  So the hope is you get negotiations in the spring. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=970.88s)]
*  The other big question is really about Europe more than Trump. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=974.86s)]
*  Do the Europeans really see Russia as a generational threat? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=980.6s)]
*  And are they willing to react with a serious buildup of military deterrence, including [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=986.72s)]
*  the money that needs to be spent? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=993.52s)]
*  Or do they just kind of hope it'll all go away? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=996.6s)]
*  I mean, that's still not clear yet. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=999.24s)]
*  If you look at the things that Trump has said, basically what they seem to be betting on [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1002.32s)]
*  is that Putin will come to the table because they're willing to stop the war in place, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1007.96s)]
*  that Ukrainians won't agree to give up any land, but it'll be a frozen conflict in place, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1014.32s)]
*  and that there'll be some indefinite commitment that Ukraine won't join NATO and that the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1021.5600000000001s)]
*  Ukrainians will have to accept that because the Americans won't give them any more weapons. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1028.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, there's that. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1032.24s)]
*  And of course, the Europeans will try. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1033.24s)]
*  I mean, now, for example, shells. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1035.16s)]
*  The Ukrainians are doing fine with shells. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1037.04s)]
*  I mean, British intelligence says the Ukrainians have one shell for every 1.5 Russian shells. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1038.84s)]
*  So they're in better shape on shells than they've been in a long time. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1045.6s)]
*  Artillery shells. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1049.16s)]
*  Artillery shells, yeah. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1050.16s)]
*  But what they don't have is the air defenses because nobody has them and they don't have [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1051.16s)]
*  the manpower. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1054.6s)]
*  And then there's the other issue, which is always out there, which is what will Ukraine [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1056.16s)]
*  be willing to sacrifice and who will protect Ukraine if there is a deal? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1063.56s)]
*  What will prevent Putin or Putin's successors from starting this up again in the next three [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1071.44s)]
*  or four years or even moving on Moldova or a place like that? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1077.72s)]
*  And that's a serious question because then you get into the question of can you have [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1083.1599999999999s)]
*  a Ukraine in NATO or a partial Ukraine in NATO and how would you do that? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1086.7s)]
*  There's talk about putting European troops as peacekeepers in Ukraine, which I think [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1091.96s)]
*  is kind of a mad idea, frankly. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1097.04s)]
*  But there is this question of how Ukraine has the guarantees or the assurances that [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1099.4s)]
*  Russia won't do this again in three or four years, that this negotiation would only be [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1107.24s)]
*  temporary. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1112.42s)]
*  And then there's a kind of Ukrainian fantasy, which is that Trump makes Putin an offer that [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1113.8400000000001s)]
*  Putin has to refuse and Trump gets angry with Putin and so starts feeding Ukraine lots of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1119.86s)]
*  weapons. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1126.58s)]
*  But I think that feels like a fantasy. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1128.08s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1130.02s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing about Trump is how unpredictable he is. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1131.02s)]
*  And the other thing about Trump is that they tend to go into negotiations without any planning. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1134.58s)]
*  I mean, he went to these meetings with the North Koreans and there wasn't a single principles [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1138.4199999999998s)]
*  committee before that. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1143.06s)]
*  There were no planning because he believes that somehow he can get in the room and there [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1144.72s)]
*  can be a deal. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1148.58s)]
*  So unpredictability is intrinsic to the Trump style, along with his transactional nature. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1149.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1156.5s)]
*  And also, I mean, one can imagine, you know, as there was with North Korea, a huge amount [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1157.5s)]
*  of media interest and talks and this and that and, you know, a big meeting. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1162.78s)]
*  And then as with North Korea, kind of nothing much happens. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1168.6599999999999s)]
*  That could be true, too. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1173.5s)]
*  The differences, of course, Ukraine is getting pounded along the way. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1175.6999999999998s)]
*  With North Korea, it was photo upland. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1178.54s)]
*  So precisely. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1180.8999999999999s)]
*  And Steve, you mentioned earlier, you know, Europe reckoning with Russia. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1181.8999999999999s)]
*  I was just wondering if you could talk a slight bit more about how Europeans feel, especially [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1185.42s)]
*  the ones maybe closer in proximity to Ukraine, whether you are sensing maybe it's sort of [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1190.3s)]
*  an anecdotal thing at this point, but a greater feeling of getting their security house in [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1196.22s)]
*  order and really being willing to sort of knuckle down on defense spending and things [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1201.32s)]
*  like that because of a new landscape. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1206.02s)]
*  No, that's absolutely true. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1208.26s)]
*  And that's been happening. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1209.74s)]
*  I mean, it would be unfair to say that NATO and Europe haven't been doing much, but they've [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1210.74s)]
*  been responding after 2022, not after 2014 when Crimea was annexed. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1217.14s)]
*  So they and I think the United States, too, lost a lot of time, basically, because I don't [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1223.66s)]
*  think they saw Ukraine then as a security interest that mattered very much. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1230.3s)]
*  It was always the borderland. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1235.94s)]
*  But now I think they see Russia as aggressive, Russia as having large ambitions to overturn [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1238.28s)]
*  the European security order and to undermine NATO. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1245.74s)]
*  So you have the Poles who, you know, are spending more than 4% of GDP now on defense, but a [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1250.58s)]
*  lot of it's going to big American military equipment like F-35s. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1258.8999999999999s)]
*  You have the Baltic nations spending a lot on defense, but they're tiny, so that doesn't [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1263.9399999999998s)]
*  make that much difference. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1268.62s)]
*  But they do want to fight and they are pushing. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1270.46s)]
*  And you see even in the European Union with the new leaders, Ursula von der Leyen remains [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1273.9399999999998s)]
*  the same, but Kaia Khalis, and they even have a defense commissioner now, there is more [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1280.02s)]
*  of an understanding that they need to beef up for their own sake their deterrence. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1286.66s)]
*  And then, of course, that makes more urgent because anxiety about what Donald Trump's [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1295.26s)]
*  going to do. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1302.06s)]
*  I mean, no one really expects him to pull out of NATO. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1303.26s)]
*  But at the same time, I mean, one could see him trying to get some kind of ceasefire in [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1306.58s)]
*  Ukraine and then saying to the Europeans, now it's your problem. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1312.26s)]
*  You do it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1316.34s)]
*  You protect Ukraine, right? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1317.34s)]
*  We're busy with China. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1319.78s)]
*  So there is anxiety. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1321.54s)]
*  People are trying to come up with the right offer to satisfy the Don because Trump tends [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1323.74s)]
*  to see NATO as a protection racket. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1329.74s)]
*  Everybody's paying the Americans. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1333.26s)]
*  And there may be a point because, for example, in Japan and South Korea, they do help pay [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1336.58s)]
*  for the American military support. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1343.34s)]
*  So why shouldn't Europe help pay directly, some people around Trump might ask, which [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1345.94s)]
*  is not a stupid question. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1351.54s)]
*  So I think there is an understanding, but the farther you get away, as you implied, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1354.18s)]
*  from the border, right, I mean, the less interest there is. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1359.54s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't interest the Spanish, the Portuguese very much. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1363.42s)]
*  Even the Germans would still, I think, like it all to be over so they could go back to [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1367.8200000000002s)]
*  the way it was. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1372.42s)]
*  The Germans did this big so-called Seitenwende with 100 billion euros, but frankly, for [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1374.38s)]
*  the German military to be decent, it needs two more Seitenwendes. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1380.38s)]
*  And right now the money just isn't there. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1386.7s)]
*  I mean, there is a sense, and certainly in Western Europe, there was an alarm ringing, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1389.94s)]
*  and then they hit the snooze button. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1395.46s)]
*  And there are some people who are arguing they need to think harder. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1398.46s)]
*  The likely winner of the next German election is from the Christian Democrats and is tougher [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1402.7s)]
*  on Ukraine. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1408.82s)]
*  But as I said, there's a lot of anxiety and there's not tons of money around. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1410.82s)]
*  So Carla, in Europe, people have been watching Trump assemble his national security team [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1416.7s)]
*  with a mixture of befuddlement, of amusement and dismay. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1423.6599999999999s)]
*  And they seem contradictory. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1429.62s)]
*  I mean, are his picks going to make it through the Senate? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1431.1799999999998s)]
*  What do they say about a second term Trump foreign policy? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1433.82s)]
*  Well, we're feeling the mixture of befuddlement, amusement and dismay, depending on the day [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1437.1799999999998s)]
*  of the week as well. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1442.1399999999999s)]
*  Most of these choices seem designed as much to own liberals, in some cases actually break [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1443.6599999999999s)]
*  the departments they're supposed to run. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1448.4399999999998s)]
*  There doesn't seem, based on those choices, an intention to forge a particularly coherent [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1451.3s)]
*  set of new policies. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1455.8999999999999s)]
*  In the national security sphere, the most, how do I put this delicately, the controversial [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1458.14s)]
*  picks are Pete Hegseth for defense, who's talked about firing woke generals, including [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1463.38s)]
*  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, seems to want to bar women from combat. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1467.8600000000001s)]
*  The pick for FBI, I didn't think that Trump could surprise me anymore. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1472.38s)]
*  This is the one who probably surprised me the most was Cash Patel. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1476.5s)]
*  He's vowed to fire the top ranks of the agency. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1479.5800000000002s)]
*  He has a whole declared list of enemies, which includes, I mean, the predictable soon to [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1482.38s)]
*  be former president Biden, Hillary Clinton, even the former CIA director, Gina Haspel. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1487.14s)]
*  I don't know what she did to annoy him so much. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1491.9s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, you know, friend to Bashar Assad and Vladimir Putin. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1494.7800000000002s)]
*  But there are a few more mainstream picks. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1498.74s)]
*  Florida Senator Marco Rubio, he's got to be well known to the Europeans for secretary [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1500.66s)]
*  of state. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1504.26s)]
*  He used to be a traditional GOP, a hawk, but an internationalist and a free trader. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1505.26s)]
*  He has adapted to MAGA world and he's become a Ukraine aid skeptic. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1510.16s)]
*  But I think if you sort of push him a little harder, I think you'll find a traditional [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1514.58s)]
*  GOP hawk and national security adviser, Mike Walt. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1519.1s)]
*  I don't know how well he known he is to the Europeans, but no fan of Europe. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1522.78s)]
*  They're much more focused like let's not waste our money in Ukraine. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1527.1399999999999s)]
*  Let's look on China. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1529.86s)]
*  As for the confirmation process, we'll see. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1532.12s)]
*  I think at this point, there probably will be a confirmation process. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1534.7s)]
*  It was in question for a long time there. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1538.08s)]
*  If you recall, Trump was pushing them. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1539.82s)]
*  I want my recess appointments. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1541.74s)]
*  He seems to have dropped this suggestion because the Senate seems to be moving ahead, willing [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1544.66s)]
*  to at least seriously consider most of his people. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1550.06s)]
*  If I had to predict the person who's in the most trouble right now, it's Hegseth. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1553.5s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1557.82s)]
*  He, of course, in addition to his controversial positions, he's been accused in the past [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1558.82s)]
*  of sexual assault. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1564.42s)]
*  He paid a woman off. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1565.98s)]
*  He says he's going to let her out of her NDA. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1567.28s)]
*  We'll see whether that actually happens. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1569.7s)]
*  We know in the past from Kavanaugh and from Clarence Thomas that the Congress does not [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1572.3s)]
*  treat accusers nicely. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1577.28s)]
*  This could turn into an incredible circus. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1578.76s)]
*  Right now, he's probably the one who's in the most trouble. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1581.52s)]
*  As for how these nominees are going to shape Trump's positions on foreign policy, this [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1584.8s)]
*  is really not a team of rivals. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1589.38s)]
*  There seems to be basic consensus. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1591.22s)]
*  Everybody wants to end the war in Ukraine, even if it means Ukraine makes all the sacrifices. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1594.02s)]
*  Ukraine is the prime threat, Rubio and Walz in particular, the fiercest of China hawks. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1599.3s)]
*  Interestingly, Rubio is going to be the first secretary of state, not only the first Latino [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1604.18s)]
*  secretary of state, he's going to be the first secretary of state who's under travel [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1608.54s)]
*  sanctions from the Chinese. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1612.4199999999998s)]
*  We'll see if the Chinese back off that. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1613.8999999999999s)]
*  Iran is a serious runner up. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1616.62s)]
*  We were talking about the possibility of a nuclear deal. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1618.62s)]
*  No friends to Iran among this group. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1620.82s)]
*  Beating up on Europe is everyone's favorite pastime. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1623.26s)]
*  How's that going to play out in practice? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1625.74s)]
*  Iran in the past has praised Xi Jinping and the Chinese are still talking about the possibility [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1628.6200000000001s)]
*  of a grand bargain. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1632.6200000000001s)]
*  If allies and adversaries are calculating how they can appeal to Trump's transactional [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1634.66s)]
*  nature, I suspect that the officials around him, if they're anything like those in the [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1639.74s)]
*  first administration, they're going to have to calculate either how they distract Trump [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1644.78s)]
*  from the latest bright and shiny offer, or they're going to have to grit their teeth [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1649.26s)]
*  and adapt as he adapts his convictions because he's not consistent. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1653.18s)]
*  And you saw this with John Bolton, you saw this with pretty much everybody else around [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1658.38s)]
*  him in the first term. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1662.22s)]
*  If you're a true believer on anything, you end up getting out of the way. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1663.8600000000001s)]
*  One of the things that I've always thought about is John Bolton's line about Trump. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1668.5s)]
*  He says Trump has a mind like a pinball machine. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1673.3s)]
*  So it sort of bounces from one thing to another, and then he likes to make decisions. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1677.14s)]
*  One thing I'm curious about, I don't know whether you have a sense of this, does he [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1684.1000000000001s)]
*  actually care about Taiwan? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1687.3000000000002s)]
*  Or in his mind, is Taiwan kind of like Ukraine and it belongs to the bigger empire? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1690.18s)]
*  I think that when he's talked about Taiwan, he's talked about it the way he's talked [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1696.22s)]
*  about every other dependency, why aren't they paying more? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1701.0600000000002s)]
*  He's talked about South Korea that way, he's talked about Japan that way, why aren't [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1705.58s)]
*  they paying more? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1709.1s)]
*  When you talk about protection rackets, I think that is basically it. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1710.3799999999999s)]
*  But these people like Rubio and Walz don't feel that way. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1714.34s)]
*  Can they persuade him? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1719.12s)]
*  There is certainly no sign from the first administration, people were able in the first [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1720.2199999999998s)]
*  administration to stop him from doing things, to stop him from bombing places, to stop him [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1724.86s)]
*  from taking extreme positions. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1729.8999999999999s)]
*  But were they able to persuade him to make a strong ideological or moral commitment to [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1732.38s)]
*  some campaign, to some country? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1740.0200000000002s)]
*  There's no sign of that. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1744.1000000000001s)]
*  Carl, I'm wondering about your thoughts on what sort of role Republicans in Congress [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1745.1000000000001s)]
*  might have that, let's say, differs from the first Trump administration, where you [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1750.5800000000002s)]
*  had some in positions of power, like Mitch McConnell, you had some Republicans who are [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1754.5s)]
*  more traditional internationalists, strong defense, and in some cases, pulled some strings [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1758.54s)]
*  to make sure certain funding on whatever foreign aid or other priorities continued, despite [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1764.5s)]
*  attempts by the Trump administration to deplete those or to reduce those. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1770.18s)]
*  So do you see anything this time around? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1774.8600000000001s)]
*  Much has been made about how he has even more asserted his role and influence in Congress. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1777.1000000000001s)]
*  I think that you're right. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1783.46s)]
*  I think that people are even more frightened of him. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1785.82s)]
*  And Ukraine was a big test. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1789.06s)]
*  They managed to pull it off with this last funding round. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1791.06s)]
*  Ukraine fatigue is certainly set in up there. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1794.6999999999998s)]
*  But the big test probably will be in these confirmation hearings. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1796.78s)]
*  Kash Patel, who surprised me when they nominated him, it's been nothing but a love fest for [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1801.6999999999998s)]
*  him up there. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1806.1s)]
*  Enemies list, who cares? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1807.6599999999999s)]
*  Nobody's making a big deal about this. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1809.46s)]
*  We'll see with the Hegseth hearings. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1811.1399999999999s)]
*  I think that's a big, big test there, not necessarily on foreign aid or foreign policy, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1812.58s)]
*  but I think that's a big test on who's willing to stand up to Trump. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1818.1s)]
*  Interestingly, all of the complaints about Hegseth, all the concerns about Hegseth have [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1822.74s)]
*  been focused on this sexual assault allegation. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1827.6999999999998s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that no one should focus on that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1831.1s)]
*  That's an absolutely essential question, sexual assault and allegations of drinking on the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1833.54s)]
*  job. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1837.3799999999999s)]
*  But there doesn't seem to be much of a discussion on no women in combat, firing woke generals, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1838.68s)]
*  the question of LGBTQ people serving Marxism. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1845.3600000000001s)]
*  There's been no discussion at all of that and the question of the implications of what [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1848.88s)]
*  that would do to good order in the force. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1852.72s)]
*  We haven't even gotten into the policies that he could potentially promulgate and how [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1855.04s)]
*  it would affect the ability of the US military to cohere. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1859.38s)]
*  There has been no policy discussion. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1863.52s)]
*  So if he actually gets to hearings, which it looks like he will, and people ask him [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1865.18s)]
*  substantive questions beyond this issue of sexual assault, we'll see whether people [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1871.5s)]
*  are willing to challenge President Trump and his choice. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1876.5800000000002s)]
*  There was a while a few weeks ago that it looked like after the Matt Gaetz dropping [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1879.52s)]
*  that nomination there, it looked like that Trump might drop Hegseth as well. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1883.46s)]
*  But he's a very proud man, as we well know, and he didn't want to go for two. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1888.44s)]
*  So right now he's still backing Hegseth up and we'll see how that one plays up on [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1892.5s)]
*  the Hill. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1897.06s)]
*  I think it's going to be a big test of the question you've raised there, Bob. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1898.06s)]
*  Bob, year of elections is wrapping up, but the elections aren't over. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1900.78s)]
*  This week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote, which means they're going [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1905.0s)]
*  to hold snap elections on February 23rd. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1909.58s)]
*  And Europe's largest economy is going to be in the hands of a caretaker government [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1912.86s)]
*  until then. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1916.24s)]
*  And France, of course, barely has a government itself. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1917.24s)]
*  And those are two of the world's great electoral democracies. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1920.06s)]
*  How are you feeling about the state of elections these days? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1923.1s)]
*  Well, the state of elections and by extension, the state of democracy are in a very tricky [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1925.3s)]
*  place. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1930.22s)]
*  You know, these elections and it was an epic year, something like four billion people voted. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1931.22s)]
*  And this is a wide range, obviously, of, let's say, mature democracies and countries that [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1936.1s)]
*  are more on the edge. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1940.34s)]
*  And you definitely had, in some cases, some stage managing going on, whether it was the [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1941.8999999999999s)]
*  basic succession that was sort of preordained in a place like Indonesia or more recently, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1946.26s)]
*  funny business that took place in one time EU aspirant Georgia. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1952.74s)]
*  Both are cases where sort of illiberal forces held sway. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1957.34s)]
*  And then where there weren't, say, stage managing going on, there was they throw out the incumbent [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1961.42s)]
*  wave that, you know, affected everybody from the United States to countries across Europe [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1966.02s)]
*  and certainly in Asia. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1970.86s)]
*  And then on top of it, another drama playing out at the end of this year is the erstwhile, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1972.66s)]
*  stable, vibrant democracy of South Korea dealing with a martial law declaration that lasted, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1977.14s)]
*  I think, six hours or so. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1982.5400000000002s)]
*  Now you have an impeachment proceeding going on against the president who declared martial [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1984.24s)]
*  law. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1988.18s)]
*  That's going to play out in the course of the early year. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1989.18s)]
*  As you said, Germany and France, two pillars of Europe are in a very tough spot going into [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1992.5400000000002s)]
*  the year. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1998.26s)]
*  You'll have the year beginning with weak governments in both places. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=1999.26s)]
*  So you could see Germany come back with a stronger government under Merz. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2002.42s)]
*  That remains to be seen. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2005.8600000000001s)]
*  There certainly is that possibility. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2006.9s)]
*  In France, there's a lot more doubt as far as that goes. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2008.66s)]
*  And the common thread through all these things are that populations are pretty miffed, to [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2012.3000000000002s)]
*  say the least, at the state of their economies. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2016.98s)]
*  There is a direct correlation in a number of places between inflation levels, cost of [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2019.94s)]
*  living levels, inequality, and the incumbents, you know, with a big target on them as this [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2024.24s)]
*  is playing out. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2029.0600000000002s)]
*  Add to that the higher flows of immigration, even with the trouble some of these economies [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2030.66s)]
*  you're dealing with, they are still beacons compared to other parts of the world. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2034.1000000000001s)]
*  And so people are flocking to Europe, United States, from places like Central America or [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2036.98s)]
*  the Middle East and North Africa. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2043.42s)]
*  And so you have all these stresses. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2045.46s)]
*  And on top of it, you have the tampering of the misinformation brigades, whether it's [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2046.98s)]
*  coming from Russia and in some cases from China or other places, other malign actors. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2052.1s)]
*  We're definitely seeing dedicated campaigns to messing around with public information [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2058.86s)]
*  and sort of raising real doubts about what's a fact and what's not and whipping up concern [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2063.78s)]
*  in a lot of places. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2068.94s)]
*  And the weaker the country's infrastructure and institutions are, the more those types [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2069.94s)]
*  of campaigns hold sway. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2074.6600000000003s)]
*  Another country that's dealing with struggles at the end of the year, in part driven by [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2076.48s)]
*  these misinformation campaigns, is Romania, which had its presidential election annulled [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2080.54s)]
*  by its constitutional court. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2085.04s)]
*  So we're ending the year on a really tough note for democracy. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2086.76s)]
*  It was both resilient and fragile at the same time, depending on where you looked. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2091.0800000000004s)]
*  Next year, just a quick peek ahead, it's not going to be like this past year in terms of [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2095.96s)]
*  the sheer number and the heavyweight aspect of the elections. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2100.0400000000004s)]
*  But there are elections that are going to be coming up in important US allies like Australia [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2104.28s)]
*  and Canada. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2109.0400000000004s)]
*  There will be an early harbinger of the sort of Russian near abroad in Belarus, which is [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2110.34s)]
*  not going to be a free election by any stretch of the imagination, but will still be an indicator [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2115.68s)]
*  of how much enthrall that country is still to its dictator Lukashenko, who five years [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2119.3599999999997s)]
*  ago was seen to be in a much tougher spot. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2124.64s)]
*  So we end this year and we begin next year with elections and democracy being in a very [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2127.62s)]
*  puzzling spot. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2132.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2133.68s)]
*  And Bob, what interests me partly about Europe is with Hungary, the struggle over Romania, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2134.68s)]
*  Georgia, you have a presidential election coming up in Poland, which will be a big test [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2141.72s)]
*  of whether law and justice comes back to power a bit or not. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2148.92s)]
*  So I think in Central Europe, there's a lot to play for. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2155.92s)]
*  And this all is in the context of what to do about Russia. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2159.24s)]
*  And so I think these votes will make a tremendous difference. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2164.74s)]
*  So much of the pitch that the Russians when they were putting out their arguments, whether [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2168.64s)]
*  you want to call it disinformation or just their arguments was some of these places, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2173.6s)]
*  you don't want to end up like Ukraine. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2178.6s)]
*  So don't vote for Europe, vote for neutrality or vote for peace. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2180.42s)]
*  Does that play in Western Europe itself? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2185.52s)]
*  It plays in Germany, parts of Germany. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2189.12s)]
*  Germany has always been a bit neurologic anyway. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2191.68s)]
*  It sees itself as a peace loving expander of peace, given its history. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2194.96s)]
*  It's not been very interested in war. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2201.44s)]
*  But in East Germany, which the old DDR, which still has a kind of basic lasting anti-Americanism [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2204.32s)]
*  and a fear that, for example, Ukraine is somehow a proxy war between Russia and the United [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2211.2s)]
*  States and that the Germans are going to get dragged into this war and be a victim somehow [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2220.04s)]
*  of bigger powers. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2226.8s)]
*  And so you have with the Alternative for Germany party, which may end up being the second largest [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2229.08s)]
*  party in Germany, and this new party around this woman called Zara Vagenecht, you have [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2235.12s)]
*  basically the Russian narrative, which is Ukraine is not our fight and the war threatens [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2241.96s)]
*  us. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2249.56s)]
*  So, I mean, this feeds with anti-migration feeling and anger basically at elites. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2250.56s)]
*  So it's a pretty toxic mix, I have to say. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2256.8s)]
*  I think in Germany, it's controllable. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2259.92s)]
*  I mean, this government has fallen, but it's fallen in a way we predicted. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2262.56s)]
*  We even knew what day it would fall. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2268.52s)]
*  And I suspect, you know, it will be in power in still, I mean, until probably the end of [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2271.64s)]
*  March easily before a new government's in place. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2277.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's not perilous, but it is definitely weaker. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2281.32s)]
*  And Macron in France is definitely weaker. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2286.08s)]
*  And we'll see what happens with his government. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2289.52s)]
*  But he has three more years in power and is refusing all requests to leave early, which [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2292.68s)]
*  makes perfect sense. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2300.0s)]
*  But, you know, is anyone going to listen to French ideas now? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2301.16s)]
*  And you have a very interesting moment where you have more center right governments in [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2306.12s)]
*  Europe. And so that may augur well for more resistance to giving up on Ukraine. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2312.56s)]
*  Steve, I wonder if you're seeing the EU playing any sort of a different type of a role than [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2320.2400000000002s)]
*  expected in terms of just being a bit of a stabilizer or at least providing a little bit [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2325.28s)]
*  of a backbone because it's knitting together all these increasingly disparate parts. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2329.88s)]
*  I mean, it seems like it's going to have survived the Hungarian presidency, for example. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2335.28s)]
*  It's then going to go to Poland. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2339.92s)]
*  We'll see what that situation is like after the elections there. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2341.0s)]
*  But you mentioned Ursula von der Leyen, who's seen as this figure growing in authority or [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2342.92s)]
*  symbolic, if not otherwise, on Kyokales, certainly outspoken on the Ukraine question. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2348.12s)]
*  Is there something we should be knowing about the EU's role here or should we not overstated? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2353.92s)]
*  It's nice to see women in charge, which is more than we have here. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2357.96s)]
*  Amen to that. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2361.4s)]
*  No, I think there is a stiffening of the spine and there is a real understanding that Europe has to [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2362.96s)]
*  do more, partly because of Trump and partly in its own interests. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2370.64s)]
*  And there is, interestingly, with the pressure of Ukraine, more of a willingness of the [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2374.68s)]
*  European Union structures to work with NATO rather than against NATO. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2380.8s)]
*  And I think this is very promising if the new commission does a better job in getting European [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2388.36s)]
*  defense industries going, in particular, making things that the NATO military advisors think [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2396.36s)]
*  countries ought to have, right, as opposed to the things that each country's industry wants to make. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2405.88s)]
*  Then I think it will help because the Europeans spend a lot of money on defense, huge amounts of [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2414.52s)]
*  money. It's just there's an awful lot of inefficiency and overlapping. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2421.4s)]
*  And I think people understand that that needs to be reformed. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2426.2000000000003s)]
*  And Mark Rutte is someone who knows the European Union very well, having run the Netherlands for [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2432.12s)]
*  many, many years. He knows the players, he's trusted. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2438.2799999999997s)]
*  And so he has Trump's ear, too. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2442.7599999999998s)]
*  So I think it's promising. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2445.48s)]
*  The EU wants to do more. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2447.3199999999997s)]
*  I think the big question is, as always, money, because the EU budget by itself is quite small. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2449.8799999999997s)]
*  The new defense commissioner doesn't have a lot of money to invest. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2456.68s)]
*  And the biggest problem is if you're creating more military industry, it takes a really long [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2461.7999999999997s)]
*  time to get it going. And if for the Europeans that started this 18 months ago or 24 months ago, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2471.08s)]
*  I think I would have been much happier. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2477.8799999999997s)]
*  Mark Rutte is going to supplant Macron as the Trump whisperer. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2480.6s)]
*  Whenever Trump says anything positive about Europe, it's always Mark Rutte because he says [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2484.6s)]
*  that Mark Rutte likes him. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2489.3999999999996s)]
*  And Mark Rutte has a nice smile. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2491.24s)]
*  That's good, too. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2492.84s)]
*  And he has already met with Trump's named envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2494.44s)]
*  So he's sort of getting his ducks in a row early, it looks like. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2498.12s)]
*  Very, very much so. And also he's been very explicit, I think, in saying that Ukraine needs [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2501.96s)]
*  help to beat back the Russians to prepare for serious negotiations. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2509.16s)]
*  He's been very explicit about that. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2515.32s)]
*  And I think his words will have an impact. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2517.4s)]
*  Again, you can't figure out what the new American Congress is going to do, how much money [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2520.76s)]
*  there's going to be. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2526.76s)]
*  But even if Trump has negotiations, has a ceasefire, the implication is you can't let Ukraine [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2527.8s)]
*  collapse in the meantime. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2536.2000000000003s)]
*  So whether Washington likes it or not, I think it needs to keep supporting Ukraine with more [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2538.44s)]
*  European help. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2545.32s)]
*  But anyway, we've had a great discussion, but I don't think we can end it, this discussion [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2547.0s)]
*  about all the major issues without talking about the state of the climate, global efforts [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2552.6000000000004s)]
*  at mitigating climate warming gases. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2557.88s)]
*  Bob, can you talk about, we've made any progress last year and what we should look forward [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2561.4s)]
*  to next year? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2566.28s)]
*  Well, the trend is not our friend on climate, Steve, but there are things, as always, you [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2567.1600000000003s)]
*  can point to that you can say, you know, there are opportunities. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2572.76s)]
*  You'll hear that from climate experts and they've just had another year where the numbers [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2577.5600000000004s)]
*  are pretty grim. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2581.48s)]
*  So just to cite a few of the numbers to kick things off, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2582.6000000000004s)]
*  Administration is saying, although the full year data is not yet in, there's a 99% chance [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2587.96s)]
*  that 2024 was the hottest year on record, beating 2023. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2593.32s)]
*  And that's part of the trend I was mentioning of just hotter and hotter temperatures going [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2598.12s)]
*  on. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2603.16s)]
*  The Arctic is the part of the planet that's warming at the quickest rate. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2603.64s)]
*  And NOAA in a recent set of announcements mentioned that there was an ominous tipping [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2608.04s)]
*  point in the Arctic this year in which it moved from carbon sink to emitter because [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2613.56s)]
*  of the thawing off of the permafrost that had been trapping gases that are contributing [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2619.88s)]
*  to the global warming. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2625.4s)]
*  That's an area to be concerned about and that's only going to build. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2626.8399999999997s)]
*  Climate diplomats point to this figure that has become this goal, this seemingly impossible [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2630.12s)]
*  goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above its pre-industrial level. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2636.6s)]
*  This year, actually, it succeeded that. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2643.48s)]
*  That goal is considered lost if there's several years in a row or a number of years in a row [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2645.7999999999997s)]
*  in which that's the case. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2650.04s)]
*  There are some people who are viewing this, the pace of warming and saying, we're going [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2651.48s)]
*  to blow past that, we're going to blow past possibly 2 degrees by 2030 and maybe even [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2656.44s)]
*  4 degrees by the end of the century. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2661.32s)]
*  When you're talking about these 10 sub-degrees, you're talking about levels of devastation [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2663.08s)]
*  and extreme climate events. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2668.12s)]
*  We came through another year in which almost every corner of the planet could point to [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2669.48s)]
*  some sort of extreme weather event that they had never seen before, whether it's severe [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2672.44s)]
*  forest fires caused by drought or, conversely, heavy, heavy rain that had not been seen before. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2676.92s)]
*  We saw that here in a trio of hurricanes that hit the US, Helena in particular. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2683.0s)]
*  We just had this French Indian Ocean Territory, a maillot, if I'm pronouncing it right, that just [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2689.4s)]
*  got absolutely clobbered by a cyclone. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2694.28s)]
*  They're still trying to figure out what is the extent of the damage. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2696.84s)]
*  A fear could be in the thousands of deaths and Macron actually is going to be going there [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2699.72s)]
*  to check out the damage in person. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2704.52s)]
*  But these types of events are happening at greater, greater frequency and they're expensive. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2706.68s)]
*  Just in the US alone, as of November 1st, there were $24 billion disaster events. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2710.84s)]
*  These are events in which you're going to involve not only rebuilding, but attempts [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2716.6000000000004s)]
*  at mitigation, creating better ability to withstand high winds and rains and so forth. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2720.76s)]
*  These are the terms we're going to continue to hear more and more of because we heard [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2727.6400000000003s)]
*  them at the year-end COP meeting in Azerbaijan, or mitigation and adaptation. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2730.36s)]
*  This was supposed to be the climate finance COP. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2734.52s)]
*  Most of the experts who studied this approach to dealing with climate change have talked about [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2737.08s)]
*  the trillions of dollars needed in commitments on an annual basis. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2742.36s)]
*  They came up with less than $300 billion, which still sounds like a lot of money, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2746.2s)]
*  but it's considering the level of efforts needed for especially the weakest countries, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2750.6s)]
*  the countries, the low-lying countries, the countries that are disappearing actually [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2754.7599999999998s)]
*  with the rising sea levels. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2759.0s)]
*  It's a drop in the bucket, pardon the expression. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2760.44s)]
*  There's greater need for seriousness on climate diplomacy. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2763.32s)]
*  Brazil's going to be hosting the next COP. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2767.64s)]
*  You can count on Lula to give it a higher level of attention and ambition. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2769.72s)]
*  He's going to be hosting it in an Amazonian city. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2773.56s)]
*  We'll have to see whether that focuses attention globally. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2778.12s)]
*  You're not going to see a great deal of talk about climate change by all accounts [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2780.92s)]
*  from the incoming Trump administration, but as many people have pointed out, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2784.6s)]
*  the US actually isn't the greatest offender at this point in terms of emissions. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2788.12s)]
*  It's the rest of the world that needs to slow it down. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2792.2s)]
*  Yes, the US is responsible for pumping out an inordinate amount of emissions up to now, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2795.3199999999997s)]
*  but it is not producing the majority of that. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2800.12s)]
*  It's coming from other countries. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2802.6s)]
*  A lot of experts say it's really crucial to see what China does in terms of, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2804.04s)]
*  does China move more vigorously into renewables? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2809.0s)]
*  Does China set some sort of a tempo and change its own heavy emitting profile, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2812.2799999999997s)]
*  still building coal plants, for example? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2817.48s)]
*  Are we just going to continue in this race to greater warming and greater extreme weather events? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2820.2799999999997s)]
*  Sorry for the funk there, but I will say one more quick thing, which is, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2825.0s)]
*  those who like to view things hopefully and also realistically say that on the renewable front, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2829.96s)]
*  if there are dedicated steps towards moving towards renewable, including in the United States, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2836.52s)]
*  where that is possible and it's not all government driven, you could start to see some [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2841.64s)]
*  changing, some bending of the curves that we're seeing on emissions. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2845.8s)]
*  And technology is seen as a panacea increasingly, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2849.32s)]
*  but it involves humans driving that technology, not just AI. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2853.4s)]
*  And a lot of money. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2856.76s)]
*  And a lot of money. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2857.8s)]
*  Again, in the trillions with a T is the amount of money that's going to be needed. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2859.1600000000003s)]
*  And a lot of that, again, does not come from governments. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2862.6800000000003s)]
*  It comes from private sector, the so-called animal spirits that will potentially [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2864.76s)]
*  see it in their interest to pivot more vigorously from fossil fuels to renewables. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2869.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, that wraps up The World Next Year. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2874.84s)]
*  To all of our regular listeners, we hope you've enjoyed this special episode. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtomkWCcAPc&t=2878.2799999999997s)]
