# Rebels Gain In Myanmar, EU's Ukraine Aid Challenge, Kenya’s Pending Mission to Haiti, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE)
*  In the coming week, Myanmar marks three years under military junta rule, Ukraine seeks greater [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=0.0s)]
*  continued EU support, and Kenya's high court decides on whether a peacekeeping force can [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=6.16s)]
*  be sent to Haiti. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=11.0s)]
*  It's January 25, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=12.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=24.84s)]
*  So Bob, let's start with Myanmar. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  Next Thursday marks three years since the military junta seized complete power. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=33.24s)]
*  It wasn't like they were not pulling the strings from behind the scenes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=37.56s)]
*  This is a hugely repressive, even genocidal regime. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=42.4s)]
*  However, its control may be weakening. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=45.36s)]
*  Since last October, something called the Three Brotherhood Alliance, which is a coalition [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=47.42s)]
*  of three armed ethnic groups, has been attacking military bases, and they're gaining real [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=51.36s)]
*  territory. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=55.92s)]
*  Is the junta's days numbered? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=56.92s)]
*  Well, it would have been really far-fetched to even ask that question not too long ago, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=59.32s)]
*  Carla, but it is looking really bad for the junta for all sorts of reasons. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=63.92s)]
*  The first thing that should be said whenever you get into the thicket of Myanmar is it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=68.92s)]
*  is incredibly complicated. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=73.28s)]
*  It is an incredibly ethnically diverse country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=74.48s)]
*  It always astounds me when I start poking around in Myanmar just how diverse a country [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=76.56s)]
*  it is. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=80.72s)]
*  But the military has been this, for want of a better term, a glue for the country, or [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=81.88s)]
*  at least a force of some stability over the decades, despite the cost of that, which has [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  been, as you said, this repressive rule, not just recently, but over many years and many [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=92.84s)]
*  cycles. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  They are a particularly pernicious regime, and recently have lived up to that with reports [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  of torturing opposition opponents and demonstrators, even using snipers to pick off people demonstrating [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=103.76s)]
*  against them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  But they're a really challenge right now, and a big reason for that is what you referred [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=110.12s)]
*  is known as the Operation 1027 kicked off this latest round of attacks, and it's these [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  three ethnic armed groups focused in the northern state, the northern Shan state, which borders [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=120.8s)]
*  China. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  They attack military outposts. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  They were able to seize some towns. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=127.6s)]
*  They cut off important routes to China, and they are really sending a shutter through [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=129.48s)]
*  the military regime, and then combined with other armed ethnic groups that have formed [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=134.16s)]
*  a kind of a loose alliance. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=139.72s)]
*  It's not necessarily part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance, but they are, for one of a better [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=141.36s)]
*  term, brothers in arms against the military regime, and this includes members of the ethnic [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=145.76s)]
*  majority that are in opposition and a whole bunch of other ethnic groups that have been [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=151.32s)]
*  off and on at war with the military-led government for decades. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  And so the government forces are stretched thin. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=161.4s)]
*  They have high levels of attrition. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=164.12s)]
*  They are performing poorly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=165.68s)]
*  Their governance is frayed considerably, so that you're even seeing talk of almost a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=167.32s)]
*  failed state in the works. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  And one of their primary backers, and at least interlocutors over the years, has been China. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=173.4s)]
*  China seems to be playing different sides of the conflict at the moment, because they [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=178.76s)]
*  might be unsure about where this is all going. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=182.72s)]
*  So to answer your question, we could be seeing the early phases of the end of this particular [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=185.44s)]
*  military junta. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=189.6s)]
*  So this alliance, what is it they want? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=190.88s)]
*  I mean, are they breakaway? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=193.92s)]
*  Do they just want to control this province? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=195.88s)]
*  Is this all about ethnicity? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=198.6s)]
*  Or do they perhaps want to restore democracy? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  Certainly some of them would be content with their own bit of autonomy, but it's not like [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=205.24s)]
*  it's a movement to break up Myanmar into 30 different states. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  A number of them are united over the fact of a federalized Myanmar in terms of providing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=213.0s)]
*  a good amount of local control in a federal state and democratically elected and having [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=218.48s)]
*  some buy-in and having some say on how their own affairs are governed, as opposed to a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=223.98s)]
*  centrally imposed writ, and certainly a centrally imposed writ in which the ethnic majority [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=229.61999999999998s)]
*  is able to sometimes commit acts of atrocity against ethnic minorities. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=235.22s)]
*  And that's the case of what happened to the Rohingya recently, or in the not too recent [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=239.33999999999997s)]
*  past. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  So it does seem like, again, that there could be the early vestiges of a knitting together [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  of all these disparate groups into a different kind of Myanmar, but a lot has to happen still. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=250.62s)]
*  It's not going to be easy to completely topple the military regime. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=255.66000000000003s)]
*  And there's nothing to say that some of these groups might turn arms against each other. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=260.22s)]
*  However, some of the reporting coming out of the region, certainly the area of the Three [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=264.18s)]
*  Brotherhood Alliance, is that they would be trying to make common cause and willing to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=268.48s)]
*  make common cause, seemingly, with these democratic forces that are looking for a national unity [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=272.82s)]
*  government. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=277.68s)]
*  So for years and years, whenever we talked about politics inside of Myanmar, it was all [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=278.68s)]
*  about Aung San Suu Kyi and limited number of opposition leaders. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=283.16s)]
*  There's no identifiable opposition leader in this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=287.96s)]
*  It seems to have nothing to do with anything with democratic structures at all. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=291.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really good point. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=295.04s)]
*  I mean, there's a sort of a government in exile that speaks up. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=296.6s)]
*  Aung San Suu Kyi herself was the victim of the coup. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=300.24s)]
*  Her forces continually pull well whenever they hold anything close to regular elections. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  So there's a lot of opposition in Myanmar, but there's not that figure, that rallying [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=308.64s)]
*  figure, certainly an individual or even group of individuals at this point, which is why [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=314.16s)]
*  some experts have concern that if you do have, let's just say that central government falls [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=318.88s)]
*  or there's a further eroding of power, of central power in the country, it's not to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  say there could not be some sort of chaotic situation in which further bloodshed of a [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=329.36s)]
*  different sort happens. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=333.56s)]
*  So it's a perilous moment. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=334.56s)]
*  Many wishes that the military regime steps down or in some way seeds power, but it's [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=335.96s)]
*  also a pretty fraught moment. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  And I would just like to add for more on the sort of dynamics in Myanmar in this role about [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  what the rebels are looking for. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=347.38s)]
*  There's a new piece up on foreignaffairs.com by Avinash Palewal that really gets at a lot [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  of these issues. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=353.88s)]
*  So please check that out. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=354.88s)]
*  Well, Carla, like Myanmar, Ukraine is about to reach another grim milestone. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=355.88s)]
*  This is the mark up that started the third year since the Russian invasion of 2022. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  As this is being marked, additional U.S. aid, crucial U.S. aid, is stalled on Capitol Hill. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=366.14000000000004s)]
*  But there's also another major party, which is the European Union. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=371.14000000000004s)]
*  Next Thursday, European Union leaders are holding a special summit to discuss a new [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=373.94000000000005s)]
*  economic aid package. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  Previous package foundered because Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban refused to consider [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=384.70000000000005s)]
*  And so they are dialing this back up on the calendar for February 1st. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=385.70000000000005s)]
*  What should we expect from this meeting? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=389.52s)]
*  Are we going to see a change in the Orban approach to this? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  The Orban hostage-taking, which seems to never end. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  So let's start this. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=398.88s)]
*  This is really a nerve-wracking tale. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  And let's start it back in Washington. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=402.28s)]
*  On Tuesday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hosted his monthly meeting with representatives [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=404.44s)]
*  of dozens of the countries that provide military support to Ukraine. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  And at this meeting, U.S. officials were really blunt. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  They said the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition on the front and that the U.S. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=416.52s)]
*  Cup route is bare and it's going to stay that way unless Congress gets its act together. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=420.96s)]
*  And it looked like Congress might, that the Senate at least, might get its act together. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=425.84s)]
*  But the news on this is pretty awful because now former President Trump is weighing in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=429.84s)]
*  and he's pressing senators to not move ahead with the deal because he apparently doesn't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=434.2s)]
*  want to deal on immigration because he's going to campaign on it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=438.91999999999996s)]
*  And even Senator McConnell, who was a big supporter of aid for Ukraine, seems to be [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=441.82s)]
*  backing away for the sake of the, quote, nominee. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=446.62s)]
*  Of course, in the House, the hardliners appear to be completely dug in. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=449.02s)]
*  So it doesn't look great there. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=452.5s)]
*  So all this puts an even greater premium on the EU to step up. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  And the Europeans have their own politics to contend with. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=458.74s)]
*  And much of what the EU does requires consensus, as you know. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=461.38s)]
*  And Viktor Orban is an unabashed Putin backer. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=465.5s)]
*  He's been holding the alliance hostage ever since the war began. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=468.5s)]
*  In December, to get Orban to agree to opening EU accession talks with Ukraine, the Commission [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=472.53999999999996s)]
*  unfroze more than $10 billion worth of euro payments to Hungary, which had been suspended [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=477.5s)]
*  because of Orban's utterly horrible civil liberties track record. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  And even to get that happened, Orban left the room. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=487.7s)]
*  There's lots of, did he go to the loo? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=490.9s)]
*  Did he go on a coffee break? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=493.09999999999997s)]
*  It was a face-saving issue. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=495.17999999999995s)]
*  It was a very convenient departure. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=496.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=497.86s)]
*  But he blocked this $50-plus billion worth of economic aid then. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=498.86s)]
*  So now they're going to revisit it next week on the 1st. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=504.5s)]
*  And it's not the only issue. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=508.02s)]
*  They have several issues to wrestle with. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=509.1s)]
*  First of all is this four-year $50 billion economic aid package that Hungary blocked [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=511.48s)]
*  in December. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=515.9s)]
*  Then there's a discussion about a new $22 billion Ukraine military fund that would use [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=517.3s)]
*  EU funds to reimburse countries for some of the military assistance they give to Ukraine [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=521.98s)]
*  while encouraging more joint military production and procurement, which seems pretty important. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=526.58s)]
*  And then there's also going to be a discussion, but likely no resolution, of the issue of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=531.9s)]
*  whether to use frozen Russian assets. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=535.26s)]
*  There are $300 billion just from the Russian central bank out there. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=537.74s)]
*  Or more likely, the earnings from those assets to help finance Ukraine's war efforts. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=541.78s)]
*  So there's a lot of things to be discussed here having to do with Ukraine. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=545.64s)]
*  And all of them require consensus decision. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=549.16s)]
*  So they're going to need Orban's sign off. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=552.36s)]
*  He has been sending mixed signals. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=555.8s)]
*  Nobody knows what his price is. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=558.16s)]
*  And there are a growing number of people who were saying, how do we do an end run to run [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  Orban? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  The members of the parliament were talking about what can we do to suspend his voting [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  rights. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=569.36s)]
*  People are really fed up with him. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=570.36s)]
*  If I had to bet in this game of chicken, there's going to be another payoff to Orban in the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=571.68s)]
*  end. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=576.16s)]
*  And they used to be what had been dangled out there was pretty effective leverage against [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=577.16s)]
*  Orban, which was the unfreezing suspended aid, for example, that had been suspended [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=581.28s)]
*  because of governance issues or things that Hungary had violated under EU terms. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=586.68s)]
*  Is that the type of thing that we should expect to happen? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=592.8399999999999s)]
*  Are there any other major champions of Ukraine ready to speak up and sort of move this process? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=594.92s)]
*  Well, that's what they did in part to get the accession talks to move forward. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=599.4s)]
*  But there are also people who are really furious about that because he hasn't improved his [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=605.4s)]
*  track record. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=609.76s)]
*  And there are members of the parliament who are saying they want to move forward once [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=610.76s)]
*  again with this Article 7 denying him his voting rights. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=614.52s)]
*  The Slovaks are saying they're going to protect him on it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=618.16s)]
*  These rules make it almost impossible in the EU to punish anybody, particularly if you [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=620.84s)]
*  have another friend to protect you. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=624.84s)]
*  Look like Poland was no longer going to protect Hungary and then the Slovaks came along. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=627.4399999999999s)]
*  It's really hard in the EU to punish anybody, which makes them even more problematic. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=631.64s)]
*  So people are questioning the rules, questioning the payoff issue and knowing the desperation [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=640.72s)]
*  They're probably going to talk about what the price is and what other way they can pay [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=641.72s)]
*  off Orban. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=645.1s)]
*  But it's pretty grim, but comparably grim in Washington. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=646.56s)]
*  But the Europeans seem more determined to move forward than we seem able to move forward [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=650.18s)]
*  right now. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=654.08s)]
*  And there's also the late great EU member, the United Kingdom, that has continued to [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=655.08s)]
*  show its interest in supporting Ukraine. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=660.52s)]
*  Can they bring any kind of meaningful assistance or it really has to be in tandem with other [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=662.24s)]
*  European partners? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=665.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, they're certainly committed and they've been making very strong statements [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=666.52s)]
*  and it seems less politically fraught in Britain than it is in the United States, certainly. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  And in Europe, it doesn't seem particularly politically fraught for most of these countries. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=679.28s)]
*  They seem to get it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=683.0s)]
*  It seems to be really a problem of just a few countries. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=684.0s)]
*  When you compare the numbers, the numbers are small. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=687.9599999999999s)]
*  Twenty two billion dollars. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=690.88s)]
*  When we're looking about 60 billion would be the commitment if this could get through [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=692.72s)]
*  on the Hill and this is 22 billion dollars over several years. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=697.76s)]
*  The numbers are just a lot smaller from Europe. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=702.12s)]
*  And again, this is mostly softer, so-called softer aid or an economic aid focus and not [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=705.16s)]
*  military armament. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=709.92s)]
*  No, the 50 billion would be economic aid. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=710.92s)]
*  Now money is fungible. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=713.04s)]
*  And certainly they don't want the Ukrainians printing money because the last thing they [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=715.76s)]
*  need is even more economic instability there and financial instability there. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=720.8s)]
*  The 22 billion is to make up for and to move forward to replenish stocks in countries that [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=725.64s)]
*  are already providing aid and also to move forward European defense industry so that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  they can fill in gaps and do joint procurement, addressing lots of problems there. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=736.08s)]
*  But the scale of this by comparison, the US has been the main contributor on the military [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=740.68s)]
*  front and rallies it forward, which is what made this meeting with Austin so grim in which [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=745.68s)]
*  they said two things. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  One is at the front, they're running out of ammunition and our cupboard is bare because [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=752.52s)]
*  of American politics. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=758.12s)]
*  So you've got Orban, they're tied up and not because of just the rules of the EU and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=759.66s)]
*  we're tied up and not here because of the dysfunction of American politics. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=765.2399999999999s)]
*  And the Ukrainians are tearing their hair out, not surprisingly. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=769.5999999999999s)]
*  And back on the front lines, you've got the stalemate where it seemed to be in a little [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=772.36s)]
*  bit of a lull at the moment, but Russians are dug in and almost 20% of Ukrainian territory [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=776.4s)]
*  they occupy occasionally launching really devastating attacks on civilian targets and [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=780.44s)]
*  infrastructure and so forth. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=786.76s)]
*  So Ukraine would obviously could really use this support and also some sort of sense of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=788.0s)]
*  momentum going into the spring where one assumes they'll be ratcheting up and fighting. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=792.44s)]
*  So Bob, let's pivot to Haiti where chaos has reigned since July of 21 when President [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=798.6s)]
*  Jovenel Moise was assassinated. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=804.0s)]
*  Some 80% of Port-au-Prince, the capital is under gang control and the Haitians have been [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=806.88s)]
*  pleading for outside help to restore order, but no one has been willing to come in and [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=811.08s)]
*  bell the cat. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=815.0400000000001s)]
*  Now Kenya's president, William Ruto, has proposed that his country will lead a multinational [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  peacekeeping force to Haiti. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=820.96s)]
*  And this Friday, we're taping on Thursday, Kenya's high court is going to decide if it [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=823.38s)]
*  is constitutional to send this force. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=828.08s)]
*  Kenya's received a lot of international praise as well as economic support from the U.S. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=831.12s)]
*  for its proposal and Haiti's in dire need of help. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=835.5600000000001s)]
*  So why is there any legal question about this? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=839.88s)]
*  Well, I should also note in terms of things happening on the ground that as we're taping [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  this podcast, the UN Security Council is supposedly meeting to talk about the broader scope of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  the UN mission in Haiti of supporting what's known as the multinational security support [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=852.76s)]
*  mission. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=857.24s)]
*  And they're really keen on Kenya coming up with this support, even though, as is widely [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=858.24s)]
*  acknowledged, it's a bit of a drop in the bucket, but it is something. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=862.56s)]
*  It is some sort of an international gesture to pacify a situation and with gang situation [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=866.6s)]
*  is getting truly alarming. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=871.4s)]
*  Now Kenya, though, it must be noted, it's certainly been controversial as a proposal. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=873.4s)]
*  You have some opposition politicians, including the ones who brought this to the court, basically [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=878.2s)]
*  saying we've got a lot of problems of our own here, including even problems of insecurity. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=882.84s)]
*  Why are we sending an expedition halfway around the world to get involved in this adventure [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=888.2s)]
*  where we've seen time after time failure happen? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=892.52s)]
*  So this Kenyan debate has ended up in this court hearing. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=896.6800000000001s)]
*  It's expected that regardless of how the court rules tomorrow, 26th of January, it's going [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=900.0400000000001s)]
*  to be challenged, which will then further delay it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=905.64s)]
*  The Kenyan government and the parliament, which have approved this, had wanted to get [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=908.52s)]
*  first batch of these soldiers, several hundred, over to Haiti as early as February. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=911.64s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's going to happen now, Carla, and Haiti cannot really bear too much [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=916.76s)]
*  else on this front. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=921.0s)]
*  We've talked about before, not only is it just a terrible situation domestically, but [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=922.36s)]
*  you cannot ignore what it means regionally. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=927.16s)]
*  Haitians who have any means at all or any sort of path at all are pouring out of the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=929.72s)]
*  country. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=933.24s)]
*  A lot of them are going through this perilous passageway known as the Darien Gap to get [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=933.96s)]
*  into Central America, to start a path to get to the US border. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=938.04s)]
*  You're seeing increasing numbers of Haitians trying to declare for asylum. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=941.16s)]
*  So there is a through line between what happens in Haiti and in its increasingly vulnerable [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=945.16s)]
*  state and what it means for other countries, including the United States. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=950.4399999999999s)]
*  The Security Council will, again, will discuss this mission, but also the broader political [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=954.12s)]
*  spectrum of Haiti, which includes a looming deadline to provide a plan for a political [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=959.3199999999999s)]
*  transition. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=964.6s)]
*  There is a lot of domestic unrest aside from the gang issue, but the gangs are stepping [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=965.64s)]
*  into this growing vacuum and it just gets worse and worse in Haiti. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=970.6s)]
*  Danielle Pletka I know you're not a constitutional scholar [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=974.0400000000001s)]
*  for Kenya. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=977.24s)]
*  Michael Svigel I am not. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=977.88s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Much to the disappointment of your mother, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=978.76s)]
*  I'm sure, who wanted you to go to law school to study Kenyan law. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=981.0s)]
*  But do we understand why this is even in the court? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=984.2s)]
*  Because you've got the president who committed to doing this and the parliament that approved [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=988.0400000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=994.28s)]
*  So do we understand the legal issue here? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=995.24s)]
*  Michael Svigel Well, you raise a good point because the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=997.88s)]
*  officials who want to make this happen, including the president, are saying the court doesn't [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=999.8s)]
*  have the right to step in here. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1004.12s)]
*  And in fact, we are allowed to, in our purview, to be able to assign such a mission. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1005.24s)]
*  And that actually could become an issue too. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1011.16s)]
*  We should keep our eye on that, whether or not they go ahead and just say, sorry, high [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1012.76s)]
*  court, but we're going to go ahead with this. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1017.16s)]
*  That, again, has unknown ramifications in Kenyan domestic discourse. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1019.0799999999999s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1023.64s)]
*  And it will be interesting to see whether the high court tries to finesse this or not, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1025.0s)]
*  or whether, again, if it does approve and say the government does have the right, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1028.28s)]
*  then how much of a pushback is there? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1032.6s)]
*  How much does this, do things get gummed up further there? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1034.6799999999998s)]
*  And whether the Kenyan part of this whole piece, you know, further, you know, just delays [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1038.6s)]
*  any sort of sense of movement on Haiti. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1042.52s)]
*  But it is a question that seems to be a little bit up in the air constitutionally. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1044.6799999999998s)]
*  I should note our colleague Ebenezer Obadare has posted on the CFR blog, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1049.08s)]
*  Africa Unbound, about this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1053.0s)]
*  You know, even whether it goes ahead, it's very dubious about what it's going to accomplish. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1054.6s)]
*  The Kenyan mission seems to be particularly ill-suited to the environment in Haiti. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1060.12s)]
*  The Kenyan peacekeepers have no training in a Haitian context, nor do the handful of Caribbean [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1065.48s)]
*  nations who have decided they were going to sign up to this. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1071.56s)]
*  None of them have, for example, the ability to speak French or Creole, to communicate [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1073.64s)]
*  with Haitians and understand the context there. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1078.52s)]
*  The gangs have the ability to just sort of melt away into the slums where many of them [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1080.84s)]
*  operate heavily armed. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1084.92s)]
*  And by the way, many of their arms come from the United States. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1086.44s)]
*  So it was a question of, you know, is that an avenue in which there can be some pressure [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1089.24s)]
*  brought to bear? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1092.92s)]
*  It seems like U.S. gun supplies have contributed to some instability in the region as well. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1093.48s)]
*  Are they really heavily armed? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1098.6s)]
*  They are loaded. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1100.04s)]
*  They are loaded for bear, which is why this astounding figure of how much they control [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1100.84s)]
*  in the capital and all the kidnappings. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1103.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's just staggering. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm getting into a whole set of other issues, Carla, but, you know, I think it [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1107.64s)]
*  starts with a true sense that Kenya wanted to try to participate in this and be part [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1112.0400000000002s)]
*  of something bigger. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1117.16s)]
*  And it is really fraught. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1118.5200000000002s)]
*  And part of it is that Haiti has this sense of defying international efforts to bring [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1119.88s)]
*  it under control. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1125.96s)]
*  I should add as a final footnote, Haiti itself has had incredibly tough time over the years [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1126.8400000000001s)]
*  with international expeditions. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1132.68s)]
*  Peacekeepers have been found of committing sexual abuse, for example. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1134.92s)]
*  Other UN missions have been found to contribute to the spread of cholera in Haiti. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1138.28s)]
*  And at the same time, without the UN, it's hard to imagine any sort of society even existing [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1143.3200000000002s)]
*  in Haiti. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1148.6000000000001s)]
*  And it should be noted when Haiti suffered its devastating earthquake more than a dozen [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1149.24s)]
*  years ago, the UN suffered heavily, including the leader of its mission, a high ranking [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1152.68s)]
*  UN political official dying in the earthquake. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1157.8000000000002s)]
*  It's all the way around. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1160.04s)]
*  Haiti is just a really, really tough problem to solve. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1161.16s)]
*  Yes, it is a constant tragedy, an ecological and human tragedy. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1165.24s)]
*  Well, Carla, if that wasn't enough, we've talked our way into the audience figure of [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1171.3200000000002s)]
*  the week portion of the podcast. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1175.16s)]
*  This is the figure in which listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1178.76s)]
*  org's Instagram story. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1183.24s)]
*  This week, Carla, our audience selected 1 million plus protest right wing parties in Germany. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1184.8400000000001s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1190.68s)]
*  Well, this is actually something of a good news story. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1192.3600000000001s)]
*  Germans have been rightly nervous about the rise of far right party AFD, the alternative [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1195.8000000000002s)]
*  for Germany. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1201.0800000000002s)]
*  This was originally founded as a Euro skeptic party more than a decade ago, and it won 10.3% [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1202.52s)]
*  of the vote in 2021 federal elections. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1209.16s)]
*  And it's now polling in second place nationally with around 23%. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1212.44s)]
*  And given Germany's history, that's pretty chilling. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1216.2800000000002s)]
*  But the most immediate cause for these demonstrations, which really are the largest [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1220.2s)]
*  in recent history, was a report from a media outlet called Corrective, which last week [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1223.64s)]
*  reported on an alleged far right meeting way back in November, which included representatives [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1229.96s)]
*  from the AFD and from an extremist identitarian movement, which discussed mass deportation of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1234.52s)]
*  migrants, asylum seekers, and German citizens of foreign origin deemed to, quote, have failed [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1241.72s)]
*  to integrate. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1247.4s)]
*  So pretty creepy discussion and really scared the pants off of people. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1249.24s)]
*  But the remarkable thing is when you consider polling at 23%, you had hundreds of thousands [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1255.8799999999999s)]
*  of people coming out in the streets in Germany saying no to Nazism, no to this past, and [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1263.0s)]
*  never again. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1268.44s)]
*  Germans standing up and saying, we've seen this before and we don't want it. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1269.8799999999999s)]
*  No, it's worth noting that Germany has really stood out in its efforts, and I saw this first [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1274.04s)]
*  hand when I lived there in the 90s, to reconcile with its past, to hold painful discussions [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1279.6399999999999s)]
*  about the Holocaust, about the role of Nazi Germany. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1285.0s)]
*  I lived in Munich at a time when the main Munich local museum had an exhibit about Munich's [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1288.52s)]
*  role as the capital of the Nazi movement. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1294.68s)]
*  And they had incredible artifacts they were able to bring out and show in this exhibit [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1297.24s)]
*  about just where the early marches were when Hitler rose to power and so forth. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1301.4s)]
*  And it was painful. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1305.5600000000002s)]
*  And I saw arguments breaking out in the museum amongst Germans and so forth. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1306.2800000000002s)]
*  But the fact is they did it. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1309.72s)]
*  And I think many other countries have ignored this. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1311.3200000000002s)]
*  Even US allies like Japan have not reconciled with their past in the World War II era and the [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1313.5600000000002s)]
*  past abuses in this way. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1319.0s)]
*  Certainly Russia hasn't. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1320.76s)]
*  And so it doesn't surprise me that this turnout happened and where it happened in Germany. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1322.2s)]
*  You're even seeing calls by some German politicians to ban the AfD. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1326.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure they have the ability to do that, but it's being raised by prominent politicians. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1330.2s)]
*  So we're seeing a very interesting debate play out in Germany that could have repercussions [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1334.68s)]
*  in other parts of Europe. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1338.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, one of the things also that we as Americans should find chilling is a lot of this discussion [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1340.6000000000001s)]
*  is based on this notion of the Great Replacement Theory, which has considerable resonance among [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1345.72s)]
*  parts of the Republican Party here in the United States. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1353.0800000000002s)]
*  And certainly immigration and this notion of mass deportation is going to be part of the [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1355.56s)]
*  political debate in our own presidential campaign. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1363.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not comparing our own political parties to the AfD, but anti-migrant posturing is a [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1366.12s)]
*  pretty strong through line in a lot of political debates around the world and also in our own [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1374.76s)]
*  country. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1381.24s)]
*  And so I think we all have to be very vigilant about this sort of veering off into some very [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnmKO18HqSE&t=1382.04s)]
