# World Press Freedom Day 2024 Mounting Threats, Renewed Purpose
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y)
*  Welcome to the World Next Week special Press Freedom episode. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=6.72s)]
*  And I'm Karl Anne Robbins. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=7.72s)]
*  And I'm Jeff Kettman. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=10.92s)]
*  Joining us for this special episode is a fantastic writer, editor, champion of free press, and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=23.72s)]
*  in full disclosure, a really good friend, Jeff Kettman. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=28.56s)]
*  Jeff is the co-founder and editor-in-chief of American Purpose. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=31.68s)]
*  He's twice led Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, of which Bob is a proud alum. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=34.48s)]
*  Jeff finished up his most recent stint at RFE RL just a few months ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=39.54s)]
*  So a lot to talk about that work in these dangerous times. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=43.66s)]
*  Jeff is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=46.68s)]
*  Jeff, welcome to our show. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Carla and Bob, thank you very much for having me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=51.2s)]
*  Well Carla and Jeff, tomorrow is World Press Freedom Day, or maybe we should call it World [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Media Freedom Day. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  The day is dedicated to the importance of journalism and freedom of expression. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  This year so far has been especially hard for journalists. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=63.72s)]
*  It's basically part of a decade-long plus period of difficulties. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=66.72s)]
*  Just for one set of examples, Reporters Without Borders, a watchdog group has found that the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  environment for journalism is bad in seven out of ten countries. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=75.64s)]
*  Another watchdog group, Freedom House, has been citing the decline in press freedom as [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  part of an overall erosion, or shall we say a recession in democracy over the past 15 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=84.58s)]
*  or 16 years. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=89.9s)]
*  Obstacles to journalism and the free flow of information range from censorship to violent [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=91.74s)]
*  attacks and actually targets and assassinations of journalists. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=96.42s)]
*  So there's no better time than today as we celebrate the power of the pen, or perhaps [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=101.34s)]
*  the podcast, to reflect on where global press freedom stands. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=105.74s)]
*  So Bob, as you said, this has been an incredibly tough year. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=110.0s)]
*  Myanmar, Iran, Russia, governments have been shutting news outlets, harassing, jailing, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=113.12s)]
*  killing reporters, editors, photographers. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=117.6s)]
*  A large number of people have been forced to flee their home countries. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=120.32s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about when journalists decide they have no choice but to leave. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=123.88s)]
*  Are they still managing to do their work of speaking truth to power? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=127.52s)]
*  And are they even safe once they cross the border, or do the threats and the harassment [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=131.4s)]
*  continue? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=135.4s)]
*  Well, this is a growing phenomenon, Carla, which is the journalists in exile phenomenon. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=136.68s)]
*  The group I cited earlier, Reporters Without Borders, said just last year alone it provided [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=142.28s)]
*  about 460 journalists from 62 countries with financial assistance in relocation or resettlement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=147.56s)]
*  And that's twice the number that they helped the previous year. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  So there's a trend right there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=157.88s)]
*  You could probably guess some of the countries these journalists were exiled from. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=159.56s)]
*  Russia, certainly, Myanmar, Iran, Afghanistan, just to name a few. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=163.32s)]
*  And through these help organizations, and there's many others, and it's sometimes governments [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  too, by the way, journalists are being given some means to relocate, sometimes with family [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=174.0s)]
*  members or close family members. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=179.76s)]
*  They can set up shop. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=181.44s)]
*  But it's usually a kind of a temporary period of time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=183.04s)]
*  Some are sort of in transit and in many cases, unfortunately, have targets on their backs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=185.74s)]
*  We've seen Russia in particular go after journalists seeking to report the truth about its invasion [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=191.72s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=197.72s)]
*  There was not many independent or open media in Russia at the time of that invasion, 2022. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=198.72s)]
*  And it certainly just really put down the hammer after that date. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=205.6s)]
*  And anybody referring to it even as a war is subject to harsh penalties. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=210.0s)]
*  Jeff knows this very well, obviously, from his work recently stewarding Radio Free, Orb [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=214.44s)]
*  Radio Liberty. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=218.08s)]
*  The Russian tactics include intimidation, include outright attempts at violence, poisoning [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=220.0s)]
*  is a favored tactic and so forth. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=225.16s)]
*  But again, we're seeing it with journalists leaving Myanmar, which is one of the undercover [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=227.68s)]
*  stories of the year, a terrible situation there, multiple battles going on in a civil [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  war there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=236.08s)]
*  Some of those journalists have been able to relocate to Thailand, for example. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=237.24s)]
*  We're seeing it in Hong Kong. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=240.88s)]
*  Jimmy Lai is in a prison and facing very harsh penalties there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=242.28s)]
*  The national security law that China is pressing forward with is quashing the last sort of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=247.0s)]
*  free voices in Hong Kong. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=252.76s)]
*  Some of those journalists and others are going to Singapore, among other places, and we can [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=254.8s)]
*  go on and on. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=258.96s)]
*  So it's a problem of not only relocating journalists whose media organizations have basically been [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=260.04s)]
*  snuffed out or sometimes they're able to port over the semblance of their media organization, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=266.4s)]
*  but then it's supporting them and protecting them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=271.72s)]
*  It just speaks to a very chilling period right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=274.88000000000005s)]
*  I will say that, again, evoking some of Jeff's recent work, that you have organizations like [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=277.72s)]
*  the so-called surrogates of Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, are able to support and hire [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=283.0s)]
*  some of these journalists to do their work in providing this surrogate service. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  But it's a work that requires more massive resources to try to replicate in any way what [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=292.04s)]
*  kind of work they were doing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  We talk a lot about journalistic deserts in this country, United States, but we're talking [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  about whole countries that are becoming deserts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=303.08s)]
*  I mean, let's just look at the vastness of Russia and how little covered that is right [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=304.68s)]
*  now and the dangers that those who still try to cover Russia, even from abroad, are facing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=308.56s)]
*  Jeff, your people obviously face incredible dangers when they go work inside countries, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=314.32s)]
*  when they're abroad. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=321.44s)]
*  What sort of tales do they tell you about the harassment that they get even outside [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=323.12s)]
*  their original home countries? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=327.28s)]
*  So, Carla, I'm very happy to be with you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  I admire your work and Bob's greatly. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=332.52s)]
*  You're both friends. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  And the subject can only make one pensive because, as Bob noted, we're all concerned [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  about individual cases and protecting people. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=341.28s)]
*  And when they're in prison, obtain their release. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=344.56s)]
*  But this is a trend as press freedom declines, it's in sync with democracy faltering and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=347.96s)]
*  authoritarianism rising. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=356.64s)]
*  Carla, from a RFERL, Radio Free, Radio Liberty perspective, the governments of our broadcast [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=360.0s)]
*  region are becoming increasingly repressive at home, increasingly brazen, and they're [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=367.44s)]
*  different. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=373.88s)]
*  But Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Belarus, Russia, Bob mentioned several times. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=374.88s)]
*  What kind of tales, what kind of illustrations? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=381.44s)]
*  Just a quick few points. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=384.24s)]
*  Number one, many, to another point that Bob made, many of these journalists, especially [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=386.56s)]
*  the younger ones who live outside of Russia, principally in Europe and Prague and Riga [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=391.8s)]
*  elsewhere, working for RFERL but for others, this is my speculation, they came to work [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  abroad as journalists because it was more efficient, effective, and safer. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=404.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think now they start to contemplate, imagine you're 25, 30, 33, 37, I'm beginning [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=410.04s)]
*  a life in exile. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=417.0s)]
*  I may not go home. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  Not anytime soon. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=421.48s)]
*  And now my family and friends are in jeopardy because of what I do outside of Russia and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=423.24s)]
*  Europe. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=428.48s)]
*  I think that's one thing to note. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=429.48s)]
*  The second thing, directly to respond to your question, Carla, all these regimes have different [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=430.48s)]
*  techniques and methods. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  And they harass at home. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=438.12s)]
*  They reach out abroad, poisoning, intimidating, surveilling, harassing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=439.52s)]
*  But it can be soft to harder. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=444.64s)]
*  And I'll give you two. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=446.64s)]
*  A popular technique, if I may put it that way, of the Iranian government is to issue [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=447.88s)]
*  a summons for journalists working abroad to return home to face, well, to present themselves [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=453.84s)]
*  before an Iranian court. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, when that journalist says, well, no, I'm not doing that, that certain arrest [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  and imprisonment, then the next round can be, well, we will then knock on your mother's [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=466.52s)]
*  door and her deed to her home in Northern Tehran is in jeopardy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=472.0s)]
*  Then would you like to come home? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=476.4s)]
*  People get faced with dilemma after dilemma after dilemma. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=477.96s)]
*  And of course, in the case of Russia, but not only, I think the communication has been [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=480.84s)]
*  if we can't shut you down at home, if we can't get you at home, we will reach you [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=486.24s)]
*  abroad. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=491.08s)]
*  And there are two threats, intimidation, surveillance, and poisoning. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=492.56s)]
*  And I'll just tell you, we had a case at RFRL during my recent tenure in the fall, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=497.56s)]
*  not ancient history, in the fall, where a 35-year-old senior video producer collapsed [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=503.64s)]
*  at home on a weekend, was put in a medically induced coma, and died shortly thereafter. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=512.24s)]
*  There was a homicide investigation. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=520.24s)]
*  There was no evidence of wrongdoing, but there was no evidence of anything. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=522.88s)]
*  And there was an autopsy, and that remains closed. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=527.96s)]
*  So that doesn't mean you know anything. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=531.48s)]
*  It means you speculate and you wonder. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  And journalists, active journalists are concerned. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  So I think it's tightening. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=539.0s)]
*  Virtually everywhere it's tightening, and the regimes are very inventive at home and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=541.48s)]
*  abroad on how they silence people. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=545.52s)]
*  I think it's interesting that just the exiling or the active exile of a journalist does not [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=549.2199999999999s)]
*  mean that that journalist's voice is silent and that the power of media is silent. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=555.4599999999999s)]
*  It just shows how important it is because these regimes do feel so threatened. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=559.3399999999999s)]
*  Another case we should really mention, unfortunately there are very many examples, is of course [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=565.14s)]
*  the Saudis going after Jamal Khashoggi when he entered into a consulate in Istanbul thinking [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=568.38s)]
*  he was safe. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  I think there's this sense of, you know, that in some cases journalists who are abroad might [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=574.46s)]
*  feel a little bit more sense of protection or safety, and they're seeing increasingly [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=579.42s)]
*  that's not the case. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=584.06s)]
*  And it's also, I would just add one more thing, Jeff, if you had any thoughts or Carla, it's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=585.62s)]
*  almost becoming a tech race as well with the advent of the Pegasus spyware. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=589.7s)]
*  You know, journalists have been happy to have these tools to use to do their investigative [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=594.38s)]
*  work, but we're finding regimes are just as capable. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=598.74s)]
*  The technology sort of goes two ways because we also are getting pretty extraordinary reporting [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=602.0600000000001s)]
*  from lots of reporters who have left Russia and left a lot of these other countries, and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=607.46s)]
*  not just people who go work for RFE-URL, but people who work for some of these organizations [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=613.5400000000001s)]
*  that were shut down inside of Russia, but people who continue to report because they [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=618.7800000000001s)]
*  have technology, because they can tell us what's going on inside. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=623.0600000000001s)]
*  And so the technology is bridging the gap to a certain extent. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=627.4200000000001s)]
*  Yes, they can be spied upon, but they've showed incredible courage and incredible [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=630.9s)]
*  ability to use the technology to continue to, because we are platform agnostic these [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=634.54s)]
*  days, because people can communicate in many different ways. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=638.98s)]
*  And that's the, I don't mean to be Pollyanna sheer, but there's something of a good story [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=641.78s)]
*  on tech as well, Bob. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=645.5799999999999s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=647.1s)]
*  And it's something that we're going to have to keep on watching. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=648.1s)]
*  There's a little bit of a cat and mouse game going on in places like China with people [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=650.4599999999999s)]
*  using VPNs and so forth and telegram accounts. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=653.78s)]
*  But yes, there is a little bit of hope as well, because the press and the urgency and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  the desire for freedom is a compelling one that should not be underrated. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=662.4599999999999s)]
*  Jeff, I wanted to follow up on this vein though, and talk to you about a case that has very [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=666.4599999999999s)]
*  much gripped the RFE-URL community and maybe not has generated as much notoriety and a [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=671.5s)]
*  profile abroad, although I think it's getting there, which is the case of an RFE-URL journalist, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=677.66s)]
*  colleague of yours, on a case we followed on this podcast. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=681.5s)]
*  Her name is Alsu Kermasheva. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=684.86s)]
*  She's a Russian-American journalist who was first stopped by Russian authorities when [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=686.62s)]
*  she was making a visit to Kazan last June for a family emergency. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=690.94s)]
*  And then that followed up months later in October with her being detained and formally [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=695.5400000000001s)]
*  charged and she's being accused of not registering herself as a quote unquote foreign agent. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=699.5s)]
*  She's facing at least five years in prison or as many as five years in prison. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=704.5s)]
*  Could you tell us, Jeff, what you know about the latest on this case and what kind of signaling [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=709.26s)]
*  this has sent to the practice of American or other journalists in Russia? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=713.42s)]
*  So thank you, Bob. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=718.54s)]
*  And I'm a fan of this podcast. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=719.5799999999999s)]
*  That's why I'm honored to be with you. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=721.5799999999999s)]
*  And I listened to that particular episode and you two were exceptionally well informed. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=722.9799999999999s)]
*  And thank you for that. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=728.9799999999999s)]
*  So indeed, Alsu Kermasheva is a RFE-URL culture reporter. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=730.54s)]
*  And her work was focused on culture, ethnicity issues, minority rights in the Republic of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=736.86s)]
*  Tatarstan, the capital Kazan, 500 miles east of Moscow. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=745.0600000000001s)]
*  You started us off well, Bob, by noting that she was first stopped from leaving the country [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=750.1s)]
*  in June. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=756.22s)]
*  She went on a private trip, by the way, to visit her elderly, frail mother. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=756.74s)]
*  No reporting, purely private and understandable. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=762.14s)]
*  She was stopped. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=766.78s)]
*  She came into a de facto kind of house arrest until October when she was arrested, if I [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=768.14s)]
*  may say, in most brazen fashion. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=775.02s)]
*  That was men in ski masks coming to her mother's home, cuffing this woman, hauling her off [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=777.54s)]
*  for interrogation. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=785.26s)]
*  So there's also taken off to interrogation. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=787.26s)]
*  And Bob, in short, the allegations keep evolving. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=791.06s)]
*  It started with she's a US-Russian dual national. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=795.26s)]
*  The first was she failed to disclose her US citizenship. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=798.98s)]
*  And then the second was it just kept morphing, failure to self-register as a foreign agent, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=802.86s)]
*  as you said. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=808.54s)]
*  Now she's still there in a unpleasant, overcrowded cell. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=809.5s)]
*  They are preparing, we think it is said, a case against her for spreading false information [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=814.58s)]
*  about the Russian military. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=821.78s)]
*  That could be 15 years. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=823.42s)]
*  She's just had her pretrial detention extended to June 5. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=825.6999999999999s)]
*  It used to be, and mostly is, governments, authoritarian governments, do this to silence [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=831.5799999999999s)]
*  people, to elude accountability, to repress people, to constrain individual freedom and [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=837.26s)]
*  liberty. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=842.9s)]
*  But in this particular case, the case of Vladimir Putin and Russia and also, it seems, Bob and [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=843.9s)]
*  Carla, it's a bit of a hostage-taking spree, too. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=850.8199999999999s)]
*  If you look back, Brittany Greiner, she got out. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=854.6999999999999s)]
*  Paul Whelan, he is not out. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=857.86s)]
*  Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal, he is not out. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=859.66s)]
*  There's a teacher, a history teacher named Mark Fogel. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=862.6999999999999s)]
*  He is not out. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=865.1s)]
*  There's a dual national from California named Ksenia, who ill-advisedly, in January, went [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=866.1s)]
*  home to visit her grandparents, whom she had not seen before the pandemic. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=871.5s)]
*  She's in, she's not out. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=875.18s)]
*  So it's certainly chilling, it's repression, but it seems also in the case of Vladimir [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=876.74s)]
*  Putin and Russia, he's taking hostages as trade bait. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=882.1s)]
*  Jeff, is the US government giving her case the attention and the support that it needs? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=886.02s)]
*  Carla, thank you for asking. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=892.78s)]
*  There is attention and there is support, and we're grateful for that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=895.0600000000001s)]
*  And there is a designation called unlawfully detained. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=900.02s)]
*  Paul Whelan has that. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=904.86s)]
*  He should. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=906.52s)]
*  Evan Gershkovich has that, and he should. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=907.52s)]
*  And we believe that also deserves that too. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=910.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=913.96s)]
*  It frees up additional resources and makes her officially a case for hostage affairs. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=914.96s)]
*  And while I can't prove this to you, I think it makes it more likely that she will get [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=920.76s)]
*  into the front of a queue for a hostage or a prisoner swap. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=925.84s)]
*  There are criteria, according to something called the Levinson Act, a leaven that one [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=929.84s)]
*  must meet to qualify for this designation. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=935.3s)]
*  It's not a magic wand, it just helps unlock additional resources. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=938.54s)]
*  And we believe she meets all 11 criteria. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=943.5799999999999s)]
*  We have a law firm, a name Covington, whose workforce pro bono. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=946.3s)]
*  They've submitted the State Department legal brief arguing she meets all 11 criteria. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=950.78s)]
*  So Carla, we can't quite figure out, having said all that, why we can't this designation [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=955.26s)]
*  for her. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=960.5s)]
*  It's a little bit mysterious. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=961.5s)]
*  I think there's goodwill on the State Department. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=963.7s)]
*  There is support, but we want this too. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=965.94s)]
*  We need this too. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=968.4200000000001s)]
*  We think it's important. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=969.4200000000001s)]
*  We haven't gotten that yet. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=970.98s)]
*  And we don't have a good explanation why. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=972.22s)]
*  Well, the Wall Street Journal has done an extraordinary job of keeping Evan's case [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=973.98s)]
*  out there as well it should. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=980.1400000000001s)]
*  And as an alum of the Wall Street Journal, I'm really proud of what they have done, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=982.1800000000001s)]
*  unfortunately so far. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=986.0200000000001s)]
*  It hasn't moved Putin, but everyone has to be aware of his case and continue to push [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=987.5s)]
*  it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=993.26s)]
*  But we also have to be aware of also his case and continue to push that. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=994.26s)]
*  And if this designation could make a difference, State Department, wake up, pay attention. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=996.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1001.42s)]
*  And I would just add that, you know, I think that it is that attention and sort of unwillingness [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1002.42s)]
*  to give up and forget that is going to be important. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1007.26s)]
*  As I was preparing for this process, I was thinking back to my own experience when I [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1009.9s)]
*  was with the Associated Press. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1013.4599999999999s)]
*  I joined them in the late 80s and Terry Anderson had already been a hostage in Lebanon for [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1014.9s)]
*  a couple of years. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1019.6999999999999s)]
*  It turned out he ended up being a hostage for seven years, traded around by different [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1020.9000000000001s)]
*  groups. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1024.3400000000001s)]
*  But he was released when I was on the world desk at AP and him coming through that newsroom [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1025.3400000000001s)]
*  in New York. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1029.22s)]
*  It was one of those memorable moments that you have in life. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1030.22s)]
*  And here's this legendary figure, the name you had heard constantly, you know, almost [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1033.66s)]
*  many had given up, but there was a persistence there that the AP had, that his family had, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1037.6200000000001s)]
*  that US officials had. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1043.22s)]
*  And I think this is the type of thing that's going to be necessary. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1044.22s)]
*  And that was a case where you were dealing with this sort of shadowy group of terror [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1046.78s)]
*  groups and not a government per se. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1050.62s)]
*  Well, Bob, that's a very vivid and very important compelling example. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1053.46s)]
*  And to what we're talking about, first of all, Carla, your former reporter, The Wall [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1057.3s)]
*  Street Journal has been, in my judgment, splendid. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1061.7s)]
*  They don't have Evan out yet, but they really are a model and they've poured resources [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1064.5s)]
*  in and they see it as strategic. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1069.74s)]
*  They're trying to help him and his family and that's center, center, center. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1071.82s)]
*  But I think I can't speak for The Wall Street Journal. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1075.18s)]
*  But the fight for one is a fight for all. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1077.98s)]
*  And in the case of also, I can tell you, RFERL has 700 people in Prague and its headquarters, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1080.46s)]
*  another thousand in change, full on part time in more than two dozen countries, actually. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1086.8999999999999s)]
*  They all follow this case and they want to see her released, but they want to see us [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1091.98s)]
*  fighting for her. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1097.02s)]
*  That's very important. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1098.86s)]
*  Carla, let me, if I may ask you a question, what do you say to someone who says, but it's [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1101.02s)]
*  always this way in the past? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1107.94s)]
*  This isn't new. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1110.54s)]
*  I'm not sure there's a trend, but independent journalism has always suffered in closed [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1112.34s)]
*  authoritarian societies. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1120.54s)]
*  What's actually new about this story? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1122.86s)]
*  How would you respond to that? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1125.22s)]
*  Interesting question. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1126.98s)]
*  There are more authoritarian societies these days. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1128.3s)]
*  After a flourishing of democracy, we're going in a very disturbing trend. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1131.86s)]
*  That's one of the things that I worry about. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1136.6599999999999s)]
*  Second thing I worry about is that the United States leadership is at risk in terms of [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1138.98s)]
*  authoritarianism. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1143.66s)]
*  And as I think Bob was saying, is that we have this tech war going on that makes [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1144.78s)]
*  repression cross borders. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1148.94s)]
*  All of these things worry me. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1151.46s)]
*  And I think we in the press play an absolutely essential role in pushing back against this [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1153.22s)]
*  rise of authoritarianism. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1159.02s)]
*  And I think the other thing that really worries me is that people's loss of faith in [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1160.82s)]
*  institutions has extended to a loss of faith in the press. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1164.3799999999999s)]
*  As much as we know that we play an essential role in this fight against rising [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1167.9s)]
*  authoritarianism, there are questions that have been raised about our role as well. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1172.38s)]
*  So it's a struggle across the board for a lot of us. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1176.5400000000002s)]
*  So does that mean that we, I'll say in the West or the United States, do we suddenly or [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1180.94s)]
*  incrementally have less credibility to speak to these issues? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1189.3000000000002s)]
*  Or how do you judge how we're received? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1195.78s)]
*  When we do a podcast like this, I have a good sense of how we're received in L.A. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1198.1s)]
*  or New York or Washington or Paris or London or Berlin. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1202.6599999999999s)]
*  How do you imagine we're perceived today in Russia and Belarus and Iran and [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1206.1399999999999s)]
*  Afghanistan and so forth? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1212.98s)]
*  You would know the answer to that far better than I would, Jeff. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1215.3799999999999s)]
*  Don't you all do polling on those things? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1218.06s)]
*  Well, we do. And I have a view and it may not be complete. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1221.1399999999999s)]
*  It may not be fully accurate. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1224.54s)]
*  But I'll tell you through anecdote. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1226.58s)]
*  I recall once in my first tender RFRL being in Central Asia, I was actually in Kazakhstan [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1229.1399999999999s)]
*  being in a hotel lobby for a late night drink with a half a dozen journalists who [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1235.82s)]
*  railed and railed and railed against the United States of America for five and ten [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1241.34s)]
*  and fifteen different reasons. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1245.5s)]
*  And Karl and Bob, I said to them at one point, I had to go to bed. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1247.26s)]
*  I said, you know, it's not so easy to sell what we're doing in Washington, D.C. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1250.98s)]
*  with all the competing priorities of the United States of America. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1255.22s)]
*  And you all with your criticisms of us, you're really not making the case. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1258.66s)]
*  And then they all paused and said the same thing. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1263.1s)]
*  If not you, who? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1265.82s)]
*  You can't leave us. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1268.3s)]
*  We depend on you. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1269.78s)]
*  So I happen to believe that even when things are broken in the United States, I think [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1271.3s)]
*  they are and our politics are troubled. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1276.54s)]
*  I think they are. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1279.3s)]
*  I think people still look to us. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1281.1s)]
*  I hope they will still look to us and I hope we will not let them down. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1283.66s)]
*  And of course, though, the mission of RFRL is different from the mission of a Wall [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1288.46s)]
*  Street Journal or a New York Times or an associate press. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1292.42s)]
*  You do have more of a role to talk about the United States. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1297.46s)]
*  You represent the United States in many ways, don't you? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1302.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1305.26s)]
*  Well, traditionally, what I'm going to tell you is not a sharp and clear [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1305.58s)]
*  delineation, but traditionally RFRL and what Bob referred to as the so-called [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1309.1399999999999s)]
*  surrogate networks, that includes Radio Free Asia, for example, are trying to give [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1315.82s)]
*  countries that are closed or war torn or transitional, the news and information, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1320.6999999999998s)]
*  responsible reporting that they need that they're not getting from their [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1325.74s)]
*  indigenous media and certainly not from their governments. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1328.98s)]
*  Whereas Voice of America, not so black and white, but still Voice of America has [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1332.26s)]
*  always been in the business of talking to the world about the United States. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1337.22s)]
*  Not propaganda, not disinformation, but it's a large, complicated country [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1341.98s)]
*  filled with contradiction and to report on science and technology and politics [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1346.42s)]
*  and law and environment and crime and religion and ethnicity, it's a tall task. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1351.26s)]
*  And it's really vitally important. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1356.3799999999999s)]
*  Havel, VÃ¡clav Havel, remember the playwright who became the president of a [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1358.3400000000001s)]
*  free Czechoslovakia after the collapse of communism, he said, from Voice of [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1362.8200000000002s)]
*  America, I learned about the world, from Radio Free Europe, I learned about my own country. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1368.1000000000001s)]
*  And how do your reporters, though, feel they must occasionally report about the [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1373.5800000000002s)]
*  relationship between their own country and the United States? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1380.38s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1383.9s)]
*  And it's my view, Carla. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1385.26s)]
*  I've always said to journalists, the editors, the producers of RFERL during [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1387.54s)]
*  my two stints and now as a board member, I've always said we're in the business [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1392.82s)]
*  of journalistic integrity, rigor, truth telling, and you follow the story [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1398.1399999999999s)]
*  wherever it leads. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1405.7s)]
*  And so if someone said to me, the United States was responsible in country X for [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1407.06s)]
*  collateral damage, do we report on that? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1412.82s)]
*  I said, of course you do. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1415.34s)]
*  If that's part of the story and it goes to honesty, truthfulness and the [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1416.5s)]
*  credibility, the trust that you have and relationship you have with the audience, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1421.38s)]
*  you absolutely must. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1426.38s)]
*  And then I, as a footnote, you know, Bob is an alum and knows kind of this side of [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1427.74s)]
*  this work, then an editor, journalist, producer will say to me, so we're [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1432.02s)]
*  independent, we can report anything we want any time. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1437.58s)]
*  And then I always say, well, yes, responsibly, I don't expect a program [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1441.06s)]
*  from Iran on the stoning of women pro versus con. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1446.82s)]
*  So have an open mind, but not so open your brains fall out. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1452.6999999999998s)]
*  But do we report about the United States and relationships? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1456.8999999999999s)]
*  And I think honorably and honestly, I think one must. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1460.1399999999999s)]
*  Let me tell you, as a former deputy editor of the New York Times, we wouldn't [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1464.46s)]
*  have done the stoning of women in Iran pro versus con either. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1468.1399999999999s)]
*  So good. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1472.86s)]
*  We're of the same mind, not for the first time. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1474.58s)]
*  But I think the question I'm asking, because it's the question that you posed to [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1478.2199999999998s)]
*  me, which is the perception of the United States in the world, which is a somewhat [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1481.3s)]
*  critical one, certainly in the, in, you know, we struggled with this now and why [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1488.62s)]
*  so many countries have sat on the fence in terms of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1492.1s)]
*  So many countries that abstain right now. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1497.58s)]
*  Do you even in dealing with RFERL or dealing with Afghanistan, in which you had a [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1501.1799999999998s)]
*  grave disappointment with the United States withdrawal of Afghanistan, what is [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1506.78s)]
*  the perception of the United States? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1510.9399999999998s)]
*  So I think it's a very important question and I'm glad we're talking about it, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1513.26s)]
*  Carla. Of course it depends and this is not a monolith and it varies. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1517.5s)]
*  First, I put to both of you, I think we Americans should be self-aware. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1522.62s)]
*  That if you sit in any number of these countries, including developed democracies [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1527.8999999999999s)]
*  across Europe and the EU, and I'll make this up, but you're in your early forties, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1532.4199999999998s)]
*  the America you know, principally is not the America that emerged victorious with [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1537.9399999999998s)]
*  allies during the last chapter of the Cold War and the America of the 1990s. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1542.5s)]
*  The America that you know, and I exaggerate a little bit for effect, is the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1548.1399999999999s)]
*  America of Iraq, of Afghanistan. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1552.78s)]
*  We'll come right back to that. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1556.06s)]
*  Of the 2008 financial crisis of foreign policy where pendulum swing in a short [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1558.1s)]
*  amount of time from President Obama to President Trump. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1565.3s)]
*  That's a pretty big swing. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1568.1799999999998s)]
*  And no matter what you think of President Trump, I think it's fair to say that he [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1569.8999999999999s)]
*  projects a certain amount of instability, uncertainty, and his behavior is erratic. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1574.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's putting it mildly. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1580.94s)]
*  I'm trying to be diplomatic and but direct about it. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1582.34s)]
*  And so then if you have this case, Carla, as you said, of Afghanistan, let's call it [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1585.34s)]
*  what, whether you're for or against the exit. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1592.06s)]
*  I was against the exit. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1593.7s)]
*  Whether you're for or against the exit, the exit was botched horribly, I think. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1594.98s)]
*  And I think from an RFE perspective, if I may say, you know, we had a bureau in [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1599.62s)]
*  Kabul, we had reporters across all 34 provinces working hard with great integrity. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1604.94s)]
*  And then suddenly all this gets torn up. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1611.3799999999999s)]
*  It affects individuals, families, communities, livelihood, who stays, who [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1614.02s)]
*  leaves, who's threatened, who's arrested. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1620.34s)]
*  You know, my experience with our Afghan colleagues is that they have [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1623.66s)]
*  extraordinary grace and poise and patience and discipline and thoughtfulness. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1627.58s)]
*  But I think it's got to be terribly jarring and upsetting. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1633.86s)]
*  Remember, they serve us, they're dependent on us, but we need to [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1638.98s)]
*  serve them too and stand by them. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1643.8200000000002s)]
*  So the state of journalism is certainly dire, but I can't imagine a better way [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1647.3400000000001s)]
*  to spend one's life or a better career. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1651.42s)]
*  And for me, it's been a license to be infinitely curious. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1654.42s)]
*  One might say nosy. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1656.74s)]
*  I certainly never apologize for asking questions. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1658.06s)]
*  Looking back, Jeff, is there a story you wish you could go back and report on again? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1660.9s)]
*  First, Carla, I want to say I fully agree with you. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1664.8600000000001s)]
*  I think, I do think we undervalue journalism is a noble profession with [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1667.22s)]
*  enormous responsibility to truth seeking, to audience, and I think in a broad sort [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1675.8600000000001s)]
*  of way, the democratic idea, because democracy doesn't flourish without free [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1683.54s)]
*  people with access to information and without rulers or governments held accountable. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1687.5s)]
*  So I just want to say thank you for saying that. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1692.5s)]
*  I think it's so, so important for so many different reasons. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1695.66s)]
*  Stories, let me answer it in this way. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1698.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a little bit different than what you asked, but it's related. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1702.94s)]
*  I think now I'm trying to connect some dots that in this exile journalism, where [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1705.94s)]
*  the authoritarians push us outside the country and we have to report from outside [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1715.26s)]
*  the country, there are all sorts of logistical problems to that, but I think [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1721.78s)]
*  when families are still inside the country and friends and relatives, one [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1725.34s)]
*  problem is invariably you're going to run up against the challenge of [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1730.3s)]
*  self-situationship, because if I'm working in Washington, London, Paris, or [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1734.62s)]
*  Prague and my mother is back at home or my cousin, I can be very bold and brave in [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1737.8999999999999s)]
*  what I report, but they're the ones who are going to have a knock on the door in [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1745.26s)]
*  the middle of the night or have their freedom curtailed. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1749.6599999999999s)]
*  Particular stories, here's one for you. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1752.78s)]
*  In my first stint with RFIRO, we had an Iranian colleague named Nazi Asima who [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1756.4199999999998s)]
*  went home to visit her ill mother who was placed under house arrest and we did [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1762.58s)]
*  get her out within a year, she came back to Prague and the authorities told her [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1769.4199999999998s)]
*  revealingly, Carla and Bob, when you return, you may report on light [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1776.46s)]
*  international news, but nothing domestic or political or social, which says what [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1781.9s)]
*  nerve they're touching. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1787.6200000000001s)]
*  I might have used that at that time as a postmortem on the kind of journalism [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1789.34s)]
*  we're doing and the kind of journalism we can do, and I think she was a cultural [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1795.9s)]
*  reporter, Nazi Asima. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1801.98s)]
*  I think before she went and after we returned, we weren't entirely clear on [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1803.58s)]
*  how we were connecting the actual reporting she was doing with the audience [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1810.8600000000001s)]
*  needs and the regime's restrictions. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1816.6200000000001s)]
*  That's a little bit of a vague answer. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1819.42s)]
*  But Jeff, if I may just add a quick follow-up, did you see her cultural [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1821.02s)]
*  reporting as striking a nerve with the Iranian authorities? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1825.18s)]
*  Is cultural reporting something that in itself was controversial per se? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1827.74s)]
*  Well, it was. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1833.8200000000002s)]
*  She was a translator of American 19th century literature. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1834.8200000000002s)]
*  Why do these things touch a nerve? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1840.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, it must be independent thought. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1843.1000000000001s)]
*  It must be opening windows and doors for people that are looking for different [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1847.26s)]
*  ways to think about politics or their lives or about their communities. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1852.5800000000002s)]
*  Bob, that reminds me then of the Cold War figure who you may have known or know [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1857.54s)]
*  about in a Romanian named Monica Lovenescu, who reported on culture and [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1863.18s)]
*  history and literature and philosophy and music from Paris. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1869.26s)]
*  She was so feared and loathed by the Romanian dictatorship, led by Nicolae [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1873.98s)]
*  CeauÈ™escu, that he sent agents to beat her up and put her into a coma. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1879.14s)]
*  Well, culture, philosophy, literature, novels, fiction, why that? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1885.54s)]
*  I can only speculate for you and think independent thought in and of itself [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1891.18s)]
*  is a challenge and for the regime's control is paramount. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1899.22s)]
*  That's a great example. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1903.46s)]
*  I think Georgi Markov might be another one from the old RFE-RL days. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1904.5s)]
*  This was the famous victim of the infamous umbrella tip poisoning. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1909.18s)]
*  He was a contributor to RFE-RL from London, who used to send in his [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1913.46s)]
*  commentaries to the Bulgarian service, which had started to strike a chord, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1917.6200000000001s)]
*  shall we say, and one day was walking through a crowded London street, felt [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1922.02s)]
*  a pinch, went home, started feeling really bad and never really recovered [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1926.46s)]
*  and died and turned out what was believed to be an umbrella tipped with [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1931.0600000000002s)]
*  ricin, extremely toxic substance was used to stab him and he was snuffed [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1935.0600000000002s)]
*  out by that regime at that time. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1941.22s)]
*  So there are others examples too, but those are the stuff of lore. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1943.46s)]
*  That's a powerful and dramatic one. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1947.42s)]
*  And as we say, I think we say knowledge is power in closed or partially [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1949.1000000000001s)]
*  closed societies, access to information is empowerment and no one in control [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1953.94s)]
*  wants that. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1960.94s)]
*  So Bob, you are an active and influential editor and you've been an active [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1962.34s)]
*  and influential editor and journalist. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1967.18s)]
*  Is there anything you would like to revisit for us that you think had [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1970.02s)]
*  importance and relevance in a previous time, but is very relevant today? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1976.66s)]
*  The platforms change, but content to some extent, I like to say, is still king. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1982.06s)]
*  Anything you want to draw on from the past that we need to hear about today [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1986.78s)]
*  in today's context and environment? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1991.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, with the digital tools today, I sure would have loved to [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1994.02s)]
*  have an AI assistant in those early days of covering planning board meetings for [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=1997.82s)]
*  my local newspaper, which just many late nights pouring over zoning laws and [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2001.98s)]
*  other things. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2009.02s)]
*  And it was certainly a learning experience, but boy, having some digital [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2009.62s)]
*  assistance would have been nice. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2014.62s)]
*  But that was just the early days. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2015.78s)]
*  I think one thing I think of from my reporting days that wasn't too long ago, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2018.06s)]
*  but could have benefited from some of the tools today, and it could be [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2022.02s)]
*  interesting to go back actually, apropos your question, Jeff, is I did a lot of [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2026.1s)]
*  coverage for RFERL when I was their UN correspondent in the run up to the US [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2030.26s)]
*  invasion of Iraq. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2035.06s)]
*  And certainly as a UN correspondent, you're not really lacking for information [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2036.1399999999999s)]
*  that you have this incredible UN bureaucracy that's just pumping out [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2041.1399999999999s)]
*  information from all these agencies. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2044.62s)]
*  The UN correspondents are right down the hall from the UN secretary general's [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2046.94s)]
*  press office. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2050.62s)]
*  They have tons of information that they want to share as well. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2051.38s)]
*  And this was still the days, the early 2000s where you could rummage around the [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2054.82s)]
*  internet to find things. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2060.1800000000003s)]
*  But I think about today and what you can do with data viz and how useful it would [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2061.1000000000004s)]
*  have been to be able to try to connect the dots a little bit more on some of the [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2065.3s)]
*  things that were being raised as you saw this relentless effort by the Bush [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2068.34s)]
*  administration to kind of make its case for invading Iraq and where did they [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2072.98s)]
*  purchase the yellow cake and what were they doing in Niger and what was going on [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2077.38s)]
*  here and what was going on there. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2082.6200000000003s)]
*  And I think there would be just tremendous data viz opportunities both before and [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2083.7799999999997s)]
*  then after the invasion to try to put the pieces together because it ended up [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2089.2599999999998s)]
*  becoming an invasion. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2093.06s)]
*  It's a series of incidents. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2094.7s)]
*  It's a war that continues to reverberate in various ways today, among other things [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2096.22s)]
*  that spawned the so-called Islamic States rising. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2099.9399999999996s)]
*  It also was an incredibly traumatic period for the United Nations, including [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2103.22s)]
*  that first summer after that invasion bombing, one of the worst bombings I think [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2106.62s)]
*  ever inflicted on a UN institution, which was in Baghdad. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2110.46s)]
*  And one of the most well-regarded and admired UN officials who was put in charge [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2114.02s)]
*  of the UN mission, Sergio Villar de Mello, was killed. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2119.26s)]
*  And he was talking to, I believe that the story goes, he was talking to a former [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2122.1800000000003s)]
*  CFR fellow, Arthur Helton, in his office when the bomb went off. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2126.54s)]
*  The UN was traumatized to say the least from that. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2129.94s)]
*  They were also an institution that felt a bit, you know, kind of kicked around by [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2133.38s)]
*  the US, is one way to put it, in terms of the way that whole effort was pursued in [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2137.7s)]
*  the Security Council. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2141.8599999999997s)]
*  And then we're asked to take over the UN, the mission in Baghdad, and also to set [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2143.3799999999997s)]
*  up conditions for elections. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2147.98s)]
*  So it was a very interesting period to cover that story. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2149.98s)]
*  Not that the results would have been any different because the US was in a certain [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2153.06s)]
*  frame of mind back then. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2156.42s)]
*  And the way weapons of mass destruction were covered, it was very much like word of [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2157.7s)]
*  mouth. Various inspectors got a lot of currency and some of the other data, you [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2162.46s)]
*  know, might have might have been surfaced in a better way with some of the tools [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2167.42s)]
*  today. So that's one thing that sticks in my mind, Jeff. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2170.62s)]
*  So then if I may, I ask a following question to you, Bob, and to Carla as a [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2173.42s)]
*  journalist. So we've talked a lot about closed and partially closed and the [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2178.2200000000003s)]
*  responsibility and the need of markets for accurate, honest, truthful, reliable, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2184.1s)]
*  independently verifiable reporting. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2189.78s)]
*  But I want to come back to something that Carla raised about the importance of [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2191.9s)]
*  this profession and curiosity and service and accountability. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2195.9s)]
*  I called it noble about the responsibility, Bob and Carla. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2201.06s)]
*  How important is self-awareness for the individual journalist in the following [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2206.14s)]
*  ways? When you're reporting a story, you never work with a complete data set, if [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2212.38s)]
*  I may put it that way. There's always they're always missing pieces or different [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2217.02s)]
*  lenses through which you're not able to look at a given moment. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2221.7400000000002s)]
*  Second of all, my view, we all have assumptions. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2224.42s)]
*  We can claim that we're purely objective beings, but we come to subject matters and [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2227.78s)]
*  projects and work with assumptions. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2234.2200000000003s)]
*  Third, I ask you both, is there a little bit of a crowd effect because we're social [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2236.2200000000003s)]
*  beings and we go to dinners and conferences and sit in airport lounges and so forth? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2241.7400000000002s)]
*  And then even relationships, Carla, we're friends, Bob, we're friends. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2246.26s)]
*  How do we assure? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2250.2999999999997s)]
*  How does the individual journalist assure that they are doing the best job possible [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2252.22s)]
*  of playing the straightest game possible in real time when circumstances are suboptimal? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2258.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, real time is, of course, one of the biggest challenges because there is so much [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2264.7s)]
*  time pressure of deadline. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2269.3399999999997s)]
*  And, you know, I think it's Bob, it's great that you brought up the run up to the war [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2271.3799999999997s)]
*  in Iraq because it's it's two things. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2275.66s)]
*  I mean, I think I did a pretty bad job in the run up to the war in Iraq, and I think I [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2278.5s)]
*  got sucked into a lot of the group think. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2282.78s)]
*  So I think that sort of a healthy, healthy look at why we fell into this group think, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2285.7s)]
*  but also the group think post is really important. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2292.06s)]
*  This was an incredibly fraught time emotionally. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2295.1s)]
*  And I think self-awareness about how we blew that story is pretty important, Jeff. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2297.66s)]
*  Does time in the culture allow it? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2302.34s)]
*  More space for post mortems, examining what we did right and why and what we did wrong and why. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2304.82s)]
*  On that latter one, Jeff, I would love for maybe some deep pocket angel investor or [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2315.46s)]
*  somebody to help support a media entity that has or maybe it's a podcast for a while, like [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2320.1400000000003s)]
*  revisiting history or something where you go back in and you take the time to dig into it. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2325.1800000000003s)]
*  The whole run up to the Iraq war would be a great one. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2329.7400000000002s)]
*  There's many others, though. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2331.78s)]
*  It doesn't have to be something as epic as that, but it would be really helpful. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2333.3399999999997s)]
*  It would be helpful for the craft of journalism. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2337.1s)]
*  It could be something a journalism school might invest some time and money in and some do on [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2338.66s)]
*  smaller cases. There are definitely case studies. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2342.5s)]
*  And I think the self-awareness thing is crucial. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2345.02s)]
*  You can't bring it up enough, especially as we've had in the past decade or so, the advocacy [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2347.66s)]
*  journalism really rising. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2352.98s)]
*  And I mean, it's you see it everywhere where you're not considered a journalist unless you're [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2354.8199999999997s)]
*  weighing in with a point of view on something. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2360.14s)]
*  I think it's really it needs to be reminders, journalists taking a step back and stepping out [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2361.7799999999997s)]
*  of the story and covering the story itself and trying to do their best job. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2365.8999999999996s)]
*  And it's happening. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2370.22s)]
*  And, you know, back to our original conversation with this podcast, those journalists in exile [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2371.54s)]
*  who are facing the toughest backlash are the ones who are really hitting a chord because [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2376.74s)]
*  they're getting to the core of stories. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2380.8599999999997s)]
*  And one of the things that's heartbreaking, I know you've experienced this, Jeff, as well, is [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2382.74s)]
*  when you see places where journalism has been seeded, you know, like Afghanistan or Russia [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2387.22s)]
*  not too long ago, and you have some tremendous intrepid journalists and then they are quashed and [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2392.4599999999996s)]
*  then they are snuffed. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2398.14s)]
*  And those places are losing that. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2399.4199999999996s)]
*  And they're really losing something that's like a real part of the core of their of the strength of [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2401.4199999999996s)]
*  their society. And I think journalism is we've called it the fourth estate in the past in this [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2406.1s)]
*  country. We haven't heard that in quite a while. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2410.14s)]
*  We've heard enemy of the state. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2411.4599999999996s)]
*  I would like to see it back referred to in some realm as part of a one of the pillars of society. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2412.86s)]
*  And it does get to that sort of knowledge of craft, though. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2417.78s)]
*  Well, Bob, I think that you, Carla and I need to identify funding for a podcast or a small [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2421.38s)]
*  institute called Post Mortem. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2426.42s)]
*  And the tagline will be it starts with self-awareness. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2430.14s)]
*  And to what you said, Carla, it's really hard because to get it right is hard. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2435.34s)]
*  It's demanding work and it takes training and discipline and self-awareness. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2440.58s)]
*  But I think examining what we got right also and what we got wrong and why. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2446.02s)]
*  And in this town in Washington, D.C., it's really a town of narratives, more than it is a town of [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2452.2599999999998s)]
*  trying to get the fully accurate, honest account. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2459.42s)]
*  That sounds a little bit cynical, but I believe it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2462.9s)]
*  Well, Carla, you have shared on this podcast countless stories of reporting in the field. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2466.02s)]
*  And I've always wanted to go into more detail on a lot of those from Argentina, I think, to Kuwait, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2470.3799999999997s)]
*  even you've trotted the globe and then some. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2475.2999999999997s)]
*  Is there a story that you have never gotten over you'd like to share? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2477.94s)]
*  So much we report on is so grim that it's especially wondrous when we manage to find a happy [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2481.46s)]
*  ending. And I feel that way about Shelley's 1988 presidential plebiscite. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2487.2999999999997s)]
*  We as Americans, of course, were complicit in the 1973 overthrow of Salvador Allende. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2492.42s)]
*  And I don't think many people know that we also played a supporting role in helping the [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2497.18s)]
*  Democratic opposition, the so-called No Campaign, stop Pinochet from stealing the vote when the [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2500.58s)]
*  country was asked whether to keep him in power for another eight years. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2506.14s)]
*  And there were so many extraordinary moments unfolding behind the scenes after the hunt to [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2509.66s)]
*  stop the vote, count the C campaign quietly accepted the No Campaign's unofficial numbers, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2513.3799999999997s)]
*  tried to stage alleged terrorist attacks, the hunt to overruling Pinochet's last minute bid to [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2519.8599999999997s)]
*  stay in power. And I was relatively new to the business and I had incredible sort of behind the [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2524.94s)]
*  scenes access. And I don't think the stories that I wrote were particularly good because there was [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2531.02s)]
*  so much going on and it was so compressed. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2536.82s)]
*  And while I could write something of a narrative, it's only looking back and so many times later. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2538.98s)]
*  And I think that's a really good way that you assess how good a story you do when you tell people [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2545.26s)]
*  later. And then this happened and then you go back and you look at your stories and say, did I [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2549.02s)]
*  really highlight that well enough? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2553.1s)]
*  And it was an extraordinary moment. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2554.86s)]
*  And I wish I could go back and and tell that story again, because it was a triumph of of human [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2556.9s)]
*  dignity and one that we as Americans actually managed to support. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2565.22s)]
*  But perhaps the best moment of all and one that I didn't write about was the next morning. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2569.7799999999997s)]
*  After we knew that Pinochet had tried to steal this vote and even the hunt had stopped him from [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2576.18s)]
*  doing it, a small group of people stood in front of the presidential palace and as the guards were [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2581.5s)]
*  changing, they began to slowly clap. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2586.82s)]
*  And I was watching this from a distance and I didn't have a chance to ask them why they were [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2590.74s)]
*  clapping. And I always assumed that they were clapping because the military after torturing [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2595.7s)]
*  people for such a long period of time had done the right thing. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2601.74s)]
*  They had decided to step aside. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2604.86s)]
*  But when I was thinking about this the other day, I wondered whether perhaps those were military [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2606.86s)]
*  supporters and that maybe they were clapping for another reason, which is a reminder that we really [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2611.6600000000003s)]
*  do have to ask people why they do what they do. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2617.86s)]
*  Carl, that's a great story and a reminder also of Chile's role in history and also of the [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2620.7000000000003s)]
*  sometimes nuanced role the US can play in some of those bigger narratives as well. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2626.6600000000003s)]
*  And it does get back to that point of reporting, though, at the end of the day, it's being on the [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2630.9s)]
*  ground or at least on the other end of a phone line and asking questions of real people in real [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2635.14s)]
*  time and then filing on deadline. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2640.3399999999997s)]
*  And we mentioned deadline filing. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2642.2599999999998s)]
*  I think that's the other thing you can't overlook is sometimes you have a news desk or somebody [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2644.1s)]
*  leaning on you to get something in and you're going to cut corners and file what you can and maybe [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2649.06s)]
*  miss some of the flavor of something. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2653.7s)]
*  But, you know, I do think your reminiscence about Chile will stand out for some. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2655.22s)]
*  And that wraps up our special World Press Freedom episode of The World Next Week. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2xavzTpA6Y&t=2660.54s)]
