# Rwanda 30 Years After Genocide, U.S.-Japan-Philippines Summit, ABBA’s Eurovision Legacy, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY)
*  In the coming week, Rwanda marks 30 years since its genocide. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=0.0s)]
*  The White House hosts leaders from Japan and the Philippines. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And the Eurovision Song Contest marks 50 years since ABBA's big moment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=7.44s)]
*  It's April 4th, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=12.32s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=16.0s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. Bob, welcome back. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=28.479999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Did you have a fun time? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=32.08s)]
*  I did. Thank you very much. Cold Easter break, but it was nice. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, this is quite a transition here then. So let's start in Rwanda. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=36.0s)]
*  On Sunday, April 7th, the country is going to commemorate the 30-year [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=40.8s)]
*  anniversary of the ethnic genocide against the Tutsi population. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=44.56s)]
*  In over 100 days, a radical extremist faction of Hutus killed 800,000 Rwandans. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  The United States, France, the UN Security Council all failed horribly. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=55.36s)]
*  And in a video to be released this Sunday, President Emmanuel Macron of France says that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=60.72s)]
*  France, which could have stopped the genocide with its Western and African allies, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=65.52s)]
*  lacked the will to do so. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=69.28s)]
*  Rwanda these days has a really complicated standing in the world, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=71.44s)]
*  and its president, Paul Kagame, has been called the West's favorite autocrat. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=74.56s)]
*  How should we be feeling about this anniversary, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  and how should we be feeling about our relationship with Rwanda? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=80.8s)]
*  Well, as you had set up, Karla, complicated, it doesn't begin to say [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=84.08s)]
*  what the relationship's like, but it has to certainly be pegged back to the moment of the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=88.08s)]
*  genocide. And it's worth noting that the genocide didn't pop up out of nowhere. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=94.16s)]
*  There were ample warnings. The UN had a number of tripwire warnings that came out [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=98.96s)]
*  months and months ahead of what happened, basically warning of a powder keg between [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=104.8s)]
*  the Hutus and the minority Tutsis. And then when the killing started, and actually ahead [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=109.04s)]
*  of the killing, there were UN peacekeeping officials who were saying, you know, a certain [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=114.64s)]
*  number of peacekeepers could prevent slaughter. They were not promised. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=118.56s)]
*  We should also remember this occurred after, not too long after the horrible Black Hawk Down [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  incident in Somalia, where US-led peacekeepers, among others, got embroiled in a deadly conflict [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=128.0s)]
*  there. That certainly colored it, but it certainly doesn't dismiss what then happened, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=135.44s)]
*  which was a real failure of the Security Council to act when it could have and when it was warned [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=140.32s)]
*  about it. I would recommend people, if they want to get a sense of how this was building and what [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=144.4s)]
*  was happening, there's a devastating front-line documentary about that, including capturing on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=149.04s)]
*  the scene. They had crews, camera crews, were on the scene as Western peacekeepers and diplomats [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=155.12s)]
*  were coming to Rwanda and there were Tutsis there sort of begging them to take them with them. And [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=160.32s)]
*  it's really tough to watch, but it was fast. It was brutal. And it was ended by Paul Kagame's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=166.72s)]
*  RPF forces and his movement that took over the country and to this day, run the country as a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=173.84s)]
*  single movement, a single individual. Kagame is part of this complicated relationship. He has [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  undoubtedly put the country back on its feet, ended the ethnic tensions while still installing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=184.72s)]
*  a leadership that is accused of favoring Tutsis, the minority Tutsis, and has gotten involved in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=192.55999999999997s)]
*  supporting an armed movement in Eastern Congo that is said to be contributing to expanding bloodshed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  there. But at the same time in Rwanda itself, he has improved the country's economic stability, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  its living standards, its life expectancy has gone up from something like 49, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=211.52s)]
*  30 years ago to 66 now. It has had over the last several decades, 8% growth on an annual basis. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=216.56s)]
*  And as you say, it got this reputation of leading the Singapore of the Lake District of Africa, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=223.36s)]
*  some people have termed it, while being autocratic in the process. He is by most accounts going to be [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=230.24s)]
*  a leader for life. There are elections this summer that he is supposed to win handily. And [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=235.44s)]
*  as the economist noted, and it's in an imitable way in a recent article, in the land of a thousand [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=240.4s)]
*  hills, only one man can have the moral high ground, and that is Paul Kagame. So this is the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  situation, this is the legacy today, and it is a country that continues to get a good deal of aid, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  and by many accounts uses it well because of the guilt that has arisen from the episode 30 years ago. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=256.24s)]
*  And for some more helpful background and context about Rwanda's path the last 30 years, I commend [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=263.36s)]
*  our colleague, Mariel Ferragamo's piece that we put up on CFR.org this week looking at the country's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=268.32s)]
*  path. Rwanda has also been in the news because of Kagame's willingness to participate in this completely [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=273.76s)]
*  morally weird deal that is yet to go through with the Brits, taking in migrants. And I think he [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=282.56s)]
*  cut this originally with Boris Johnson. And the moral ambivalence of these relationships is so odd. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=290.4s)]
*  Is it based on the guilt of the West that he gets such an enormous pass, or is he playing a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=297.2s)]
*  useful role for countries? I think it's a combination, certainly. I mean, as was pointed out [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=303.36s)]
*  in the economist article I mentioned in other places, Kagame has been very skillful as using [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=308.56s)]
*  Rwanda's leverage diplomatically, whether it's working on a deal to take asylum seekers [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=314.08s)]
*  with the UK. By the way, he had signed a deal a few years earlier with Denmark to do the same thing, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=318.8s)]
*  and he set up an asylum center in the capital, Kigali. He has maintained relations with Russia [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=323.28s)]
*  while at the same time being seen as a counterpoint to the Russian attempts to be an influential [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=330.0s)]
*  security broker in Africa. Rwanda itself plays a role in exporting peacekeeping into other [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=335.44s)]
*  countries in Africa, for example. He has maintained relationship with China. China has built a lot of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  infrastructure in Rwanda while also keeping China at arm's length, and is able to be accepted in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=345.52s)]
*  Western capitals to this day despite policies that have earned him some rebuke, especially [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=351.12s)]
*  probably more so from the US than some of the European capitals. But you can't get past the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=357.92s)]
*  heavy guilt that a lot of these countries feel for what was allowed to happen in 1994, in the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=362.08s)]
*  spring of 1994. Again, as I say, at a time when Africa is dealing with the backlash against [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=368.32s)]
*  democracy or backsliding of democracy, and it's dealing with an encroachment of Russian forces, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=374.64s)]
*  the Wagner Group and so forth, and it's dealing with other problems, climate-driven, and look [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=380.64s)]
*  what's going on in Sudan now and so forth, Rwanda is this place of relative stability, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=385.44s)]
*  but it's also exporting instability in terms of what it's doing in Eastern Congo. So again, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=390.8s)]
*  very complicated relationship. It's somebody who has to be dealt with and has to be, I think, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  engaged by countries in the West, but also not fully obviously embraced. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  Madeline Albright used to say this was her greatest regret, the failure in Rwanda. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=406.8s)]
*  There is that profound guilt, so when you hear Macron talk about it, it is quite compelling. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  But at the same time, in its 2024 report, Freedom House says that the country has [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=416.08s)]
*  rates Rwanda is not free, says they suppress political dissent, pervasive surveillance, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  intimidation, arbitrary detention. It's really terrible when you see the heroes fall. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=428.0s)]
*  Bob, let's move to Washington. Next Wednesday kicks off back-to-back White House summits, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=433.12s)]
*  first an official state visit for Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, followed by a trilateral [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  summit joined by Philippines President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr. And there's a lot going on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=444.8s)]
*  with these visits. There's going to be a new security pact between Japan and the U.S. and then, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=450.0s)]
*  of course, this first ever summit between the three leaders. What are you going to be looking [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=454.48s)]
*  for in these meetings? It's going to be very interesting to see [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=458.32s)]
*  that the meetings in which certainly the concern about China is permeating, how much they openly [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=463.12s)]
*  say that versus how much they use other language to kind of maybe just make it a reference as [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=469.76s)]
*  opposed to an explicit either condemnation or warning sign or whatever. And I say that partly [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=474.48s)]
*  because we started off the week with what was reported to be a two-hour call between President [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=479.92s)]
*  Biden and Xi Jinping, where they were supposedly having a ongoing frank productive exchange, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=484.8s)]
*  according to some of the readouts from both sides. And you have Janet Yellen putting in a pretty long [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=490.96s)]
*  visit to China as we went to tape this podcast, raising concerns about Chinese, among other things, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=496.0s)]
*  flooding of various tech products, including solar panels on Western markets in the U.S. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=502.32s)]
*  But at the same time, a real desire by the U.S. to maintain dialogue and not to overly antagonize [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=508.56s)]
*  China, keep the lines of dialogue open. But make no mistake, this meeting, this trilateral summit is [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=515.12s)]
*  about trying to project calm and security in this part of the world where there's been remarkable [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=519.76s)]
*  sort of advance in a security web where Japan is an important part of this. And I should just note [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=525.76s)]
*  our colleague Sheila Smith has been tracking this for years since Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=532.08s)]
*  revised the constitution to open up its defense policies a bit more and its ability to exercise [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=537.12s)]
*  defense in a projection way. Japan is now openly engaging with the Philippines and working to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=543.2s)]
*  get involved in exercises and in training Filipino forces. And it had a trilateral summit [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=549.76s)]
*  last summer with South Korea. That was a really big deal because Japan and South Korea have had a [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=554.88s)]
*  really rough relationship for decades stemming from World War II era atrocities by Japanese [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=560.16s)]
*  forces. And so we're in a moment where Japan is taking on a new role. Philippines under Marcos [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=565.68s)]
*  has somewhat surprisingly come to the U.S. much more quickly than had been expected following the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=572.88s)]
*  Duterte era of leadership in Philippines. And we're in a time when China has been ramping up [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=578.64s)]
*  its assertions of sovereignty in the South China Sea, but also vis-a-vis Taiwan. It's got disputes [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=585.68s)]
*  with Japan over the Senkaku, Diaoyu Islands. And so all of that is a backdrop to really important [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=592.64s)]
*  security discussions between the three. And then economic as well. There's going to be some important [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=598.64s)]
*  economic overtones coming out of these talks, both bilaterally and trilaterally. So I think [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=603.04s)]
*  what's called the U.S.-Philippines-Japan Triad is going to be something that is going to be [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=608.08s)]
*  bearing a closer watch as they potentially enter into more binding agreements. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=612.1600000000001s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Two things I suppose about Japan. One is how much of this is a Trump effect [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=616.88s)]
*  versus just a natural evolution reaction to China and North Korea. I mean, every time the North [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=622.48s)]
*  Koreans test another missile and it tumbles close to Japan, they have pretty good reason to be [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=628.4000000000001s)]
*  nervous. But it's also, they've got this constitution that bans them from possessing any war [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=633.6s)]
*  potential, what this is Article 9. How close to the edge are they coming to violating their own [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=640.96s)]
*  Article 9? I mean, with all these purchases they're planning on making and this closer and closer [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=645.44s)]
*  security relationship with the U.S. BARRY I think they're very carefully, you know, walking up to [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=650.0s)]
*  that line by most accounts. And let's just talk about some of that spending. For example, they [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=655.44s)]
*  have a plan in place to increase security capabilities by something like $320 billion, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=660.08s)]
*  which would raise defense spending to 2% of GDP over five years. That's the level of what NATO [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  countries have committed to holding and that only maybe a third of them have done so. Japan is saying [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  it will do that over five years. And this is for things like Tomahawk cruise missiles and F-35 [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=675.36s)]
*  fighter jets. LESLIE KENDRICK Actually, NATO is saying that they're going to be half. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=680.24s)]
*  BARRY I Oh, is it going to be half? Okay. In any event, Japan is already jumping into this as a [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  non-NATO member, but as a sign of its willingness to get involved in this alliance of the East [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=687.6s)]
*  Asian countries and working more closely with the U.S. And I propose your question, you know, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  basically if a Trump administration part two comes into office presenting to them the fact that they [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=698.48s)]
*  are a reliable ally and that these are ties that are worth cultivating, continuing and strengthening, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=704.24s)]
*  it's worth noting that under the first Trump administration, Japan rather skillfully handled [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  that relationship. It was one of the first visits I think Trump had was with Shinzo Abe. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=715.12s)]
*  And so we should definitely take that into consideration. I think every country, every [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=720.0s)]
*  U.S. ally certainly is weighing those calculations as we prepare in the U.S. for the Biden Trump part [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=724.16s)]
*  two. And so that's definitely a backdrop. Trump administration is certainly not willing to sort [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=730.48s)]
*  of open the door to China. It had laid out some markers against China. It had set in force some [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=737.12s)]
*  alliance, Indo-Pacific alliance activities as well. So that's also worth considering. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=741.76s)]
*  But I think it's all a backdrop to where things are going. You're right to note the North Korean [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=747.36s)]
*  threat. North Korea has, if anything, just ramped up its provocations, its testing, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=751.76s)]
*  its testing of missiles that come really close to Japanese territory and waters [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=756.48s)]
*  or over Japanese territory. And so it's just survival mode. And I think the North Korean part [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=760.56s)]
*  in particular is something that gives the Japanese more and more confidence that they can continue to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=765.92s)]
*  adjust their constitution to meet the moment. Karl, I'm going to take us in a completely [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=771.92s)]
*  different direction and talk about Waterloo and not the famous battle of 200 years ago. Oh no, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=776.48s)]
*  we're talking about ABBA. Let's go to Sweden. Saturday marks 50 years since the band ABBA [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=784.0s)]
*  performed the famous Waterloo song at the Eurovision Song Contest and won. That song, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=789.6s)]
*  I think most people just hearing it of almost any generation, they'll immediately go to the earworm [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=794.96s)]
*  chorus. But ABBA's 1974 performance was a catalyst that brought this group instant global fame. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=800.08s)]
*  They did not rest on their laurels and they weren't by no account a one-hit wonder. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=811.36s)]
*  So as our resident ABBA fan, why this has such staying power? Why is this Eurovision moment [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=815.9200000000001s)]
*  living on? I mean, this is just, I mean, it's just, it's great music. Let me start again. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=823.12s)]
*  Is it great music? There's very little about the 1970s aesthetic that I remember fondly, Bob. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=831.84s)]
*  But the kitchiness, the singability, it's just an enormous amount of fun, ABBA. And it's probably [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=838.96s)]
*  my favorite thing about an era of, oh my God, the clothes, the haircuts, everything else was so grim. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=846.32s)]
*  ABBA is just an enormous amount of fun and Waterloo is a truly great song. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=853.76s)]
*  And this year's celebration of ABBA's breakout win is really becoming just an incredibly massive [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=859.28s)]
*  thing. The Brits in particular like to claim at least partial ownership for ABBA since the big [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=864.48s)]
*  win took place in Brighton and the band lived there for a while. And BBC Two is celebrating [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=870.32s)]
*  the anniversary with a dedicated night of ABBA programming, including a new documentary when [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=876.08s)]
*  ABBA came to Britain. There are as we claim them. The city of Brighton, never missing an opportunity [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=881.6s)]
*  to invite tourists, has a four day celebration, four count them days, planned with ABBA shows, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=887.6s)]
*  bus rides, painting sessions, an exhibition of the Brighton Museum and Art Gallery. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=892.72s)]
*  And at the venue where the big Eurovision win took place, there's going to be another Eurovision [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=897.44s)]
*  winner, Charlotte, and what they describe as Eurovision royalty will be performing off his [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  greatest hits. Backed up, and this actually I really wish I could go see by the famous [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=907.52s)]
*  Brighton Gay Men's Chorus. So this is going to be a major celebration. And it should be noted that [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=912.48s)]
*  Sweden won the honor of hosting this year's Eurovision in May and they were expected to go [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=918.16s)]
*  all in on ABBA. And under the contest rules, the countries who singer wins the previous year gets [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=924.16s)]
*  to host this year. And when it's singer Laureen or I think I'm pronouncing that correctly, it could [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=930.0799999999999s)]
*  be Laureen. We'll have to look that up. One last year's competition, it sparked an online [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=935.92s)]
*  conspiracy that the system had been totally rigged so that the contest could be held in ABBA's home [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=940.8s)]
*  field for the anniversary. That's how much attention Eurovision gets and how much attention [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=946.24s)]
*  ABBA itself gets. Finally, it also needs to be noted that ABBA made very clear that they are not [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  going to be performing at Eurovision this year. Last time they played together was on the BBC in [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  1982, which is a very long time ago. But there are still hopes that they're holographic avatars, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=962.8s)]
*  which are called, Bob, can you guess? No. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=969.76s)]
*  Avatars. Of course. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=972.8s)]
*  And there's hope that the avatars are going to be able to show up. And they have been playing at [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  this specially created arena in London. More than 1.6 million people have gone to see them. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=981.92s)]
*  And these are digital recreations based on the real band members who've been filmed in motion [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=988.8s)]
*  capture suits. And people pay an enormous amount of money in London to go see them. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=993.04s)]
*  Whether or not they can actually transfer the technology to Malmo, Sweden, we're not clear on [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=997.52s)]
*  yet. But stay tuned for what is going to be an enormous celebration of Waterloo and the ABBA [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1002.72s)]
*  phenom. So Carla, Eurovision launched then ABBA in many ways, but I would think that ABBA's [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1008.32s)]
*  success might have been a boost for Eurovision itself. I mean, this is a contest that still [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1016.16s)]
*  mystifies many Americans, but anybody who's been to Europe for any amount of time, it's a big deal [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1021.36s)]
*  and it has remained a big deal. Is that the case or was Eurovision too big to even get a boost by [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1025.84s)]
*  ABBA? Well, I don't know. I think you talk to Europeans, they're really devoted to Eurovision. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  And the way it works is that it started back in 1956. And it is this joint effort by the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1036.32s)]
*  European Broadcasting Union, which calls itself an alliance of public service media organizations. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1042.96s)]
*  And each country has its own public broadcaster, which nominates their one candidate. And the rules [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1048.24s)]
*  are, it has to be an original song, can only be for the final only three minutes long. And the rules [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1057.2s)]
*  have gone back and forth whether or not it has to be in native language. Of course, Waterloo is in [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  English and not in Swedish. And my devotion to the podcast, if you go on YouTube, you can see [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1069.68s)]
*  clips in one, actually one particular YouTube clip of every Eurovision winner from 1956 on. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1079.04s)]
*  And I will say, and I don't mean to sound elitist about this, there's a lot there that I'm not going [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1088.24s)]
*  to be singing along to, I will say, but Celine Dion was a winner. So there have been some, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1094.3200000000002s)]
*  and I think the rules are, and they've changed somewhat over time, but the rules are basically [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1099.36s)]
*  there's judges, but there's also people vote. People used to call in and then of course you [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1105.12s)]
*  go on the internet, there's all sorts of ways people, and you can't vote for your own country. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1109.6s)]
*  And there are all sorts of interesting rules. I think it's much less foreign to Americans than [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1113.6s)]
*  it used to be because we've got all these other, Simon Cowell and all these other things that now [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1117.92s)]
*  happen. And they're also, of course, all transmits from Europe as well. But this is a big thing. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1123.6s)]
*  And I was at the CFR event in San Francisco where I am last night, and I mentioned that we [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1128.72s)]
*  were going to be doing this. And two things, once I mentioned that it was because the anniversary of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1134.72s)]
*  Waterloo and a bunch of much younger than us people immediately started humming Waterloo, which gives [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1139.68s)]
*  you a sense of the appeal of it. And the other thing is there were a couple of Europeans there [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1145.76s)]
*  who all went, oh my God, Eurovision. So it's clearly, certainly got a big pull to it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1148.96s)]
*  And the other winners, I can tell you, Bob, there are a lot of people you've never heard of. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1154.88s)]
*  So maybe in Abba's case, you could say the winner takes it all, but not other winners. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1159.2s)]
*  Give me, give me, give me a break. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1166.88s)]
*  We'll stop there, but we will post that list that you mentioned on our show notes page, Carla, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1170.08s)]
*  because I think it's going to be crucial to pour over that for those interested. Carla, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1174.32s)]
*  we've we've sung ourselves into the audience figure of the week portion of the podcast. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1179.3600000000001s)]
*  This is the figure that listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1183.84s)]
*  Instagram story. This week, Carla, our audience selected opposition Ekrem Emamolu wins Istanbul. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  This is the mayorship of Istanbul we're talking about. Why is losing that race bad for [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1204.48s)]
*  It certainly makes Erdogan, who we talk about a lot on the podcast, look a lot less invincible [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  and one hopes that it could be a good thing for Turkey's better democracy. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1215.5200000000002s)]
*  We discussed last year how Erdogan used the power of his office, including his control of media [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1220.24s)]
*  and the budget to win reelection, despite a really devastating earthquake and hugely high inflation. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1225.68s)]
*  And the expectation this year was that he was going to once again, bully his wife, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1232.0800000000002s)]
*  once again, bully his way through these elections as well. And the polls look that way. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1235.6s)]
*  But instead, the opposition not only won big in Istanbul and Emamolu won reelection by 11 and a [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1240.8799999999999s)]
*  half percentage points over a candidate that Erdogan really went all in for the opposition [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1247.28s)]
*  Republican People's Party will now run 35 of the country's cities up from 21, including the top [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1253.28s)]
*  five largest cities, Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa, and Antalya. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1258.88s)]
*  So this is a pretty devastating setback for Erdogan just less than a year after he won [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1264.24s)]
*  the presidential election. So there's a real message in there. And what makes this loss [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1270.3200000000002s)]
*  in particularly hard is that Erdogan made his career as an opposition leader who first came [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1275.6000000000001s)]
*  to power as mayor of Istanbul. And adding insult to injury, he did his best to try to thwart the [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1280.24s)]
*  rise of Emamolu from the start. When Emamolu ran, you recall, Emamolu won. He briefly held the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1287.28s)]
*  mayorship. Erdogan lobbied. He claims he didn't do it, but the election commission, they took [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1294.8s)]
*  Emamolu out. They reran the election and Emamolu won a second time. So this is, you know, he's been [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1302.08s)]
*  trying to thwart him. And I think the fact that he manages to win despite Erdogan repeatedly is [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1308.48s)]
*  sending the message, A, that Erdogan is not invincible and B, that when the elections come [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1314.72s)]
*  around again in 28, he's the logical candidate. Now, Erdogan is term limited. He has said that [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1318.96s)]
*  this was going to be his last election. But the betting is, and it may just be because this is a [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1324.72s)]
*  country that can't imagine itself without the autocrat in power, but it may be that Erdogan [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1329.6000000000001s)]
*  will try to figure out another way to stay in power and we'll see a face-off between Erdogan [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1334.88s)]
*  and Emamolu. But it's not till 2028. Yeah, I think you're right. I think that's [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1339.52s)]
*  something to watch very closely. It's maybe a moment for cautious optimism that is such [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1344.56s)]
*  a surprising result. The fact that Erdogan allowed the party to run candidates in all these places [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1350.56s)]
*  still points out that there is some, you know, some room for democratic exercising Turkey. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1356.8799999999999s)]
*  But also shows, I think, that public is pretty much fed up with this economic stewardship. I mean, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1362.72s)]
*  it's whether it's corruption scandals or just the tinkering in the, you know, the currency, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1368.08s)]
*  other things, the response to and the preparations for sustaining infrastructure under earthquakes. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1374.0s)]
*  All those things seem to have added up to a real problem for Erdogan that [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  even some stage managing elections could not overcome. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1384.48s)]
*  Erdogan's a very good politician. The question is whether he has so much power and [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1388.3200000000002s)]
*  these guys after a while so lose touch with what's going on around them. I don't know whether he's [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1396.5600000000002s)]
*  going to get the message. We'll have to see. And he's in a very dangerous neighborhood. We've [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1403.28s)]
*  talked about him before as playing somewhat of a broker role, at least in the initial phases of the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1408.48s)]
*  Russian invasion of Ukraine. And it's obviously Turkey's strategically important NATO member [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1412.8799999999999s)]
*  with a autocratically minded leader at the moment. So a lot at stake and some stirrings of democracy. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1418.56s)]
*  So let's give it at least two cheers. And meanwhile, one final note. In December [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1425.36s)]
*  22, a Turkish court sentenced Imamola to two years and seven months in prison [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1430.96s)]
*  and imposed a political ban for when he insulted public officials in his speech [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1436.56s)]
*  after his June 2019 win. He said, quote, the ones who canceled the March 31st election, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1442.32s)]
*  which is the Supreme Election Council, are fools. He appealed the case and the appeals [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1448.56s)]
*  court hasn't made a decision yet. Could they now retake the case because he's, you know, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1453.1200000000001s)]
*  he's once again humiliated the AK? We'll have to see that as well. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1459.76s)]
*  More intrigue as we go into this mega year of elections that we've been talking about [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEAMx9CNuY&t=1464.0s)]
