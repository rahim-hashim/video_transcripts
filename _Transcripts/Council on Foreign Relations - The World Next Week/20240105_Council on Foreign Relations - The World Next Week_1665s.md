# Mideast Tensions Grow, CES Spotlights AI, Divided U.S. Congress Returns, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig)
*  In the coming week, rising Mideast tensions spur a new round of US diplomacy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=0.0s)]
*  The consumer electronics show in Las Vegas spotlights AI and war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=5.14s)]
*  And the US Congress is back in session, with the government's shutdown looming. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=9.34s)]
*  It's January 4th, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=12.66s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=27.34s)]
*  And I'm Carla Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=28.34s)]
*  Carla, first off, welcome to 2024. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=29.38s)]
*  It's, it's already feels like a burdensome year, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=31.86s)]
*  Um, while we have been away, the world has not stopped turning and churning in turmoil. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=35.94s)]
*  There is a conflict continuing in Gaza now three months or so already since October 7th. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=41.94s)]
*  US secretary of state, Antony Blinken is traveling to Israel for a fifth time since October 7th. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=47.94s)]
*  And he has plans to visit other parts of the region. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=53.900000000000006s)]
*  The most recent big news out of the region was the fatal drone strike on Hamas leader Saleh Al-Aroori in Beirut. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=56.58s)]
*  What sort of US messaging can we expect? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=64.7s)]
*  Well, Bob, happy new year. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=67.82s)]
*  And unfortunately, the news in the Middle East is as grim and if possible, even more [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=69.34s)]
*  disturbing as it was in the old year. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=73.1s)]
*  So the latest developments as of Thursday morning, when we're taping this is on Tuesday, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  there was an explosion in a Beirut suburb killing Al-Aroori, who was the deputy Hamas minister. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=80.22s)]
*  And he was the group's key liaison with Iran and everyone is attributing this to the Israelis. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=85.22s)]
*  They haven't claimed responsibility, but they're already taking something of a victory lap on it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=90.18s)]
*  Then on Wednesday, there were two explosions in Iran, which left scores of people dead. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=95.38000000000001s)]
*  And the Israelis have a long history of assassinations in Iran, nuclear scientists blowing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=100.26s)]
*  up missile facilities, but the even Iran's supreme leader who issued a statement and was threatening, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=104.9s)]
*  you know, a response. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=110.42s)]
*  He blamed the attack on malicious and criminal enemies, but he really stopped short of naming [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=111.62s)]
*  the Israelis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=116.26s)]
*  And hours after this horrific bombings in Iran, the United States and a dozen allies warned Yemen's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=117.54s)]
*  Houthis that they were going to face consequences should they continue attacks against ships on the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=123.14s)]
*  Red Sea. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=127.38000000000001s)]
*  Last weekend, after the Houthis fired on US helicopters who were protecting a cargo ship, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=128.9s)]
*  the US Navy sank three Houthi boats. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=134.1s)]
*  But the US has been pretty restrained when it comes to the Houthis. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=136.26s)]
*  This is the first time they've really implied potential military consequences, because I don't [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=138.98s)]
*  think they really want to threaten this really fragile truce in Yemen, but maybe there's more [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=144.34s)]
*  to come on that front. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=148.5s)]
*  So all of these developments are really raising fears that what has been a really horrifying war [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  in Gaza and Israel that has really mainly been contained with some shelling on the borders could [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=155.14s)]
*  now be spinning out of control. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  So when we first heard of Secretary of State Blinken's visit to the region, and this is going [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=162.26s)]
*  to be, as you said, his fifth to Israel and his fourth around the region since the war started, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=166.58s)]
*  we really thought it was going to be primarily focused on urging the Israelis to reel back [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  the war in Gaza. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=174.9s)]
*  And now it seems to have a much wider agenda, trying to stop the conflict from spinning out [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=176.34s)]
*  of control. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=180.02s)]
*  . [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=180.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot, Carla. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  So on the Al-Aururi assassination, if that's in fact what it was, and again, as you said, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=182.9s)]
*  it seems to be the case. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=188.18s)]
*  Israelis rarely comment on such things, but it does really seem like it has, according to some [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=189.46s)]
*  experts in the Israeli markings. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=195.54s)]
*  This is big on a number of fronts, and some experts have said it signals as there's a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=197.7s)]
*  troop pulldown in Gaza, maybe the Israelis opening up a new chapter in their strikes [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=201.94s)]
*  against Hamas. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=206.66s)]
*  They have already been threatening Hamas leaders in the past. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  Does this then pose a threat, or should we look closely at what the Hezbollah leader had to say, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=211.14s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, where he carefully parsed his words and it's still going to be contained? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=217.22s)]
*  Well, US officials have been saying before this that they didn't think that the Israelis would [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  do a strike in Beirut if they thought this was going to spark a fallout war with Lebanon. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=228.5s)]
*  But were they calculating that some other group was going to do something in Iran, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=233.94s)]
*  and you can't calculate these things. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  Bad things happen, and there's always a potential for wider things. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=241.46s)]
*  The US has been pushing the Israelis really from the beginning of this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=244.5s)]
*  If you remember when Biden went to Israel right after the October 7th attacks and said, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=247.54s)]
*  totally sympathize and empathize with this, but don't let your rage consume you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=253.62s)]
*  They've been pushing publicly, privately, privately, publicly to say to the Israelis, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=258.02s)]
*  blunt instruments is not what you want to do here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=263.94s)]
*  You guys are really good at targeted strikes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=266.58s)]
*  You guys have great special operators. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=268.74s)]
*  The Israelis haven't listened. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=271.38s)]
*  More than 21,000 people have died in Gaza. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=272.82s)]
*  And Austin in particular said they were really in danger of losing this war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=276.09999999999997s)]
*  They might have won some battles on the ground, but they're going to lose the war if they turn [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  generations of people in Gaza against them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=284.58s)]
*  And so the Israeli announcement that they were going to be withdrawing several thousand troops [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=287.46s)]
*  from Gaza was being read as a shift to what the US had been pushing for, potentially a more targeted [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  war, more reliant on precision airstrikes, on special operations assaults inside of Gaza, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=296.26s)]
*  outside of Gaza, something these Israelis have done for a long time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=301.46s)]
*  So that's the hope, but you can't get away from the fact that these 21,000 plus reported [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=305.86s)]
*  killed by the Gaza Health Ministry, the fact the UN is saying that with aid delivery so [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=312.58s)]
*  restricted that half of Gaza's 2.2 million people are at the risk of starvation at this point. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=317.06s)]
*  More than 85% of Gaza's people have been displaced and these people are crowded into ever smaller [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=322.18s)]
*  places. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=327.14s)]
*  So yes, the US may be getting its way finally with the Israelis, but it doesn't mitigate [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  what's happened before in that terrible suffering. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=332.34s)]
*  And maybe these ways are shifting to a new phase, but when you add to all this other disruption in [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  the region, can you contain a wider war? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=342.58000000000004s)]
*  05 Well, and it's also been reported that Al-Ururi had played an important role in the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=342.98s)]
*  hostage releases that have taken place to date. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=347.38s)]
*  There are still a number of hostages at this point and it's not exactly clear where they are, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=349.62s)]
*  presumably in hard to reach parts of southern Gaza, but it does raise the question of whether [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  that is a stalled process and how much of a process is involved on that front. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=359.85999999999996s)]
*  While as you say, the humanitarian situation only gets worse and more challenging and then [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=364.58s)]
*  you have all sorts of ongoing discussion about what to do with this large, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=368.82s)]
*  increasingly displaced population and that's raising a lot of ire as well in terms of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  reports that some officials would like to transport them out of the region [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=377.46s)]
*  to another country and so forth. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=380.82s)]
*  06 Well, there had been hope a few weeks back when we were last speaking that Bill Burns, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=382.17999999999995s)]
*  the director of central intelligence had been back in the region hoping that there'd be some [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=387.54s)]
*  sort of pause and another group of swaps of hostages potentially, but this strike on Al-Ururi [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=391.86s)]
*  has raised fears that it was going to impede any further talks and leading to a pause of fighting [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=398.82s)]
*  and freeing of hostages. That was basically the readout of Washington in the last few days. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=403.38s)]
*  07 On the issue of the Houthis that you mentioned, Carla, it does seem to be kind of interesting [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=407.62s)]
*  whereas Hezbollah does very much seem to be following Iran's bidding on restraint in its [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=412.74s)]
*  response to Israel's war in Gaza, the Houthis are not. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=418.26000000000005s)]
*  08 Until now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  08 Until now. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=422.5s)]
*  08 Until now. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=423.22s)]
*  08 Yeah. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  08 Right. The Houthis have not though. The Houthis who possess some pretty impressive firepower [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  themselves have created havoc in the Red Sea and global supply chains in general, forcing the US [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=428.74s)]
*  to get more heavily involved. Do we get a sense that the Houthis are their own operators or are [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=434.82000000000005s)]
*  they kind of sort of plausible deniability in their role also serves Iran's purposes? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=439.22s)]
*  09 That I don't know. I certainly don't know as much about the Houthi leadership as we have [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=443.86s)]
*  been watching Hezbollah for such a long time. I do think it was quite interesting that there were [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=448.58000000000004s)]
*  dozen countries that were issuing this warning to the Houthis, but it was also really quite [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  carefully couched. It said you will bear consequences, but it still didn't say military [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=459.3s)]
*  consequences because there is this other equity which is nobody wants to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=464.18s)]
*  unleash the full war in Yemen again. So there's once again a careful balance that is there. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=468.26s)]
*  There is one other element that we need to be, I think, thinking about, which is sort of the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=473.86s)]
*  politics of all of this inside of Israel. There's a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to get these [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=477.7s)]
*  hostages released, the ones who one hopes are surviving. And you have to balance this of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  wanting to go after Hamas leaders wherever they are. Netanyahu is certainly feeling very [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=490.02s)]
*  vulnerable politically. There's a recent poll that came out that showed that only 15% of Israelis [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=494.34s)]
*  want Bibi to remain in power once the war against Hamas ends. And the high court struck down this [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=500.26s)]
*  judicial reform that we spent so much time talking about before. So Bibi has to weigh the need to get [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=505.78s)]
*  the hostages out, the need to show some sort of progress in this. And he's also been feeling a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=512.34s)]
*  lot of pressure from the Americans. So this is quite the stew. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=516.58s)]
*  CB And we will continue to track this. It's become a bit of a tracking exercise in this podcast, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=519.5400000000001s)]
*  I think, Carla. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=524.6600000000001s)]
*  CS Yes, a really frightening one, quite grim. So Bob, let's talk about something happier. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=525.22s)]
*  Las Vegas, no. The Consumer Electronics Show. This is the world's largest consumer tech trade show. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=532.9000000000001s)]
*  Companies, Intel, Samsung, pretty much everybody else showing off their latest products. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=540.9000000000001s)]
*  This is not open to the public, although lots of journalists get to go. And it doesn't take us long [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=545.38s)]
*  to hear about all the cool stuff they want to sell us. So what are going to be this year's really [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=550.58s)]
*  cool items? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=554.9s)]
*  CB Well, we should first mention on the scale of this, because Vegas does everything in a big [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=555.7s)]
*  scale. But this, as the CES show organizers have touted, this is one of the biggest, if not the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=560.42s)]
*  biggest, internationally attended event that the US hosts on an annual basis. Maybe just competing [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=565.86s)]
*  only with, say, quadrennial Olympics in the event the US hosts one of those. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=570.66s)]
*  CS Bigger than Comic Con? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=574.5s)]
*  CB Well, that would be a great one to compare it to, because Comic Con's actually taking on a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=575.6999999999999s)]
*  life of its own. So hold that thought. We'll do a Comic Con discussion down the road, Carla. But [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=580.42s)]
*  the point is it's enormous. It's highly sought after. The tech world goes to this because it [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=585.2199999999999s)]
*  has gained a reputation over five or six decades of being a place where the big, shiny new things [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=590.66s)]
*  that will transform the tech world, but also the consumer world, tend to appear, including one [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=597.38s)]
*  that's dear to my heart, which was the introduction of Pong, the great game that Atari released in the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=602.74s)]
*  mid-70s that transformed television screens and won Christmas for myself, and looks laughably slow [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=607.46s)]
*  and ponderous these days. But the point is that it's where VCRs, it's where DVDs, all sorts of tech [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=614.1s)]
*  that's supposed to be getting polished and ready for distribution in the public gets turned out [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=622.82s)]
*  and shown off. And so this year, the big thing on everybody's lips, as it has been, is AI. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=627.3s)]
*  And one manifestation of that will be something that Microsoft is teasing out. Microsoft is adding [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=633.8599999999999s)]
*  a button to its Windows 11 PCs that is dedicated to its AI assistant, Co-Pilot. And the button [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=639.06s)]
*  will be unveiled at the CES show in Vegas. You click on this button and it's going to be an AI [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=645.6999999999999s)]
*  powered chat bot that helps you research, draft text, create images, prepare your podcast scripts, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=650.42s)]
*  maybe carlisle. Turn your ideas into songs even is one of the touts for it. But it's the whole idea [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=655.62s)]
*  of the year of the AI PC as Microsoft officials are calling it. And that's going to be something [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=661.0600000000001s)]
*  that's rolled out. But it's also AI is going to be demonstrated in cars, on other mobile devices [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=666.58s)]
*  like scooters and cameras, television, of course. And there'll be a product where you access a chat [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=673.0600000000001s)]
*  GPT Q&A service integrated into all sorts of smart tech, all sorts of smart appliances. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=679.14s)]
*  I should focus on cars because that's a particularly big instance. This isn't the auto show and the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=685.54s)]
*  auto shows themselves will be featuring this in much more detail. But there's a large presence, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=690.18s)]
*  it's something like 300 Auto and other companies that deal with mobile products like scooters, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=694.74s)]
*  BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Kia and Hyundai are going to be showing off what they have in terms of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=699.78s)]
*  EVs and other whiz bang things that are going to be on display. Health tech is going to be a [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=706.1s)]
*  really big deal, whether it's the AI capabilities in health tech or otherwise, but just in terms of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=711.38s)]
*  tracking personal health, something that many of us have gotten accustomed to, whether it's just [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=717.62s)]
*  tracking our steps or heart rate or whatever, there's going to be added capabilities, apparently [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=721.14s)]
*  demonstrated in these technologies to help older people, people with disabilities and so on. So [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=726.82s)]
*  it's an event where hype is expected and you cannot hype enough, but also sometimes around [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=732.26s)]
*  the horizon type things that might not be ready yet, robots performing wild tricks, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=737.78s)]
*  but these are robots that are not going to be ready for prime time for maybe a number of years [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=742.3399999999999s)]
*  still. And then lots of startup firms, I should mention as a final note, thousands of them [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=746.18s)]
*  attend this to strut some of their stuff. Sometimes they get gobbled up by the bigger companies as a [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=750.5799999999999s)]
*  result of what they demonstrate. It's all to say it's an important kickoff event on a year where [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=754.8199999999999s)]
*  tech is going to again be featured very importantly, especially the AI. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=760.18s)]
*  Are you struck by this sort of huge gap? I mean, just a few months ago, we had [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=763.8599999999999s)]
*  all these AI chiefs warning that this was going to be an extinction level event if we didn't use [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=768.8199999999999s)]
*  it carefully. And now suddenly here we are in Las Vegas and everything you turn to, I'm going to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=774.5s)]
*  have a blender that's got AI in it. My car is going to be smarter than I am in a few years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=779.4599999999999s)]
*  Isn't there just a huge gap here? This thing is just racing forward so quickly. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=784.66s)]
*  I think it's because AI has become this amorphous term. AI was already influencing our lives and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=788.66s)]
*  moving forward. It was just the year ago launch of the chat GPT and the generative AI, which [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=792.9s)]
*  spurred all sorts of discussions about the looming self-awareness potentially of AI and all sorts of [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=797.78s)]
*  things, including launching weapons systems perhaps or turning against the human masters. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=804.0999999999999s)]
*  I think regulation is something lurking in the background of all of the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=808.5s)]
*  GWIZ stuff going on in Vegas. And so we'll have to keep an eye on that, the extent to which that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=812.5799999999999s)]
*  gets discussed at all. It's still out there. There's a lot of concern on another issue that [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=816.5s)]
*  you and I have talked about a lot and we'll be talking about a lot on this podcast, which is the [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=821.46s)]
*  upcoming series of elections around the world. It's an enormous election year. And there's a lot [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=824.42s)]
*  of concern about AI being a source of off the shelf disinformation by just about anybody who [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=828.98s)]
*  wants to create phony press briefings or phony statements. All sorts of things that used to be [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=835.38s)]
*  the purview of companies or bigger organizations or governments are now seemingly available to [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=841.3s)]
*  individuals who can use nifty AI technology to cause disruption. So I think that's in [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=847.3s)]
*  particular going to be something front and center for the world's governments to be dealing with on [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=852.8199999999999s)]
*  the regulation front. That's a departure from what's going on in Vegas, but it is again, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=856.5s)]
*  I think a backdrop issue. So last year at this meeting, this trade show, whatever it is, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=861.54s)]
*  it was all about blockchain and the metaverse. Nobody's talking about that anymore. I wonder [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=868.3399999999999s)]
*  whether the Facebook company now known as Meta is going to change its name again to AI. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=872.8199999999999s)]
*  Does that sort of wonder whether or not our enthusiasms should also be examined? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=878.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point. Where is blockchain now? It still seems to be a pretty [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=883.38s)]
*  important way of dealing with cryptocurrencies and so forth, but it just seems like a remote [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=887.6999999999999s)]
*  thing now when we talk about AI, when we talk about smart machines and smart devices, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=893.22s)]
*  and as well as the EV revolution and how far electric vehicles are going to be able to perform [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=897.62s)]
*  and impress people and impress governments, local governments, national governments, whatever, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=903.0600000000001s)]
*  in terms of embracing that. That gets us into a whole other discussion, Carla, about energy and [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=907.38s)]
*  energy transformations. But you're right. I think with all of the things that have emerged at CES [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=911.86s)]
*  in the past and gone on to be celebrated, you know, Blu-ray and DVDs, we should note that Best Buy is [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=916.1s)]
*  announced. They are no longer going to be selling either of those. Their time in the sunshine is [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=922.9000000000001s)]
*  now waning and people are ready for different tech. In terms of what we haven't anticipated yet, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=926.9000000000001s)]
*  that's also going to be kind of intriguing. What comes out of this that nobody saw coming? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=932.9000000000001s)]
*  Stay tuned. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=936.26s)]
*  So they're not handing out free leftover Google Glasses anytime soon. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=936.9000000000001s)]
*  I would love to have a swag bag from the CES show, Carla. I really would. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=940.26s)]
*  Well, I want to stay in the United States, Carla, and take us back to the reality of [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=944.74s)]
*  the swamp, as they say, or as some people call Washington. Both chambers of the US Congress will [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=949.62s)]
*  be back in session. There are already signs of intensifying discussions over matters in and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=954.4200000000001s)]
*  around the funding of the government. There's looming deadlines this month and early next month. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=960.66s)]
*  One of the issues that permeates is US border security as well. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=965.54s)]
*  So is Congress divided as ever as we kick off a major US election year? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=969.0600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=975.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay. Well, that's good. We're done with that. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=976.1s)]
*  We're done. So here's an interesting and depressing fact. Last year, only 34 bills were signed into [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=977.6999999999999s)]
*  law, and that's the smallest number in more than 70 years. So when Congress comes back to town on [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=985.06s)]
*  January 8th, it's going to have an enormous amount of work to do, but the chances that it's going to [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=990.9799999999999s)]
*  be any more productive, I fear, are not great. We've got the same deep partisan divisions at play, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=996.26s)]
*  and as are the same ideological divisions within the GOP that paralyze so much action. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1003.46s)]
*  All of that exacerbated by the fact that it's a presidential election year. So if anybody's [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1009.46s)]
*  going to be posturing, and it's not just a presidential election year, every House member [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1014.02s)]
*  and a third of the Senate is up for election. So what's the chance we're going to get 34 through? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1018.82s)]
*  That's all that is the context, as we like to say. So what are the top issues to watch? First, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1026.1000000000001s)]
*  whether they can head off a government shutdown. There's actually two deadlines. The first deadline [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1031.46s)]
*  is January 19th, when the money is supposed to run out at the Department of Agriculture, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1036.18s)]
*  Energy, Water, Bills, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, and HUD. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1041.38s)]
*  And then there's a deadline on February 2nd, when funding for Defense, Labor, Homeland Security, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1047.54s)]
*  and Health and Human Services runs out. And you recall we came close to a shutdown twice last [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1052.1000000000001s)]
*  year. Then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted after he broke with his party's hardliners, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1058.1s)]
*  who were demanding he go back on the budget deal negotiated with the White House and make [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1063.06s)]
*  far deeper cuts in social programs. And he decided it was not politically sound or good for the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1067.54s)]
*  country to go ahead with the shutdown. And he agreed to a continuing resolution, which temporarily [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1072.8999999999999s)]
*  fund federal agencies at then current levels. And this bill was passed in October with Democratic [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1078.98s)]
*  support. And what happened? McCarthy lost his job. And then his successor, Mike Johnson, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1084.82s)]
*  made the same decision in November. And again, he had to rely on Democratic votes to keep the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1089.86s)]
*  government running, which is how we got these current deadlines. Johnson could make the same [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1094.58s)]
*  decision again when they come back, but his honeymoon is likely over. And his right wing [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1098.8999999999999s)]
*  caucus could try to oust him, just like McCarthy, if he decides to compromise. He's caught in this [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1104.1799999999998s)]
*  political situation in which nobody wants to shut down, at least nobody who makes a good, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1109.94s)]
*  sound political calculation in an election year. People may hate government until they start losing [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1114.5800000000002s)]
*  their checks. And there's not a lot of time to make that decision on Johnson's part or on any [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1118.98s)]
*  of the politicians' part, because the first deadline is 11 days after they come back. So [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1123.6200000000001s)]
*  that makes it all incredibly contentious. So that's the shutdown issue. That clock is tick, tick, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1128.5800000000002s)]
*  ticking. And then of course, we've got the Ukraine funding issue. And that is not just Ukraine [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1133.6200000000001s)]
*  funding, Israel funding Taiwan. And that's all caught up with the immigration debate. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1139.54s)]
*  Ukraine, as we've talked about a lot, desperately needs the aid. Just after Christmas, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1143.94s)]
*  the Pentagon announced it was sending its last package of military support. And the mood on the [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1147.46s)]
*  Hill among Republicans in particular, shift radically against Ukraine. And the only way [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1151.46s)]
*  they're going to get that money through is some sort of a deal. In the Senate, they've been talking [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1156.1s)]
*  for weeks and weeks and weeks. Democrats are open to some changes, but they're adamantly opposed to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1160.98s)]
*  radically expanding the deportations, particularly the Republicans in the House are demanding. So [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1167.6200000000001s)]
*  we'll see whether or not, even if they can get a deal through in the Senate. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1172.18s)]
*  Mike Johnson, the new speaker, took more than 60 members yesterday, Wednesday of his caucus to [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1175.8600000000001s)]
*  Eagle Pass, Texas to highlight the border crisis. And he's insisting that they're not going to [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1180.5s)]
*  expect anything other than this HR2 that they passed. And that would insist on construction [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1185.8600000000001s)]
*  of a border wall, completing that, the remain in Mexico practice, keeping migrants, seeking asylum. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1191.14s)]
*  In detention facilities, expurgated deportation, including of unaccompanied children, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1196.26s)]
*  e-verify back and criminalizing visa overstays, really hardline Trump policies, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1201.3s)]
*  which the Democrats say they'll never accept. So yes, that puts it in pretty stark terms then. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1205.94s)]
*  And just on the border side of things, that visit by Johnson with the delegation at the border, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1212.1s)]
*  according to reports seemed to be particularly interesting because it was occurring amid a real [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1217.22s)]
*  surge in migration across the border, including some people visible from where the delegation was [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1221.78s)]
*  appearing, seeking to get into the country. Although it was pretty quiet yesterday, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1227.3s)]
*  I think, during the visit, quieter than I think they hoped for the cameras. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1232.42s)]
*  It wasn't maybe the photo op they wanted. Partly, I guess, Mexico's been taking steps to try to [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1236.8999999999999s)]
*  interrupt some of the so-called caravans and do its part to restrict the flows. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1241.3s)]
*  Well, that said, listen, the numbers are huge. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1246.02s)]
*  The numbers are huge. And there's a broken system that speaks to years of political dysfunction [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1247.86s)]
*  and doing something serious about the country's border and migration policies that has to be [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1253.6999999999998s)]
*  dealt with at some point. If the air ever clears on this issue for both sides to sit down and work [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1258.5s)]
*  out something, they really need to. It's something that is being grappled with worldwide. It's [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1264.1s)]
*  particularly acute in the US at the moment, certainly. But European states are also, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1268.9799999999998s)]
*  they are taking a harder line on migrant policies. You've seen it really happening around the world [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1274.02s)]
*  wherever there are havens and there are growing numbers of migrants, and it seems to be virtually [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1278.98s)]
*  everywhere. This is becoming a fraud issue. So this is a year of elections. This is also a year [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1282.5800000000002s)]
*  of migration. There's definitely a sort of a crossover on the two that we should keep an eye [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1287.38s)]
*  out for. But I would just add on your point about the US budget shutdown. It also doesn't do anything [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1291.22s)]
*  to the ongoing concerns about the US political stature and the US image abroad. I had good fortune [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1296.42s)]
*  to travel in the Czech Republic during the recent holiday. And there's a lot of concern about the [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1303.46s)]
*  US. There's still a lot of Ukrainian flags flying in places like Prague and support for Ukraine, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1307.14s)]
*  but there's a lot of questions about what is going on in the US and what is going on [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1311.6200000000001s)]
*  in Washington in particular. And I don't think we're starting the year with any sort of clear [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1315.7s)]
*  sense of where this is all going. No, the fact that US dysfunction, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1320.18s)]
*  the idea that we can't fund our own government is not a good luck. And certainly this profound [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1324.18s)]
*  concern that the leader of the transatlantic alliance is going to bug out on funding Ukraine. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1329.86s)]
*  Yes, we have major immigration challenges and we have a dysfunctional system. And one would hope [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1336.34s)]
*  that we could finally develop sound immigration policy. But developing that in the midst of a [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1342.82s)]
*  presidential election and holding funding to Ukraine hostage or funding for the federal [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1348.8999999999999s)]
*  government hostage is probably not the environment to do it. And so Mike Johnson's got some really [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1354.58s)]
*  big decisions that he has to make and so do Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. This is a [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1360.82s)]
*  really challenging time. So Bob, let's move to the audience figure of the week. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1365.54s)]
*  This is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1372.82s)]
*  Instagram story. And this week our audience selected South Korea opposition leader is stabbed. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1377.06s)]
*  What do we know about Lee Jae Myung's condition? And is this a random crazy or does it say something [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1384.58s)]
*  even more disturbing about the state of South Korean politics? Well, that last part in particular [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1390.4199999999998s)]
*  is resonating because this is occurring just a few months ahead of parliamentary elections in South [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1395.62s)]
*  Korea. But first regarding Mr. Lee, at last report that I saw Mr. Lee is now out of intensive care [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1400.26s)]
*  after having surgery at Seoul National University and had been wounded near his jugular vein, which [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1407.3s)]
*  is always very concerning. And it was by a person, 66 year old person named Kim Jin Sung, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1412.66s)]
*  who's been described as a real estate agent who has admitted an intent to kill Mr. Lee. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1419.8600000000001s)]
*  Now South Korea has had political violence in the past. It has had attacks against prominent [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1424.8200000000002s)]
*  opposition figures in the past, but this is one of the worst in about two decades to hit the country. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1429.5400000000002s)]
*  And as I said, it's happening in the run up to parliamentary elections. And we should say Lee was [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1434.8200000000002s)]
*  a very close second in the elections that took place for president and had intention to run again [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1440.66s)]
*  in 2027. We're waiting to see what comes out about the person involved and about any sort of other [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1447.0600000000002s)]
*  fomenting of political violence. For South Korea itself, it's dealing at a time of its own growing [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1453.46s)]
*  polarization. The elections that resulted in his loss further polarized the country. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1459.14s)]
*  The peninsula of Korea is going through a particularly tense moment. North Korea is [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1464.02s)]
*  continuing to ratchet up its missile capabilities, its nuclear saber rattling. There's expected to be [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1468.74s)]
*  another nuclear test not too long from the North, but also making noises about its posture towards [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1474.58s)]
*  the South. That is always very disturbing as well. And there have been alternating administrations [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1480.66s)]
*  in South Korea that have taken different attacks against the North in terms of trying to be more [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1486.98s)]
*  accommodating and trying to be more hard line, neither of which seemed to have worked too [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1490.74s)]
*  effectively with Kim Jong-un. But still in all, this type of political violence in the South, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1496.66s)]
*  in what has been a very robust democracy, is very disturbing. And it also sets an ominous model for [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1502.02s)]
*  other elections that are playing out this year in large democracies around the world. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1509.38s)]
*  And we used to think that we were the country that had political assassinations. And this seems to be, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1512.74s)]
*  unfortunately, we saw Japan, other places seem to be having this problem too. Other democracies [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1521.78s)]
*  seem to be having this problem too. And we seem to be going through a really frightening, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1527.9399999999998s)]
*  not only polarized, but increasingly violent in more and more democratic countries. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1532.4199999999998s)]
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it's worth noting that the current [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1537.1399999999999s)]
*  president, Yoon Suk-yool, came out with a statement strongly condemning the attack, and that was seen [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1539.9399999999998s)]
*  as important. And that South Korean society is trying to rally around some sort of a strong [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1544.98s)]
*  stance against this attack, against political violence, and towards a shared political culture. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1551.46s)]
*  But still in all, there are big differences in worldview. And again, seeing something like this [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1556.18s)]
*  play out in a country like South Korea at this moment in time is certainly quite disturbing. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1561.8600000000001s)]
*  And we'll just have to see how the country handles it. What other intel might emerge on the attacker, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1566.74s)]
*  and whether or not the country can mount a campaign, an election campaign that is free and fair. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1572.6599999999999s)]
*  And also, we haven't yet heard a great deal about any sort of disinformation campaign and meddling [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1578.02s)]
*  from outside countries, whether it's North Korea or others. But that's a concern as well, because [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1582.82s)]
*  these open, transparent democracies that run these elections are vulnerable to that kind of thing as [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1587.6999999999998s)]
*  well. Well, that's our look at the world next week as 2024 gets underway. Here are some other [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEctu-tadig&t=1592.74s)]
