# World Reacts to Biden Withdrawal, Summer Olympics Begin, Netanyahu Visits Washington, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY)
*  In the coming week, the global response to President Biden stepping down, the world comes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=0.0s)]
*  to Paris for the Summer Olympics, what's next in the Gaza war after Netanyahu's visit [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=4.7s)]
*  to Washington, and the future of two American journalists sentenced in Russia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=8.9s)]
*  It's July 25th, 2024 in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=27.54s)]
*  And I'm Karl Anne Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=28.54s)]
*  Carla, lots to talk about given that rundown, but let's start here in the U.S. where the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=29.54s)]
*  news has been particularly fast and furious with President Biden dropping out of the presidential [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=34.74s)]
*  race and Vice President Kamala Harris well on her way to clinching the nomination for [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=38.6s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=43.06s)]
*  What has been the global reaction to this handoff? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  And the world does not stop for American politics, by the way. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=47.82s)]
*  How do you think Biden will exercise U.S. leadership in his remaining six months or [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=51.14s)]
*  so in office? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=55.16s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken had reminded his senior staff earlier this week that Biden [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=56.88s)]
*  still has one-eighth of his term to go. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  So lots to lay out there for you, Carla. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=63.86s)]
*  You know that Blinken quote is really telling because you can just imagine what it's like [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=66.0s)]
*  in pretty much every department right now of people. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Stay focused, folks. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=76.64s)]
*  It's not over with. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=77.76s)]
*  We still have a lot to do here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=78.76s)]
*  So among allies, what we're seeing is a sense of relief after what was really barely [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  contained panic at the NATO summit. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=87.08s)]
*  When Trump win with the expected chaos to follow seemed all but inevitable. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=89.28s)]
*  There's no guarantee Harris can win, but it looks like more of a horse race. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=94.44s)]
*  But nobody's going to stop filling up sandbags for a Trump return, certainly in Europe. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=100.22s)]
*  Europeans and Asians have actually seen Harris quite a lot. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  Vice Presidents, Bob, you know, often get relegated to funeral duty. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  She's done a lot more than that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=113.2s)]
*  She's led U.S. delegations at the Munich Security Conference at Rishi Sunak's AI Summit at [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=114.64s)]
*  the Ukraine Peace Conference, the one we talked about in Switzerland, at ASEAN at the COP [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=119.92s)]
*  climate conference in Dubai last year. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  But allies are certainly less certain about her credentials on foreign policy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  That's not surprising for a vice president, and it's not surprising given her background. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=132.76s)]
*  She was a prosecutor and a state attorney general, and not surprising given the comparison [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=136.36s)]
*  who spent most of his career working on foreign policy issues. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=142.48s)]
*  And there has been some very sniffy and frankly sexist comments, not just here in the United [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=146.88s)]
*  States, but also abroad. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=151.0s)]
*  Who is Kamala Harris? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=153.48s)]
*  And perhaps the sniffiest one reported came from Isabel Schnabel, an executive board member [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  of the European Central Bank who was caught in a hot mic in February. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=159.92s)]
*  She said, I don't even know her because she's been so invisible. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=162.56s)]
*  Really hard to say she's been so invisible given all the summits she's been at. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=166.2s)]
*  It's true. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  It's really hard to figure out what is a Kamala Harris foreign policy, but she's a vice president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=171.92s)]
*  So, so far, what we have to predict is it's going to be continuity, but she's going to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  have to decide in the coming weeks how much she wants to separate herself from Biden and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  on what issues. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=186.6s)]
*  And that is always a challenge for a sitting vice president running for office. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=188.16s)]
*  Her advisors have been described as foreign policy traditionalists. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=192.0s)]
*  And her national security advisor, Phil Gordon, is a Europe expert with a lot of experience [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=195.2s)]
*  in the Middle East and a former colleague of ours here at CFR. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=200.28s)]
*  If I were going to predict continued strong support for Ukraine, continue what Biden's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=203.2s)]
*  economic and security initiatives in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=208.72s)]
*  She has a history from when she was a senator being a trade skeptic, pretty strong commitment [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=211.68s)]
*  on human rights. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=216.24s)]
*  And the area where there's been the most daylight, such as it is between Harris and Biden, has [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=218.2s)]
*  been on Gaza. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=222.76s)]
*  And even that is limited, although it could prove to be politically significant. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=223.96s)]
*  She was rhetorically ahead of the president criticizing Israel for Gaza, and most notably [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=228.64s)]
*  in the civil rights speech in Selma, Alabama in March, where she called for an immediate [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=233.76s)]
*  ceasefire, something that Biden himself got to. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  And she really has been highly critical then and subsequently for Israel for creating what [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=241.38s)]
*  she called a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=245.76s)]
*  And that perceived difference, and particularly that sense of empathy that she's expressed [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=248.98s)]
*  for people in Gaza, has already garnered her praise from many of the officials who resigned [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  from the administration and some cautious, if not optimism, a willingness to listen from [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=259.82s)]
*  political groups, including these people who were voting not committed during the primaries. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=266.94s)]
*  They seem willing to listen to her. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=272.82s)]
*  Whether they're going to vote for her, we'll see, but much more willing to put aside their [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  fury at Biden. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=278.7s)]
*  We should also note that our colleague Linda Robinson has a new post up on her CFR blog [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=280.66s)]
*  about Kamala Harris, noting both the rarity of a woman candidate for president in the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  United States and why there are such obstacles in the way the US campaign is run, and also [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=289.38000000000005s)]
*  taking stock of what Kamala Harris has done in the foreign policy and national security [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=294.38000000000005s)]
*  sphere. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=298.86s)]
*  So check that out if you get a chance. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=299.86s)]
*  I think it is important to note, as you say, there is this sense that a Harris administration [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=301.22s)]
*  would have in broad strokes some of the continuity of the Biden administration. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=307.76s)]
*  Our colleague Charlie Kupchan will have a piece up on the website later today, kind [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=311.48s)]
*  of walking through how to look at the Biden presidency and its foreign policy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  He makes a point in his piece about also the importance of the Biden domestic policy being [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=319.38s)]
*  a through line there in terms of being willing to use industrial policy, even protectionism [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=324.72s)]
*  to nurture US competitive industries. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=330.02s)]
*  I would think that would also continue through with the Harris administration as well. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=333.36s)]
*  I think the bigger question is what you alluded to at the beginning, which is something that's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=337.92s)]
*  been noted repeatedly, which is that you have, if you do have this sort of through line in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=342.48s)]
*  foreign policy, you now have a figure, a younger, more vigorous figure who can debate these [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=346.72s)]
*  points, who can challenge Donald Trump, a Republican candidate, in a debate more assertively [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=351.86s)]
*  on these points and not sort of back down or not be seen as too frail to push back. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=358.32s)]
*  So I think it's a race that's definitely got adrenaline injected into it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=363.48s)]
*  We've seen the Democratic base fired up. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=367.68s)]
*  You see the Republicans in their own way fired up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=369.32s)]
*  You're going to see the full panoply of social media and media brought to bear. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=372.32s)]
*  We're already seeing a media campaign on the Harris side that stepped up its message. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=376.16s)]
*  We've seen Republicans, again, going after Harris as they went after Biden. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  So hang on, but also potentially we have a chance to have some of the actual subject [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=386.12s)]
*  matter areas really argued at least more vigorously back and forth than we have had unexpectedly [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=391.12s)]
*  this summer given the Biden position on a lot of these areas. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=397.4s)]
*  We were talking before this, there's this new Kamala Harris ad out there with Beyonce's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=401.76s)]
*  freedom in the background, which is pretty extraordinary and quite powerful. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=407.02s)]
*  Certainly a different face from what the Biden campaign was doing and certainly an enormously [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=411.76s)]
*  different face from what the Trump campaign has out there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=415.4s)]
*  Beyonce, Kid Rock, pretty different contrast out there. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  And yes, they're going after her, not just the way they went after Biden, but there's [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=421.0s)]
*  a lot of sexism and a lot of racism already floating out there on the internet and some [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  of it out of people's mouths. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=427.44s)]
*  So this is going to be a pretty intense campaign. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=429.0s)]
*  So what about Biden? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=433.14s)]
*  He has Tony Blinken said, it's not over yet. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=434.56s)]
*  And all presidents spend a lot of time thinking about their legacy. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=438.76s)]
*  No more so is when this clock is ticking down. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=444.08s)]
*  When I covered Clinton in 2000, I remember there was this discussion about whether they're [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=447.64s)]
*  going to devote his last remaining bandwidth to trying to negotiate a deal with North Korea [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=451.36s)]
*  or an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=457.8s)]
*  And they sent Madeleine Albright to Pyongyang and Clinton instead chose to stay in Washington [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=461.68s)]
*  to focus on trying to broker this last minute peace agreement between Yasser Arafat and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=465.92s)]
*  Ehud Barak. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=470.68s)]
*  Neither panned out, but limited bandwidth, limited amount of time and pretty big decisions [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=472.12s)]
*  to make. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=477.4s)]
*  Biden and his aides are already listing their goals for the last six months. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=478.4s)]
*  Biden mentioned Supreme Court reform and several other things last night. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=481.64s)]
*  But we know that for Biden, the foreign policy space is where he's devoted most of his career. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=486.4s)]
*  And if I had to bet, he's going to really want to focus on bolstering Ukraine and NATO [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=491.16s)]
*  and helping seal this Israel Hamas ceasefire agreement and possibly pushing forward this [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=495.06s)]
*  bigger grand bargain, the Israel-Saudi deal. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=500.76s)]
*  All of these are really major heavy lifts. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=503.52s)]
*  But things he certainly, if he has the energy, he's going to try and push through. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=506.48s)]
*  And no more money for Ukraine, but lots of things he could do if he's out there and could [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=511.2s)]
*  help the allies, could help Kamala Harris if he does it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=516.24s)]
*  Polling shows Americans still want to support Ukraine and have a positive view of NATO. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=519.16s)]
*  So any attention he draws to those fights could make it a lot easier for her and potentially [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=523.38s)]
*  Trump-proof if Trump is elected. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=529.04s)]
*  Wider grand bargain on Gaza. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=532.12s)]
*  If Biden takes the lead and actually makes some progress on Gaza, certainly make it a [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=534.08s)]
*  lot easier for Kamala on the campaign trail. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=538.16s)]
*  So lots of things to look for, lots of storylines, Carly, certainly. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=540.64s)]
*  Bob, let's go to France. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=544.28s)]
*  Oh, if only we could, where the summer Olympics are kicking off. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=545.96s)]
*  Paris and the French government are eager to show they could put on a fabulous event. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=551.32s)]
*  They're especially proud of that one and a half billion dollar cleanup of the Seine. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=554.96s)]
*  And a show that is also safe, even at a time of huge uncertainty over who's going to ultimately [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  govern France alongside Macron following snap elections earlier this month. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=563.54s)]
*  The preparations include the country's largest peacetime deployment of security personnel. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=568.64s)]
*  And the games are taking place in the midst of two major conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=573.08s)]
*  which has interestingly had an effect on what athletes are attending. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=577.76s)]
*  Are we going to have any time to focus on the competition amid all these other dramas? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=581.8s)]
*  I would say at the end of the day, yes, but it will be a crowded space, certainly. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=586.92s)]
*  And again, we should also note these are the first Olympics coming out of the COVID influenced [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=592.9599999999999s)]
*  Olympics, both the winter ones in China and the summer ones in Tokyo, which were delayed [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=598.12s)]
*  by a year. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=602.24s)]
*  And it's not to say that COVID isn't out there. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=603.4799999999999s)]
*  There's actually a pretty big strain that's running through Europe. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=605.28s)]
*  Anecdotally, of people who've traveled recently there and came down with the case of COVID. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=608.88s)]
*  So that could flare up. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=612.92s)]
*  But I think it's going to be important to sort of lay out the security landscape because [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=614.84s)]
*  it's, I think it'll be evident even as we try to take in the spectacle of opening night. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=621.4s)]
*  And it's going to be a different spectacle. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=625.78s)]
*  It looks like it's the first opening ceremony that is not taking place in a stadium in modern [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=627.12s)]
*  Olympic history. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=632.84s)]
*  It is going to be an opening ceremony taking place along a four mile stretch of the Seine, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=634.08s)]
*  which winds its way through Paris very picturesquely as anybody who's been to Paris knows. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=638.08s)]
*  There's major security along that route. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=642.6s)]
*  Apparently hundreds of thousands of spectators will be able to see the dozens of boats and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=645.2s)]
*  with floating athletes on them. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=649.64s)]
*  The US delegation will include flag bearer LeBron James representing the men and Coco [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=651.64s)]
*  Gough, a tennis player representing the women among others. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=656.52s)]
*  So it's going to be quite something. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=660.64s)]
*  So I think there's going to be a great deal of interest. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=661.72s)]
*  I think the coverage by the way, starts in US Eastern time around 1 30 and there'll be [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=663.4s)]
*  a big recap production at 7 30 for those tuning in and those relying on this podcast to tune [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=668.28s)]
*  in. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=673.04s)]
*  But in any event, security though, something along the order of 75,000 police officers, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=674.04s)]
*  soldiers and private security guards will be involved from the French side to try to [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=679.8s)]
*  maintain security. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=684.64s)]
*  Particularly there's a mandate to forbid drones from being used anywhere near the events and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=687.0799999999999s)]
*  the ceremonies. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=693.12s)]
*  There's a lot of concern about the capability of drones as we've seen in fields of combat [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=694.12s)]
*  certainly. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=699.76s)]
*  Even though there are plenty of amateurs who would love to get their camera mounted drones [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=700.76s)]
*  in there and getting photos, all of that is banned and they are being really strict about [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=704.12s)]
*  it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=708.48s)]
*  In terms of the events, there's always a new event. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=709.48s)]
*  This year the new event is called breaking. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=711.96s)]
*  It is breakdance as a sport. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=714.84s)]
*  We have seen dance and rhythmic gymnastics and other things enter their way into sport [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=716.84s)]
*  or ice dancing I should say. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=721.34s)]
*  I'll just have to describe it because I can't do it justice paraphrasing. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=722.62s)]
*  It is going to be quote, characterized by acrobatic movements, stylized footwork and [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=726.6600000000001s)]
*  the key role played by the GJ and the MC master ceremonies during the break battles according [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=730.5s)]
*  to the Paris Olympic Committee website. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=736.1s)]
*  So that is something to check out. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=739.62s)]
*  There are also new sports like surfing and skateboarding, which will be very interesting. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=741.0600000000001s)]
*  BMX biking will be taking place I believe in the Place de la Concorde or some part of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=745.34s)]
*  it that's been retrofitted. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=749.1s)]
*  These are obviously all geared towards attracting younger audiences and getting younger audiences [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=750.9s)]
*  locked in. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=756.0s)]
*  We've certainly seen with the Winter Olympics and the half pipe how much that has really [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=757.0s)]
*  generated enthusiasm on younger crowds as well as athletes. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=761.5s)]
*  So that will be very interesting to see. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  I'll just note on break dancing, I can't imagine it will match what I witnessed on New York [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=767.86s)]
*  streets in the late 80s, early 90s on certain pop-up performances both in subways and on [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=772.86s)]
*  the streets. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=778.3s)]
*  So we're interested to see what this evolution has yielded Carla and I love all the traditional [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=779.3s)]
*  sports too from swimming to track and field and so forth. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=784.26s)]
*  It's going to be in and of itself the competitions are going to be great, but you can't get away [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=787.66s)]
*  from the geopolitical moment we're in. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=792.24s)]
*  Just quickly because I want to get to the bigger geopolitical, but this may be linked, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=794.9399999999999s)]
*  all that security, is it that they're worried about terrorism? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=799.54s)]
*  Is it that it's just normal when you have that many people in any place or are they [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=803.3399999999999s)]
*  worried about protests because of the politics of France? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=807.66s)]
*  Are they worried about the Russians doing something because of Ukraine? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=812.04s)]
*  What's the intelligence assessment about the threat potential here? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=815.78s)]
*  Yeah, a bit of all the above Carla. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=819.26s)]
*  First of all, let's start with Russia. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=821.78s)]
*  Russia and Belarus for that matter, but particularly Russia are going to have extremely trimmed [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=823.26s)]
*  down athletic teams going. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=828.3399999999999s)]
*  In fact, the Russian athletes will be under a neutral banner as they have been in various [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=830.62s)]
*  ways since the 2016 Rio games. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=834.78s)]
*  This is a consequence of a number of things, including the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=837.34s)]
*  Also previously to that is a legacy of doping among Russian athletes. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=843.38s)]
*  Russia which had a large 300 plus contingent in the Tokyo Olympics will have about 15 athletes [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=849.7s)]
*  from Russia taking part, which is a real come down for a country that performs extremely [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=855.3000000000001s)]
*  well and has always proudly stepped forth in the Olympics. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=859.5s)]
*  There's concern about a cyber attack emanating from Russia or affiliates, either directed [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=863.28s)]
*  at athletes at the Olympic venues or whatever. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=868.22s)]
*  Just keep an eye out for that. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=870.88s)]
*  Russia has great capabilities in that area. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=872.0s)]
*  More along the lines of actual terrorist attacks though, there's a great deal of concern about [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=875.0s)]
*  a group known as the Islamic State Khorasan, ISIS-K in shorthand. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=879.76s)]
*  This is a group that actually struck Russia earlier this year at a Moscow theater, killed [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=884.4s)]
*  139 theatergoers. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=890.12s)]
*  There's a lot of concern given what they call chatter about this group being active. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=892.04s)]
*  The German authorities were alert to them to warnings around the Euro 2024 football [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=896.64s)]
*  tournament which recently took place. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=901.68s)]
*  That is a concern. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=904.88s)]
*  France in the teens had a few incidents of terrorism as well. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=905.88s)]
*  They are very concerned about the surfacing of this. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=913.04s)]
*  It's all to say that they are on extreme alert for any sort of attack. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=917.42s)]
*  Maybe it's just protests or maybe it's something a little bit more serious. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=921.86s)]
*  They are on alert, none the same, to make sure that they tamp down any sort of actions. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=925.2s)]
*  The Israeli athletes, the Israeli contingent of 80 plus athletes are under special guard [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=930.42s)]
*  as they have been since the 72 Olympics where Israeli athletes were killed by the Black [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=935.46s)]
*  September terrorists. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=940.3000000000001s)]
*  Actually the Israeli soccer team played against Mali, a country that does not recognize Israel. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=942.1s)]
*  There was a lot of sort of overtones of concern and there were no major incidents. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=946.82s)]
*  We'll just have to keep on watching that given the high rate of concern over the ongoing [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=951.7600000000001s)]
*  war in Gaza. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=957.5600000000001s)]
*  The state of the war in Ukraine could potentially raise concern among athletes as well. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=959.6s)]
*  Ukrainians are sending a stripped down contingent on their own. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=964.84s)]
*  Again, a backdrop to what's seen as very creatively interesting staging of the games this year [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=968.0s)]
*  is the state of the world being in such upheaval, Carla. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=974.66s)]
*  Symbol of peace and very rarely in a world of peace. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  I'll note we have an interactive timeline up on our website that looks at the history [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=981.5s)]
*  of the modern games and politics as it frequently intercedes. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=986.76s)]
*  Some people are comparing this year in terms of global ferment to 1968. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=990.92s)]
*  The 1968 Mexico City games were certainly known for their iconic protest photos. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=995.16s)]
*  Take a look at that timeline to get a sense of how this has resurfaced through the years. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1001.5s)]
*  Carla, let's shift the talk back to Washington, D.C. where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1005.38s)]
*  Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress on Wednesday and is due to meet with President [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1011.14s)]
*  Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris today, Thursday, as we were taping this podcast. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1015.8199999999999s)]
*  He is then due to fly to Florida to meet with former President Trump on Friday. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1021.56s)]
*  Netanyahu himself has faced pretty strong criticism from opposition leaders both in [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1025.5s)]
*  Israel and the United States who see him as an obstacle to a ceasefire for hostages deal. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1029.84s)]
*  There was hope that this visit could shift Netanyahu and move negotiations ahead. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1035.2s)]
*  There are ceasefire negotiations ongoing. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1040.24s)]
*  Any sign that this is going to move forward? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1042.8s)]
*  First, let's some news and context since we haven't discussed the ceasefire negotiations [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1046.72s)]
*  in a while. Israeli negotiators were due to return to the table on Thursday, today in Gutter. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1052.0s)]
*  Everybody is reporting that a senior Israeli official said that's been delayed. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1059.3799999999999s)]
*  The delay is due to the postponement of Netanyahu's meeting with President Biden. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1064.26s)]
*  It was kicked back from Monday because of Biden's COVID. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1069.3s)]
*  The BB intends to, quote, discuss the emerging deal with the president to weigh how to proceed. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1072.86s)]
*  Then they'll go after that. Color me skeptical. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1078.3s)]
*  But let's see. Maybe that meeting will change things. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1081.6599999999999s)]
*  As for the status of the negotiations, the wires this morning were quoting a senior US [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1085.4s)]
*  official saying the negotiations are in closing stages. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1090.44s)]
*  But we've been hearing that for quite a while since this is a podcast in which we are quoting [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1094.04s)]
*  the pithy lines of Tony Blinken. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1098.2s)]
*  He said in Aspen, I think, last week that they were within the 10-yard line. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1099.96s)]
*  How many times have we said that before? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1104.76s)]
*  But let's hope that it's true right now. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1107.24s)]
*  The basic framework has reportedly been agreed on for weeks. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1109.16s)]
*  We're still on with the first phase, a six-week halt in fighting and the release of more than [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1113.22s)]
*  30 hostages and several hundred Palestinian prisoners. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1116.7s)]
*  But since then, Netanyahu's come up with a series of security demands, an inspection [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1120.9s)]
*  system to stop Hamas fighters from returning to the north of Gaza, another system for Ra'afah, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1125.4s)]
*  full control of the border with Egypt. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1130.5800000000002s)]
*  He insists that these security demands can only be extracted from Hamas through additional [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1133.5400000000002s)]
*  brute military pressure. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1138.5s)]
*  That's what we've been seeing even as these negotiations were supposedly within the 10-yard line. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1139.94s)]
*  Israel's defense minister, meanwhile, and the IDF leaders have been insisting increasingly [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1144.92s)]
*  publicly, and it's been pretty extraordinary how outspoken Israeli military leaders have [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1150.28s)]
*  been that all these issues can be addressed and that Israel can sign right now. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1154.56s)]
*  So you see an enormous amount of public tension inside of Israel and a great deal of tension [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1158.96s)]
*  between Netanyahu and American leadership, including President Biden. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1164.0800000000002s)]
*  What everyone pretty much knows is that what is holding Bibi Bakus is fear that if he does [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1168.52s)]
*  sign he's going to lose his far-right coalition partners and his government, and then his [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1172.6s)]
*  immunity from prosecution. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1177.8s)]
*  The timing on that, though, is potentially more propitious because the Knesset is about [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1180.04s)]
*  to go into a three-month recess and much less likely to topple a government under those [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1185.36s)]
*  conditions. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1189.6s)]
*  So possibly there were certainly no breakthroughs announced in Bibi's speech on the Hill. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1191.08s)]
*  He was as hardline as ever, and maybe when he talks to Biden he's willing to give him [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1197.32s)]
*  the big breakthrough. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1203.3999999999999s)]
*  Maybe when he talks to Harris he's willing to give him the big breakthrough. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1204.6799999999998s)]
*  We certainly know when this trip was originally cooked up it had nothing to do with moving [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1207.76s)]
*  a deal forward. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1210.9199999999998s)]
*  The Republican leadership on the Hill invited him and made no secret that they were doing [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  it to divide the Democrats, and dozens of Democratic lawmakers didn't show up. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1215.9199999999998s)]
*  The White House wasn't enthusiastic about Bibi coming at all, but they certainly want [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1220.6s)]
*  to use it now to push it forward. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1226.14s)]
*  So watch that space. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1227.7800000000002s)]
*  And we should note that in Netanyahu's address where he was certainly well aware of who he [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1228.7800000000002s)]
*  was speaking to and the venue he was in, he mentioned very graciously President Biden's [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1234.66s)]
*  support from Israel through the decades, also made clear his appreciation for President [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1240.02s)]
*  Trump's support during his term in office, without mentioning some of the areas of friction. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1244.74s)]
*  Other than that, he really strongly went after the protesters in the U.S. and called them [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1249.88s)]
*  essentially, if I'm getting the quote right, Iran's useful idiots, basically saying they're [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1255.1s)]
*  doing the bidding of Iran by protesting Israeli actions in Gaza, which many would take as [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1259.26s)]
*  a simplification of what those protests were about. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1264.98s)]
*  But clearly he was sort of laying out that position, and that position has some sympathy [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1268.3s)]
*  with some of the members in the U.S. Congress, though, as you say, there was a number of [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1273.86s)]
*  no shows and some protests as well. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1278.02s)]
*  So it's an intriguing visit at this time, you know, in the midst of a U.S. political [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1281.2s)]
*  campaign, he's trying to navigate. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1286.04s)]
*  Apparently there was also a note from the Palestinian Authority leader, Mahmoud Abbas, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1288.44s)]
*  to former President Trump, basically a gesture of communication there as well, which Trump, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1292.16s)]
*  I think, responded somewhat positively to. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1297.4s)]
*  So very interesting state of affairs playing out on the Middle East front, Carla. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1300.0s)]
*  And as for Netanyahu's visit with Trump, what should we be looking for in this trip? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1304.28s)]
*  Are we going to see them kind of dealing in detail on any sort of deal? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1307.96s)]
*  Does he want to give the win to Biden? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1313.3200000000002s)]
*  Does he want to give the win to Trump? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1315.5600000000002s)]
*  The line is always, you know, my friend Steve Erlanger for the Times always says that nothing [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1318.5600000000002s)]
*  that has to do with U.S. and Israel is foreign policy. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1323.52s)]
*  It's all domestic politics on both sides. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  Bibi desperately wants to get back into Trump's good graces. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump has been furious with him ever since Bibi was one of the first foreign leaders [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1333.76s)]
*  to congratulate Biden after the 2020 election win. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1337.62s)]
*  And Trump has been highly critical of Netanyahu. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1342.34s)]
*  He told a Florida rally that Bibi had betrayed the U.S. by pulling out of a mission to kill [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1345.7399999999998s)]
*  an Iranian general. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1349.78s)]
*  He's urged Israel to finish up the war. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1351.86s)]
*  He's warned Israel that they're losing a lot of support here. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1354.52s)]
*  Bibi certainly made no secret of his political preferences, but you're right, Bob. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1358.1399999999999s)]
*  In that speech, he was praised both Biden and Trump. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1361.5s)]
*  He was much more balanced and he assured American officials before he came here that this was [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1364.8999999999999s)]
*  not going to be like the 2015 speech. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1371.26s)]
*  He wasn't going to be up Biden's nose in this one. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1372.9799999999998s)]
*  But this trip, which is the somewhat unusual thing in the midst of a campaign to go visit [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1376.04s)]
*  the guy who's running, although Biden's not running now. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1381.6999999999998s)]
*  I think if he was going to give a win to anyone, he'd give a win to Trump. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1386.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's hope he doesn't decide to hold out until after the election for that ceasefire. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1389.58s)]
*  And I think the thing to watch, of course, is what does Biden say after the meeting? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1394.8999999999999s)]
*  Is he welcoming to Bibi? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1399.78s)]
*  Is he going to push him very publicly afterwards? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1401.6599999999999s)]
*  What does Kamala Harris say after the meeting? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1403.9399999999998s)]
*  Does she stake out a position different from Biden's or harsher on Bibi if they don't [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1405.98s)]
*  feel they're getting there? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1411.1799999999998s)]
*  And what does Trump say? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1413.74s)]
*  Does he say, I'm the one who's actually going to get the deal? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1414.74s)]
*  So there's a lot of dynamics there to watch. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1417.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1420.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, the Middle East getting hashed out over lunch in Mar-a-Lago, perhaps. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1421.6000000000001s)]
*  We'll have to see. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1426.0s)]
*  Bob, before we get to our audience figure of the week, I'd like to talk about very [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1427.48s)]
*  briefly another incredibly important story. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1432.0800000000002s)]
*  In the past week, secret Russian courts have unfairly and outrageously sentenced two of [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1434.2800000000002s)]
*  our colleagues to long prison sentences on false charges. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1440.16s)]
*  On Friday, Russian-American journalist Alesu Karmashov, an editor with the Tatar Bashkir [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1445.24s)]
*  Language Service of the US-funded Radio Liberty Radio Free Europe Service in Prague, was convicted [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1450.48s)]
*  on the manufactured charge of spreading false information about the Russian military and [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1455.14s)]
*  sentenced to six and a half years in prison. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1459.74s)]
*  Her husband says the charges relate to a book she edited that profiles Russians opposed [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1462.44s)]
*  to the war in Ukraine. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1466.52s)]
*  And on the same day, the Wall Street Journal's Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1468.2s)]
*  in a Russian penal colony on false charges of espionage. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1473.1999999999998s)]
*  His last article in the journal before his arrest, which ran in March 2023, carried the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1477.0s)]
*  headline Russia's economy is starting to come undone. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1481.28s)]
*  Alesu and Evan must be freed now. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1485.6799999999998s)]
*  And we cannot forget that the Russian government is holding at least 20 more Russian journalists. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1488.0s)]
*  Journalism is not a crime. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1493.54s)]
*  It's essential work for a healthy society. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1494.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1497.12s)]
*  And I think that last message is something that the US and other democracies are just [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1498.12s)]
*  going to have to keep hammering home repeatedly because where does this end? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1502.0s)]
*  And where does not just in Russia, but anywhere really. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1507.2s)]
*  And it's really one of the foundations of the functioning of the world. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1510.68s)]
*  And there's been a great deal of sneering at what's known as the rules-based international [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1514.22s)]
*  order. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1517.96s)]
*  But this is part of it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1518.96s)]
*  And while we will celebrate the return of Alesu and Evan and Paul Wellen, who's also [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1520.56s)]
*  another American, we cannot forget the horrific conditions for other Russian journalists and [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1526.86s)]
*  what has happened to NGOs and civil society in Russia. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1533.34s)]
*  This is a terrible place for free speech. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1538.1s)]
*  Well, Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1540.78s)]
*  And this is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore orgs [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1546.4s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1550.78s)]
*  And this week, Bob, our audience selected. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1552.5s)]
*  And on another happy topic, Houthi rebels escalate conflict with Israel. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1554.42s)]
*  And the Houthis are seen as a proxy force for Iran. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1560.9s)]
*  Is this Tehran picking a proxy fight with Israel? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1564.26s)]
*  I should say another proxy fight with Israel. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1568.14s)]
*  And why are the Israelis, which have a much more sophisticated military than the Houthis [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1570.68s)]
*  and pretty much everyone else in the region, why are they having such a hard time getting [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1574.52s)]
*  them to back off? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1578.14s)]
*  Well, first of all, note that the audience figure poll happened after we learned about [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1580.34s)]
*  the presence of sharks off of the Brazilian coast that had cocaine in their system. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1585.58s)]
*  Surely we would have included that in the running. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1589.54s)]
*  And that clearly would have been chosen. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1593.6999999999998s)]
*  That would seem to have been a front runner. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1596.7399999999998s)]
*  But in all seriousness, the Houthi front is a especially challenging one. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1598.54s)]
*  And this is part of what Iran has referred to as its axis of resistance. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1603.1s)]
*  They tend to all start with H's, Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthi rebels. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1606.78s)]
*  Houthi rebels were cultivated as they were rising up against the Yemeni government in [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1611.46s)]
*  part of the chronic civil war that Yemen has been dealing with, especially though since [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1616.5s)]
*  the so-called Arab Spring where there was a real public ferment to overthrow the government. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1621.06s)]
*  They control part of the Yemen at this point. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1625.86s)]
*  And they are a Shia in origin, although not automatically linked to Iran. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1628.84s)]
*  Iran, as I said, cultivated them and supplies them by many accounts with armaments. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1633.42s)]
*  What happened with the Houthi rebels most recently is they sent drones to Israel [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1638.1000000000001s)]
*  proper. And one of them got through. They sent, I believe it was four drones. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1643.0600000000002s)]
*  One of them got through to Tel Aviv and struck a building not far from the US consulate, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1646.7s)]
*  which raised speculation that maybe the consulate itself was a target. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1652.46s)]
*  But this was a drone that flew something like 1200 miles and got through what is one of the [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1655.7s)]
*  world's most sophisticated air defense systems and made a point. At least one person was killed [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1661.06s)]
*  in the attack. The Israelis responded with a very strong counterattack on a port in Hodeidah, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1665.74s)]
*  Yemen, where Houthis were said to have received support from Iran, including drone support. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1671.58s)]
*  The drone was said to be an Iranian-made drone. The Iranians are particularly skilled at making [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1678.54s)]
*  drones that fly long distances with lethal effect. And so the Israelis bombed port of [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1683.1399999999999s)]
*  Hodeidah, destroyed a number of fuel facilities among other things. And everybody is bracing now [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1690.34s)]
*  for another level of escalation. And the Houthis, by the way, have not been quiet in their Red Sea [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1696.4199999999998s)]
*  campaign, which they ramped up after the October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel as a further way [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1702.98s)]
*  of showing their solidarity with the Palestinian cause. And they've been extremely disruptive. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1708.86s)]
*  And not only has it been something that the Israelis have not been able to counter, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1713.58s)]
*  but the US has been trying to mount a pretty major series of strikes against the Houthi sources of [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1717.86s)]
*  these attacks on the Red Sea and has shot down any number of drones. But it's still not able to [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1723.86s)]
*  snuff this out. And again, this is yet another area where Iran figures and also the Houthis' [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1729.8999999999999s)]
*  own capabilities and a country like Yemen, which is now contested, it continues to be contested. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1736.06s)]
*  And it's further pointing to the fact that the Middle East is an area where escalation can occur [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1741.66s)]
*  quite quickly. And this is one they really need to try to get under control. And yet the Houthis [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1749.42s)]
*  have shown they can defy this quite easily. It's also quite intriguing because the Houthis [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1754.38s)]
*  are also a reminder and a warning of asymmetric warfare and how technology gets cheaper and how [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1760.38s)]
*  you can have cheap technology can wreak an enormous amount of havoc. And it's really [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1768.86s)]
*  expensive to knock something down cheap. And drones, they've been very good at cheap drones [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1773.74s)]
*  and very, very expensive missiles to knock them down. And that's only what the future holds and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1778.74s)]
*  of the nature of warfare. So a conversation for another day about how technology evolves. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1785.9799999999998s)]
*  And I'm sure we will be talking about them a lot. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1793.1s)]
*  Yes. Asymmetric is a term we first heard widely discussed after the 9-11 attacks, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1796.98s)]
*  but it only sort of dispersed further. Well, Claire, that's our look at a truly turbulent [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4c0T5EQVhY&t=1802.34s)]
