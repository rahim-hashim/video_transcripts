# Russia Hosts BRICS Summit, EU Leaders Talk Migration, UN Biodiversity Summit Kicks Off, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc)
*  In the coming week, Russia hosts this year's BRICS Summit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=0.0s)]
*  EU leaders meet to discuss possible changes to migration policy, and the UN Biodiversity [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=5.24s)]
*  Summit begins in Colombia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=10.16s)]
*  It's October 17, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=12.24s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=27.36s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=28.52s)]
*  Carly, we usually start off by saying things are still happening as we tape this podcast. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=29.52s)]
*  And just as we sat down this morning, reports came in that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=35.0s)]
*  was the architect behind the October 7 attacks on Israel, has been killed in Gaza. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=39.76s)]
*  He was killed by the Israeli military, according to reports that came out after identifying [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  DNA testing in Israel, according to an Israeli official, although Hamas officials would not [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=49.4s)]
*  immediately confirm his death. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=54.08s)]
*  A pretty extraordinary development. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  There have been some comparisons, obviously, already made about Nasrallah, and Nasrallah [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=57.48s)]
*  was seen as this generational figure, really hard to replace. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=62.16s)]
*  But Hezbollah is a different type of group, a different organized group, and is going [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=64.72s)]
*  to sort of muddle through in a way that Hamas might find more difficult when someone like [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=69.32s)]
*  Sinjar leaving the scene. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=74.24s)]
*  But the targeted killing approach is sort of useful to a point for some countries, but [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=76.16s)]
*  it's not clear how this changes the calculus or not. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=81.52s)]
*  Watch the space. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  So the tablets start in Russia, which is hosting this year's BRICS. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=86.04s)]
*  That's Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa Summit. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  And the location of this summit is a really grim reminder of how Putin has managed to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  break out of his isolation and how many countries are sitting on the sidelines in the Ukraine [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  war or actively supporting Moscow as it violates the most basic global norms. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  You don't change borders with force, and Putin is doing that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  This is going to be the first summit since the BRICS expansion with Egypt, Ethiopia, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=113.6s)]
*  Iran, and the United Arab Emirates now at the table. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  And last week, the Kremlin was also claiming the Saudis as a member, but they've since [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=121.28s)]
*  walked that back. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  What's on the agenda for this meeting, and are the Saudis playing hard to get? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  First I'll touch on what you mentioned, the sort of the stepping out of Russia as host [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  of this in Kazan. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  And that is an important symbolic effect. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  And I think we keep on saying with the BRICS that there's symbolism, there's symbolism, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=141.32s)]
*  but it actually does matter because they've endured for 15 plus years, which I think a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  number of people didn't think was possible as a formal grouping, even though there's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  not any sort of a organized institution in and around the BRICS. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a rotating hosting of this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  But they do discuss increasingly concrete proposals. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=159.6s)]
*  One big one to look for is the BRICS cross border payments initiative. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=162.98s)]
*  That would include a new system, a messaging system, and a network of national commercial [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=167.42s)]
*  banks linked to each other through what are known as BRICS central banks. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  And the big goal there is to remove the need to exchange local currencies through the US [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=175.61999999999998s)]
*  dollar. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=180.54s)]
*  These countries, Russia in particular, China close behind it, and now Iran as a new member [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=181.54s)]
*  very much would love to circumvent the US dollar and its prime role. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Russia and Iran among the most sanctioned countries in the world. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=190.98s)]
*  And the US dollar dominance has been an important part of that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=194.56s)]
*  And so that's going to be an important thing to watch. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=199.3s)]
*  There's still a lot of complications. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=203.4s)]
*  A lot of economists would say this is still going to be something that is going to be [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=204.84s)]
*  very difficult to roll out for these countries. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=208.48s)]
*  But they are showing a desire to do it, including the democracies that are in the BRICS, India, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=210.98s)]
*  Brazil, South Africa. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=215.62s)]
*  And now you have this expanding group, including Gulf countries, whether or not Saudi Arabia [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=217.7s)]
*  does come ahead and formally join. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=222.38000000000002s)]
*  It has indicated it would like to. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=224.34s)]
*  By the way, we should note Argentina was offered membership and declined. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=226.78s)]
*  So would it be BRICS or BRICS? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=230.02s)]
*  Very good. Yes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=232.5s)]
*  I knew you were waiting for that opportunity. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=233.9s)]
*  But yes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=235.46s)]
*  But again, back to what I was going to say at the start, which is an opportunity for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  Russia to come out with these world leaders. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=239.46s)]
*  There'll be many leaders attending this at a time when he continues to be a pariah, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=242.02s)]
*  certainly in many of the Western chambers that he was accustomed to appearing in. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=247.10000000000002s)]
*  And has a warrant from the ICC. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=251.86s)]
*  He has a warrant from the ICC. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=253.38000000000002s)]
*  You know, Russia has been suspended from the UN Human Rights Council. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=254.9s)]
*  It is not currently active in the OECD, the OSCE. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=259.02000000000004s)]
*  It's not in the group of eight anymore, which is known as the group of seven. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=263.5s)]
*  That ended after the initial invasion of Ukraine and on and on. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  There are so many other groups that Russia had been part of and a participant in and just [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=270.74s)]
*  doesn't have a voice in anymore. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=275.14s)]
*  And this movement into groups like the BRICS is setting in motion what we talked about [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=277.26s)]
*  before, which is this sense not only of Russia and China, but other countries that they're [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=281.14s)]
*  not happy with the norms and the Western led and the US led system of institutions that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=285.62s)]
*  have dominated in terms of the IMF and the World Bank. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=292.14s)]
*  The US itself is now undermining the WTO, which had been a champion of. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=295.97999999999996s)]
*  And so whether it's a global South movement or it's just some sort of a ongoing challenge [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=301.38s)]
*  to the system that had the post-war system set up, the BRICS is manifesting this unhappiness. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=307.58s)]
*  And so they will go ahead and they will try to create this sort of new economic cohesion. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=313.26s)]
*  They will come out with statements or perhaps non-statements on things like the Russian [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=319.41999999999996s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=323.38s)]
*  They will try to make common cause in things like cultural exchanges. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=325.0s)]
*  What was the last time you saw a cultural exchange with Russia, for example, or humanitarian [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=329.02s)]
*  ties, things like that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  There are all sorts of soft power ways in which the BRICS can continue to build on that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=335.5s)]
*  And again, Russia being able to host this next week in Kazan is able to say, we are [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=339.5s)]
*  in the right and we are embraced by our peers and we are going to move ahead and create [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=344.78s)]
*  a new system. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=349.62s)]
*  And so that I think continues to be the big takeaway while they do talk about some tangible [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=350.82s)]
*  changes in terms of some sort of way of circumventing the dollar's dominance. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=356.14s)]
*  As you said, there are democracies going to this and they are democracies that have been [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=360.26s)]
*  sitting on the fence in the Ukraine war, notably Brazil, India, South Africa. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=366.14s)]
*  India in particular, it's playing all sides in a really disturbing way. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, they're members of the quad. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  And do you get the sense that the United States sits down with them and says, you know, guys, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=380.94s)]
*  we're not going to tell you to get out of the BRICS. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=388.42s)]
*  They have a huge resilience, a huge investment in the BRICS. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=390.7s)]
*  But don't go to Russia. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=394.38s)]
*  This is really, really a bridge too far here. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=397.1s)]
*  Do you get any sense that they made any effort like that? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  This is such an extraordinary family photo op for Putin. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=402.54s)]
*  This is just really, I'm back. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=406.14s)]
*  Nobody's taken my sins seriously anymore. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=409.3s)]
*  Do you get any sense that they tried to stop it? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=412.1s)]
*  India poses a special challenge and it really does seem to have set in this sense of real [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=415.26s)]
*  politique with India that it's important to be a partner when it can be with the US, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=419.41999999999996s)]
*  that the US has no illusions that it's going to be any sort of an ally. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=423.82s)]
*  And just if you look at India's purchases of discounted Russian oil, for example, enormous [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=429.7s)]
*  amounts of money that have been a main way of circumventing the sanctions against Russia, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=436.02s)]
*  that's huge. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=441.94s)]
*  Modi has not been shy though of appearing at Putin when he can and of continuing contacts [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=443.34s)]
*  with Russia and saying warm things about the relationship, which goes back. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=448.78s)]
*  The New Delhi-Moscow goes back into the Cold War era and India leading the non-aligned [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=452.38s)]
*  movement vigorously. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=457.26s)]
*  But it does have, as you say, it's part of the quad. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=459.46s)]
*  It's got these important ties with the US that it is also proud of and growing economic [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=461.44s)]
*  ties and there's a huge Indian diaspora in the United States, a huge Indian immigrant [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=466.7s)]
*  community in the United States. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=472.34s)]
*  And that creates a sense that certainly we can make common cause on areas so important. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=474.21999999999997s)]
*  And yet, here we are, we're in this world where there are these competing poles of influence [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=479.14s)]
*  and Modi is sort of deftly navigating this world right now. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=484.29999999999995s)]
*  I do think, and I know we need to move on, but I do think that the United States and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  our allies have to have a serious conversation with ourselves about why so many countries [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=492.53999999999996s)]
*  feel that they can sit on the fence in this. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=497.0s)]
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a fundamental violation of international law, violation [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=502.3s)]
*  of the UN Charter, violation of the self-interest of so many countries that could be invaded [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=506.26000000000005s)]
*  themselves. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=510.98s)]
*  And there is this what about-ism there and we really do need to think about what is happening [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=511.98s)]
*  in the world that people can be so blase about this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=517.22s)]
*  And let's not forget the other multilateral events coming up, an increasingly intriguing [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=520.9s)]
*  one is the G20 summit in Brazil, first while member of the BRICS. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=525.1s)]
*  And who is attending that from Russia? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=529.78s)]
*  That will be interesting to watch. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=531.98s)]
*  Carla, let's pivot to Brussels where European leaders are meeting to talk about migration. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=533.6600000000001s)]
*  This comes at calls for speedier deportations and changed asylum processes grow increasingly [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=539.3000000000001s)]
*  louder among leaders, certainly as politics shifts to the right, to the populist right [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=545.5400000000001s)]
*  in many countries in the EU. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=550.62s)]
*  So Carla, what is the status of the current migration pact and how could this meeting [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=552.74s)]
*  shake things up? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=558.1s)]
*  So the Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hoped this meeting was a chance to restore [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=559.82s)]
*  some discipline to what is becoming an increasingly chaotic race to the bottom among EU member [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=565.74s)]
*  states on migration law. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  You're seeing all across Europe this rise of anti-immigrant sentiment looks very familiar [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=573.62s)]
*  to us here in the United States and a rise of the power of far-right parties that are [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=579.0200000000001s)]
*  demagoguing this. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=583.82s)]
*  Germany, which has national elections next September, has introduced border controls [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=585.1800000000001s)]
*  with all its neighbors. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=589.0s)]
*  We've talked about this and it's suspended the passport-free Schengen zone. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=590.0s)]
*  France, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Italy and Slovenia have also introduced border checks. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=594.44s)]
*  But the most recent and surprising move was this week's announcement from Poland of a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=601.1600000000001s)]
*  new migration policy that would temporarily suspend the right to claim asylum for people [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=606.32s)]
*  crossing the border from Belarus. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=611.52s)]
*  And the really surprising thing about this is who is championing it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=613.76s)]
*  This is not the far-right party in Poland. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=618.04s)]
*  This is its centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who everybody cheered when he came back. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=620.48s)]
*  He's a former European Council President. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=624.76s)]
*  He's an enormously big power player in Brussels. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=627.12s)]
*  And he's no nativist. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=630.24s)]
*  He came back power last year after the Poles voted out the far-right anti-immigrant law [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  and justice party. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=636.04s)]
*  Poland has taken in thousands of Belarusians since the uprising against Lukashenko's rigged [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  2020 election. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=642.56s)]
*  But as we've recently heard from Finland, he and others say that Lukashenko and Putin [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=644.48s)]
*  have been pushing other migrants across the border as a form of hybrid warfare. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=649.04s)]
*  That is probably true, but Tusk is really going far out on this thing right now. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=654.2s)]
*  He's sounding more and more MAGA by the minute. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=659.04s)]
*  He really is. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=661.36s)]
*  Commission officials earlier this week were saying that Tusk's plan violated EU laws. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=663.44s)]
*  But by today, at this meeting that started, it's a two-day meeting, people are celebrating [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=667.22s)]
*  it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=672.24s)]
*  People are saying, this is the way we want to go. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=673.24s)]
*  We've got to worry about hybrid warfare. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=674.24s)]
*  This is all a security issue. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=675.8s)]
*  They're talking about crime from migrants. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=677.2s)]
*  It sounds so much like what's going on here in the US election. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=679.36s)]
*  But what's really important to know as well is that this is a political crisis more than [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=683.48s)]
*  a migration crisis. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=687.26s)]
*  The numbers are really falling in Europe. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  According to the EU border agency, which is Frontex, the number of irregular migrants [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=691.44s)]
*  arriving in Europe last year were less than a third of the number who came at the peak [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=695.4s)]
*  of the 2015 migration crisis. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=699.24s)]
*  In the first nine months of this year, the number had declined by 42% compared to the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=702.36s)]
*  same period last year to about 160,000 people. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=707.0s)]
*  We look at what we talk about here. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=711.36s)]
*  But centrist leaders are panicking about the rising power of the far-right parties. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=713.6400000000001s)]
*  Facts don't matter in the face of political demagoguery. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=719.1600000000001s)]
*  So Vondelan had hoped that she could get the countries back in line by committing to speeding [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=722.84s)]
*  up the implementation of a pact on migration that she had engineered that took her several [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=727.9000000000001s)]
*  years to get through, that they finally passed in May just in time for the parliamentary [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=732.34s)]
*  elections that they thought would hold off the far-right and didn't hold off the far-right. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=737.34s)]
*  But it wasn't going to be implemented until 2026. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=741.4200000000001s)]
*  So I think she was going to go there and say, let's speed it up. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  And what it would have done was empowered these so-called frontline states like Greece [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=748.4200000000001s)]
*  and Italy to process migrants a lot faster and those that don't meet asylum terms to [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=751.9s)]
*  get them out and to give the rest of the EU that are supposed to share the burden and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=758.66s)]
*  let in migrants that do meet asylum terms by saying, well, at least we'll accept them [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=763.9s)]
*  or maybe we'll pick up the burden another way. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=769.62s)]
*  We'll put money in or we'll send personnel or do something like that. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=771.54s)]
*  They don't want that. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=774.9s)]
*  They want to do something a lot more aggressive than that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=775.9s)]
*  And we can talk about what they want to do, but it looks a lot like it's going to violate [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=778.22s)]
*  fundamental EU law. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=782.26s)]
*  They want to deport migrants a lot faster. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=784.4200000000001s)]
*  People are talking about a lot of things that were taboo even a few weeks ago. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=787.7s)]
*  Other schemes being discussed. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=790.94s)]
*  They want to send rejected migrants to allegedly safer third country. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=792.38s)]
*  It sounds a lot like Rishi Sunak's, let's send them to Rwanda idea. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=795.6600000000001s)]
*  Netherlands and Hungary are already talking about sending people to Uganda. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=800.38s)]
*  This week opened two processing centers in Albania and delivered 16 men that they intercepted [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=804.7399999999999s)]
*  in international waters. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=810.5s)]
*  Georgia Maloney used to be a pariah, coming from the brothers of Italy, nativist group. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=812.4599999999999s)]
*  Now she's everybody's favorite. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=818.06s)]
*  Tell me how to do it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=819.88s)]
*  Keira Stormer went and talked to her in Italy. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=820.88s)]
*  Tell me how you're reducing the number of migrants. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=822.9799999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot of ideas on the table that they're looking at very seriously that, honestly [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=825.02s)]
*  and truly a few weeks ago, I couldn't even imagine them considering. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=829.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's certainly driven by politics. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=833.5799999999999s)]
*  We should note that, as you say, the numbers themselves have dropped off on the trend lines. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=837.5799999999999s)]
*  There are still existing numbers of migrants in many of these countries whose presence [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=843.62s)]
*  alone in the thousands, depending on what country, is continuing to become a source [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=848.68s)]
*  of concern as well as misinformation from the nativist groups. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=854.06s)]
*  Many times these are people from, pick the world's toughest spots right now, Afghanistan, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=859.16s)]
*  Syria, places in the Middle East, North Africa, the people being driven out of Sudan right [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=864.76s)]
*  now or people who are increasingly climate refugees. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=869.56s)]
*  All of these are in the mix and they're either trying to make the very difficult set of crossings [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=873.64s)]
*  on the Mediterranean or they find themselves enticed up to places like Belarus, which has [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=878.6s)]
*  then weaponized them into a country like Poland. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=883.68s)]
*  You have Tusk doing what a lot of politicians, centrist politicians and others are doing, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=886.76s)]
*  which is trying to seize a little of the initiative to steal a little of the thunder of right-wing [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=891.2s)]
*  movements to both stay in power and one imagines to potentially in the long game take control [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=896.52s)]
*  of policy again from a position that's more traditional of the rules-based order in the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=902.92s)]
*  way in which asylum cases are processed and so forth. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=908.6s)]
*  As you noted, I think you're going to see more and more of these instances in which [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=912.58s)]
*  there are countries brokering deals with source countries or countries that are near the front [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=916.32s)]
*  lines. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=919.96s)]
*  Albania decided to take up this agreement with Italy as a gesture to be a good neighbor, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=920.96s)]
*  to score some points for its future accession perhaps into European bodies, all of those [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=926.0400000000001s)]
*  things. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=930.7600000000001s)]
*  North African countries like Tunisia are part of this. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=931.7600000000001s)]
*  Getting millions of dollars from the EU and Von der Leyen negotiated that deal to stop [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=934.88s)]
*  migrants there and allegedly they're going to spend money to make better life there. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=941.16s)]
*  But when they kind of deal like that with Libya before that, we know what happened. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=946.3199999999999s)]
*  Boats were getting sunk, people were getting shot. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=950.8399999999999s)]
*  Human rights groups and migration groups say that this is outsourcing border control and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=953.3s)]
*  nobody's paying attention to what's actually happening. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=959.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=961.48s)]
*  Again, it's a measure of the degree of real concern that has been driven by public attitudes [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=962.48s)]
*  in these countries and these politicians are scrambling now. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=968.1999999999999s)]
*  So it's a real test, as you say, for the European Union to figure out what is the way they can [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=970.96s)]
*  continue to observe proper humane treatment established under longstanding laws, post-war [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=975.32s)]
*  laws, and at the same time, sort of dial down the pressure that these countries are facing. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=981.84s)]
*  Austria and Germany most recently had political results that saw real gains by far-right parties. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=987.5600000000001s)]
*  So it is a big test for the EU at a time when it's being tested seemingly on many other [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=994.08s)]
*  fronts too. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=999.92s)]
*  I just keep going back to those numbers, why there is this rise of far-right sentiment [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1000.92s)]
*  when the migration numbers are really radically going down. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1006.92s)]
*  And you just kept coming back to how much of this is Russian disinformation? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1011.28s)]
*  How much of this is just sheer demagoguery? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1015.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, there is no crisis except for a political crisis. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1017.68s)]
*  Let's move our conversation to Colombia, which is hosting the UN Biodiversity Summit. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1023.16s)]
*  The theme this year is Peace with Nature. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1027.68s)]
*  We've seen so many climate disasters lately hit regions around the world, and most recently [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1030.8s)]
*  these two hurricanes in the United States. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1036.3600000000001s)]
*  Bob, what are the goals of this year's meeting? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1038.3200000000002s)]
*  And can we, if you forgive me, and I'm going to blame our producer, Molly, can we give [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1041.16s)]
*  biodiversity a chance? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1045.76s)]
*  Well, the theme of the meeting is Peace with Nature, Carla, which sounds great. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1047.64s)]
*  And the meeting is taking place in the city of Kali, and so you had some wags calling [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1053.12s)]
*  it Califana Dreaming. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1058.28s)]
*  So the host country is one of the most biodiverse countries in one of the most biodiverse regions [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  of the world. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1066.2399999999998s)]
*  So it's very significant that this meeting is taking place, even though it's in very [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1067.28s)]
*  much of a review meeting, because the last meeting, and this is called, we've heard [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1070.6s)]
*  the term COP used for the climate meetings, and there's going to be one next month in [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  Azerbaijan. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1078.36s)]
*  This is also a series of meetings now called COP, the BioCOP meeting. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1079.84s)]
*  So the last BioCOP was two years ago. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1083.22s)]
*  COP being Conference of Parties. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1084.56s)]
*  Conference of Parties, right. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1086.36s)]
*  The last one of these was in Montreal, and it produced the Global Biodiversity Framework. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1087.72s)]
*  Some people have said it's the parish agreement of the biodiversity movement. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1093.52s)]
*  A number of targets were set, a number of ambitious targets that seem to be pretty remote. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1096.6s)]
*  But let me start out with a quick definition of biodiversity for those wondering where [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1101.1799999999998s)]
*  that's coming from. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1105.4399999999998s)]
*  I'll just use the quotation described by the organizers. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1106.84s)]
*  Biodiversity refers to a variety of life on earth, extending from the simplest and smallest [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1110.68s)]
*  genes to the most complex ecosystems. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1114.84s)]
*  It encompasses evolutionary, ecological, and cultural processes that sustain life, and [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1117.68s)]
*  that would include human life as well, which is, again, why this is important at the end [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1122.04s)]
*  of the day. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1126.2s)]
*  And this meeting that's taking place in Cali is going to be attended by something like [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1127.76s)]
*  10,000 to 12,000 people, including a number of people from business interests. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1132.08s)]
*  At the end of the day, nature, of course, is a very important asset for businesses. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1137.08s)]
*  They want to be at the table if certain controls are going to be set in place. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1141.56s)]
*  But also have a number of companies and business sectors have set into their goals, actually, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1145.46s)]
*  sustaining a biodiverse pathway to life. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1151.12s)]
*  So at the very least, there's some lip service being paid to the importance of biodiversity. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1153.76s)]
*  Work targets that have been set include conserving 30% of land, water, and sea. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1159.48s)]
*  And some countries have actually stepped up to this, but it needs a lot more. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1164.54s)]
*  And The Guardian, for instance, recently reported that countries that were supposed to just [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1168.48s)]
*  at the very least submit plans by this COP, of the countries that were supposed to submit [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1172.92s)]
*  plans, 80% have not. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1177.32s)]
*  And these are national biodiversity strategies and action plans. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1179.08s)]
*  Coming just ahead of this summit was a report, a very sobering report released by the World [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1183.0s)]
*  Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report 2024 that says there has been a 73% decline in [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1188.12s)]
*  the average size of monitored wildlife populations since 1970. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1196.0s)]
*  And this is based on an index provided by the Zoological Society of London, which tracks [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1200.8799999999999s)]
*  35,000 plus vertebrate populations since 1970, or from 1970 to 2020. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1206.56s)]
*  The biggest decline in these species, 85% are in freshwater populations, followed by [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1213.08s)]
*  land-based and then marine. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1218.04s)]
*  So we've all heard the stories. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1220.3799999999999s)]
*  We've heard about the recent alarm over colony collapse syndrome involving bees and honey [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1222.1599999999999s)]
*  bees and their ability to pollinate many of the trees that create the fruits and nuts [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1226.8799999999999s)]
*  and things that we like to eat. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1231.78s)]
*  But it goes far beyond that. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  The most recent economist has also a sobering piece about a real surge in trafficking of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1234.8s)]
*  animals out of Latin America because it is incredibly valuable to the trafficking networks [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1239.36s)]
*  to organize crime networks. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1244.3999999999999s)]
*  And this has surged. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1246.6s)]
*  So things like jaguar teeth and precious birds being stuffed inside different types of storage [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1247.8s)]
*  bins and things like that are starting to come up as customs people come across these. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1254.28s)]
*  And even though there are laws on the books preventing such things, there's very little [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1259.28s)]
*  enforcement either capacity or will in some cases. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1262.96s)]
*  And the ability to bribe customs officials in these places is also makes it a pretty [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1266.32s)]
*  easy game. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1270.3999999999999s)]
*  So this meeting, this COP is a review meeting, but it's also it's about the very future [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1271.6399999999999s)]
*  of the living beings and the cycles of living beings on this planet. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1276.8799999999999s)]
*  And so it's really important that some markers be laid out that they can hit. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1280.6399999999999s)]
*  So the Paris Accord laid out markers, at least the success of it such as it was, and people [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1285.12s)]
*  were supposed to start fessing up about how much progress or not that they've made toward [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1293.56s)]
*  their nationally determined contributions to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1297.6399999999999s)]
*  So they not even yet set markers for the biodiversity. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1302.52s)]
*  Other than this 30% rule I mentioned, these are like the Paris Agreement. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1306.0s)]
*  These are all voluntary, by the way, there's no binding agreements. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1310.0s)]
*  But there is this sense of obligation if you do sign up to which is which is why it has [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1313.1599999999999s)]
*  been difficult for some countries even to get to that point. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1318.08s)]
*  There's a sense of obligation that you say you were going to commit to leaving a certain [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1320.0400000000002s)]
*  portion of your land free of development or of ruinous development, then you should step [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1324.2800000000002s)]
*  up to it. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1329.16s)]
*  And countries, including European countries, have had a hard time doing it. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1330.16s)]
*  It was reported the UK is not going to be able to have its plan in place, partly because [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1333.0s)]
*  of the new government there and a lot of things they're trying to accomplish. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1336.3600000000001s)]
*  So it's about sort of stepping up and saying, hey, who's actually provided commitments [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1339.8000000000002s)]
*  here? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1345.0s)]
*  Who is willing to take part in data sharing? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1346.0s)]
*  One of the things that is supposed to be most important about this COP is the ability [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1347.94s)]
*  to really track data and for countries to be working from the same sort of tracking [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1351.9s)]
*  information to be able to keep pace of animal populations, plant populations and so forth. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1356.5s)]
*  There's also a really important discussion going on. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1362.3s)]
*  It's not expected to reach solid agreement, but about the genetic material and how you [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1365.02s)]
*  can follow, how you can track genetic material, how countries can share information so that [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1369.5800000000002s)]
*  they can properly keep track of genetic material that can be used to create food and vaccines [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1375.9s)]
*  and other products. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1379.64s)]
*  Again, biodiversity is not only great for healthy cycles and healthy ecosystems, but [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1380.64s)]
*  biodiversity usually translates into medicinal uses. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1386.96s)]
*  It translates into all sorts of benefits for society and for human society. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1390.8400000000001s)]
*  And Carla, we have talked ourselves into the audience figure of the week portion of the [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1395.3400000000001s)]
*  podcast, which is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1398.92s)]
*  org's Instagram story. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1405.26s)]
*  This week, Carla, our audience selected Canada expels Indian diplomats. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1407.2s)]
*  So what has led to this expulsion? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1412.38s)]
*  This is a bizarre and brazen story. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1414.8200000000002s)]
*  We know that Russians go around murdering their opponents overseas and certainly we [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1418.28s)]
*  know the famous case of Jamal Khashoggi from the Saudis. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1422.72s)]
*  We really don't expect this from a sort of democracy like India. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1427.42s)]
*  Canada announced the expulsion this week of six Indian diplomats, including the high commissioner [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1432.92s)]
*  to Canada. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1438.3200000000002s)]
*  And these diplomats were accused of being part of a broad criminal network to, they [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1440.44s)]
*  say, harass Canadian Sikhs. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1445.52s)]
*  Canada has the largest Sikh population outside of India. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1447.3200000000002s)]
*  And they say they're tied to this murder in June of Sikh separatist leader, Hardeep Singh [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1451.28s)]
*  Najjar. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1457.48s)]
*  And in response to this, India immediately kicked out six Canadian diplomats. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1458.72s)]
*  Najjar was a Canadian citizen living in British Columbia who came to Canada some 30 years [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1462.96s)]
*  ago. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1467.48s)]
*  And in 2020, the Indian government declared him a terrorist for his political work in [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1468.48s)]
*  Canada calling for the creation of an independent state in northern India called Khalistan. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1472.6000000000001s)]
*  The Indian government accused him of leading a terrorist group. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1478.24s)]
*  But people in Punjab, people went out and reported this said they never even heard of him. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1481.44s)]
*  So the Sikhs are only a tiny fraction of India's population, but they are a large population [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1486.2s)]
*  in Canada comparatively. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1491.48s)]
*  And the Indian government's really obsessed with this. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1493.32s)]
*  So the case really sees the attention of the Trudeau government. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1495.76s)]
*  And in September of last year, three months after Najjar's murder, the Canadian prime [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1499.06s)]
*  minister, this is really unusual. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1503.52s)]
*  I mean, Trudeau got up and said he had credible information that the Indian government had [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1504.52s)]
*  a hand in this killing. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1509.96s)]
*  This high profile announcement was not taken well as you can imagine in India. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1511.64s)]
*  And in May, the Canadians arrested and charged three men for the murder. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1516.52s)]
*  And at a press conference this week, the Mounties said that the six diplomats were involved. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1520.4s)]
*  So this has become a really, really high profile face off between the Indian and Canadian governments. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1526.1200000000001s)]
*  The Indian government fiercely rejecting all the allegation and it says that Trudeau is [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1532.4s)]
*  pandering to the Canada Sikhs who tend to support his Liberal Party. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1537.24s)]
*  Trudeau seems absolutely furious about this, about this meddling to charge the Indians [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1541.36s)]
*  for meddling in Indian politics as well. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1544.84s)]
*  And it is really an extraordinary thing to see a prime minister so directly involved [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1547.52s)]
*  in a criminal case like this and talking about this. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1551.6399999999999s)]
*  And finally, there are some US links to this story. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1555.24s)]
*  In November last year, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment against an Indian government [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1558.0s)]
*  employee for an alleged foiled murder for hire plot. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1562.76s)]
*  The target was the general counsel for a group called Sikhs for Justice in New York. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1567.76s)]
*  We know the US really shares intelligence really closely with the Canadians and certainly [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1573.84s)]
*  knows a lot about the allegations that Trudeau surfaced. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1578.24s)]
*  But at the same time as Trudeau was speaking out really forcefully against the Modi government, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1582.36s)]
*  the Biden has been quite cozy with India's leader and geopolitics has a way of doing that. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1586.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we were just talking about the Indian role in the world and the US relationship [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1593.36s)]
*  with the Modi government. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1599.04s)]
*  And as you say, while the US and India might have a partnership and certain cordial aspect [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  to it, US and Canada are, it's hard to find anything, any relationship tighter than that [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1606.28s)]
*  one. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1611.04s)]
*  And they share lots of information and have lots of common threads. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1612.04s)]
*  It's going to pose a bit of a challenge for the US to continue to navigate this, especially [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1615.92s)]
*  as the Modi government seems to be intent on pursuing what it sees as enemies abroad. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1619.6s)]
*  Just one final point, as this was going on, of course, MBS, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1625.76s)]
*  before he went to his BRICS meeting, he was making nice and they were making nice with [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1633.7199999999998s)]
*  the EU as well. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1638.8s)]
*  So there was a tendency that even when governments go out and murder people, if they're powerful [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1640.48s)]
*  enough, people have a way of forgetting. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHcZAeJFKc&t=1645.48s)]
