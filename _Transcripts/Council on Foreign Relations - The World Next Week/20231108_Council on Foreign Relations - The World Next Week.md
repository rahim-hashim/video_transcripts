# Blinken Visits South Pacific, Colombia-ELN Cease-Fire, Thailand’s Political Face-off, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU)
*  In the coming week, Secretary Blinken wraps up a strategic Pacific tour in Australia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=0.0s)]
*  the Colombian government and rebels commence a ceasefire and Thailand navigates a potential [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=7.08s)]
*  battle royale. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=12.08s)]
*  It's July 27, 2023 and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=13.08s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=26.28s)]
*  And I'm Carly Anne Robbins. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=27.28s)]
*  So Bob, let's start in the Pacific. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=29.08s)]
*  This Saturday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken wraps up his trip to Tonga, New Zealand [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=31.52s)]
*  and Australia. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=36.4s)]
*  So besides cheering on the US women's soccer team, what's Blinken's agenda? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=38.0s)]
*  Security is obviously a big one with Australia, which is now part of AUKUS and the Quad. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=42.36s)]
*  But why New Zealand other than the soccer teams and why Tonga, which has a population [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=47.04s)]
*  of 100,000 people? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=51.459999999999994s)]
*  Well, if I could say one word or one country, Carla, it would be China. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=52.459999999999994s)]
*  In fact, one could say China, like nature, abhors a vacuum and has perceived a vacuum [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=57.36s)]
*  in the Pacific Rim and has moved in with a great deal of verve in terms of signing up [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=62.04s)]
*  countries for infrastructure deals, sometimes security arrangements, police training, things [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=67.64s)]
*  like that, all of which has certainly gotten the attention of the US as well as its allies, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Australia and New Zealand. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=76.2s)]
*  And so you've had a set of plans and summits and visits that have been lined up by the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=78.12s)]
*  Biden administration that last year there was a summit that the US held with Pacific [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=84.04s)]
*  Island nations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=88.12s)]
*  They're due to hold another one, I believe in September. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=89.12s)]
*  And they have been making a case against what they call China's economic coercion. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  We heard this again from Anthony Blinken when he visited Tonga. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  This I believe was the first visit ever by a US cabinet minister to that archipelago [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=99.76s)]
*  nation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=104.48s)]
*  And so Tonga getting a lot of attention. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  It has already gotten attention from China. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=107.0s)]
*  It has itself said it's not engaging in any sort of competition, but it's certainly [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=109.28s)]
*  glad for the attention. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=113.9s)]
*  And you also have this week playing out the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, visiting [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=115.9s)]
*  Papua New Guinea. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=120.48s)]
*  And he will join Anthony Blinken in Australia for the wrap up to these travels in a meeting [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=122.06s)]
*  that the US and Australians hold a bilateral meeting that is called the Australia US Ministerial [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=126.98s)]
*  Consultations or AUSMIN, not AUKUS. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=132.06s)]
*  The State Department was clear in saying this is not AUKUS. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=135.58s)]
*  There's no UK there, but there are certainly overtures of AUKUS, which is the US strategic [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=137.9s)]
*  and security relationship with Australia on the discussion board. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=142.86s)]
*  But I think he'll also hear, Blinken in particular, will also hear from his counterparts in New [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=146.82000000000002s)]
*  Zealand and Australia, among other things concerned about China's ramping up activities [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=150.74s)]
*  in the region, which is again, economic. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=155.94000000000003s)]
*  Sometimes it forays into helping these countries in police and security matters and involves [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=158.82000000000002s)]
*  potential overtures on basing and things like that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=164.86s)]
*  These two countries watch these issues extremely closely. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=167.72000000000003s)]
*  They're very concerned about China stepping out further. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=170.42s)]
*  It's already been very assertive in what it calls its nine dash line in the South China [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=173.26s)]
*  Sea. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=177.17999999999998s)]
*  So as I said at the beginning, a lot of China on the agenda, in addition to trying to show [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=178.17999999999998s)]
*  that in person, the US is back. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=183.5s)]
*  The visit to Tonga, for example, was there to herald the opening of a US embassy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=185.33999999999997s)]
*  And there's supposed to be a permanent ambassadorial presence coming to Tonga as well, as well as [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  more ambassadors and diplomats in the region steadily. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  So again, it's the US trying to indicate presence and momentum in its presence in the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=199.22s)]
*  region and then concluding with its very big and growing security partner, Australia. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=205.22s)]
*  So deliverables, that's always what diplomats think about when they go on these visits. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=210.66s)]
*  Obviously, it's a big deal to have the US Secretary of State visit small places. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=215.62s)]
*  But a lot of these small countries are confronted with rising seas. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=221.1s)]
*  I think Kiribati is one of the places that we're going to be looking at developing a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=225.78s)]
*  relationship with, maybe even putting a diplomatic mission there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=229.94s)]
*  That place is going to be inundated by the waters at some point very soon. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=234.22s)]
*  What are these countries asking for? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  Are they asking for money? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=240.02s)]
*  Are they asking for climate remediation? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=241.02s)]
*  Are they asking for security against China? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=243.02s)]
*  What's their focus? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  I think climate is very much on the agenda and sometimes gets overshadowed in all the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=246.98000000000002s)]
*  talk about China. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=250.54000000000002s)]
*  They are very concerned. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=251.58s)]
*  It's not an overstatement to say this is an existential issue for them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=253.14s)]
*  It is about moving populations out of areas that had been seen as safe that are no longer, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=256.46s)]
*  that are lower lying. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=261.26s)]
*  They are on the front lines of these rising sea levels and will be needing help in moving [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  people in creating communities that can show resilience in the face of climate change. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=268.18s)]
*  It's not only rising seas, it's also incredibly intense storms that have the potential to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  run roughshod over these communities. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=278.5s)]
*  So I think it's adding that resilience. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=280.82s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=282.82s)]
*  That is hardening up the infrastructure. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=283.82s)]
*  It's improving the structure of living areas and making sure that energy and things like [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  water and other services can be provided. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=292.7s)]
*  I believe we're going to see these deliverables more coming out of the summit that would be [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  coming up. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  So this visit is one to help continue to set the stage for that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  I think the president would like to be able to make some comments about that on the climate [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=303.38s)]
*  front. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=308.06s)]
*  Then on the security front, I think I'm watching closely what's going to follow the Austin [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=309.06s)]
*  visit to Papua New Guinea, which is a very important large nation in the region, to see [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=313.02s)]
*  what that means in terms of expanded security ties. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=317.62s)]
*  The big security issue obviously is where the trip wraps up, which is in Brisbane, Australia. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=321.26s)]
*  I think from the Australian side, I've been reading some of the Australian reporting on [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=326.5s)]
*  this trip. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=329.78s)]
*  They are very much fixated on what is the follow-up, even though it is called OSMN, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=330.9s)]
*  is the AUKUS follow-up in terms of a timetable on Australia receiving nuclear submarines [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=335.70000000000005s)]
*  from the US. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=340.42s)]
*  There was some concern that the US might be, or at least the US Congress might be slowing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  down the process in which Australia is able to acquire what are called Virginia-class [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=346.42s)]
*  submarines, because the US itself is seeing it's shrinking in the ranks of its own nuclear [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=351.18s)]
*  submarines. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=357.18s)]
*  So I think they're going to want some assurances in Australia about the US coming through on [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=358.18s)]
*  this deal and providing the resources and the material that Australia sees as necessary [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=362.62s)]
*  to be part of this arrangement. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=367.66s)]
*  Yeah, that was one of the, one more of those things in the NDAA is that it's not that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=369.22s)]
*  they're opposed to AUKUS, but they think this is a way of squeezing the administration to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=374.46s)]
*  committing to building even more nuclear submarines. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=378.82s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=381.58s)]
*  Boosting the number of nuclear submarines from what is seen as, I think it's in the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=383.18s)]
*  40s right now, to something like 66. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=387.18s)]
*  So these are extremely expensive and obviously highly sought after. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=389.14s)]
*  So we'll see what comes out of this. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=393.02s)]
*  Again, the Australians are keen to see what the US is providing in terms of these, as [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=394.86s)]
*  you say, deliverables and a timetable and talking about basing as well. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  Again, Australian commitment to AUKUS is a big one. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=404.97999999999996s)]
*  They've been working strenuously to manage their relationship with China. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=408.06s)]
*  And by the way, everybody on this trip, the US, Australia, the island nations, they're [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  all trying to say this, this isn't about a zero sum game or we win and China loses. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=416.54s)]
*  It's more about managing all of these relationships. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=421.74s)]
*  But by the way, China is being coercive and we want to counter that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=425.02s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, it's a zero sum game. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=428.02s)]
*  You said it, not me, Carla. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=431.14s)]
*  Well, Carla, let's move over across the world to Colombia. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=433.42s)]
*  Next Thursday, the Colombian government and the paramilitary group known as the National [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=436.86s)]
*  Liberation Army or ELN will begin a six month ceasefire. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=440.38s)]
*  Now, this is not as large a group as what's known as the FARC, but it's still a very significant [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=444.70000000000005s)]
*  step to be made because this has been an ongoing battle that dated from the formation of the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  ELN, I think, in 1964. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=454.82000000000005s)]
*  So are we looking at the onset of further peace in Colombia, Carla? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=456.82000000000005s)]
*  Well, we will see. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=460.86s)]
*  Colombia has a really long history of internal armed conflicts. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=463.1s)]
*  At least 450,000 people are believed to have been killed in the country just between 1985 [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=466.82000000000005s)]
*  and 2018 and millions more have been forced from their home from a variety of different [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=472.18s)]
*  rebel groups, paramilitary groups, obviously, the drug wars and all of that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  So after Colombia's best known and largest group, the FARC disarmed, which was in 2016, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=482.06s)]
*  and we have to be clear here that there are still armed FARC factions out there, but the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=487.78000000000003s)]
*  main FARC has disarmed. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=491.9s)]
*  The ELN, which as you said, has been fighting since the 60s, took its place as the biggest [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=493.9s)]
*  remaining rebel group with approximately some 3000 fighters there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=498.22s)]
*  And last year, Colombians elected Gustavo Petro, their first leftist president, who [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=503.06s)]
*  promised to seek total peace. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=507.62s)]
*  And he's a really interesting guy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=509.38s)]
*  He succeeded a very rightist president, Ivan Duque, and he himself is a former mayor of [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=511.42s)]
*  the now disbanded M-19 guerrilla group. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=516.82s)]
*  He then became a senator and now the president. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=519.96s)]
*  And the key part of his appeal in this campaign was this promise that he was going to bring [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=523.14s)]
*  all these groups in from the cold. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=527.48s)]
*  And he's tried to negotiate ceasefires with five groups. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=529.52s)]
*  He's had limited success for them to hold, but this has been the big prize and the big [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=532.84s)]
*  main focus for them. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=538.2s)]
*  It's really important to keep in mind that this is a ceasefire, not a peace deal or a [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=540.36s)]
*  demobilization. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  There's a very, very long way to go. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  The two sides are supposed to resume talks next month in Venezuela. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=547.64s)]
*  And it's really hard to figure out what the ELN wants. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=551.52s)]
*  They obviously, they're there. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=554.36s)]
*  They said they're going to talk. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=556.12s)]
*  They use very general terms like participation and socioeconomic transformation and compensation [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=557.88s)]
*  for victims, victims, I might add, of the government, not from their own actions. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=563.6s)]
*  And the government has been hugely abusive. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=569.34s)]
*  There's no question that the Colombian military is also one of the armed groups that has been [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=571.2s)]
*  wreaking havoc in the countryside. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=574.64s)]
*  But the ELN has a very long history of brutalizing Colombians, kidnapping civilians for ransom, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=577.02s)]
*  forced recruitment of soldiers, including children and very desperate migrants. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=582.0s)]
*  They're heavily involved in the drug trade. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=586.56s)]
*  And according to the International Crisis Group, they've conducted social cleansing, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=588.52s)]
*  killing petty criminals and others it considers undesirable. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  So let's hope that the ceasefire holds and that they move on to substantive negotiations. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=596.56s)]
*  But another major question is what about those remaining armed groups? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=603.16s)]
*  Because not just the question of them negotiating with the government, the real concern is will [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=606.7199999999999s)]
*  they try to move into the ELN neighborhoods in the countryside, obviously, and the ELN [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=611.02s)]
*  will shoot back. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=617.46s)]
*  And for the civilians caught in that crossfire, I don't think they're going to care whether [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=618.46s)]
*  the folks shooting at them are government forces, armed groups, the ELN. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=621.98s)]
*  So we'll have to see. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=627.1s)]
*  Peace not exactly now. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=629.6999999999999s)]
*  Carla, I'm curious whether the large effort that was involved in reaching peace with the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=631.38s)]
*  FARC, and as you say, there's still some armed elements out there affiliated with them, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=636.5799999999999s)]
*  but that is a process that seemed to move forward. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=639.98s)]
*  Are there things that have been learned from that in terms of the disarmament, the repatriation [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=643.04s)]
*  or the integration of those groups into other parts of society? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=647.4200000000001s)]
*  Anything they can apply towards ELN? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=651.22s)]
*  And you mentioned Venezuela being a venue. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=652.98s)]
*  Venezuela had played a malign role in the past in terms of reportedly helping some of [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=655.74s)]
*  these groups. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=659.46s)]
*  Is Venezuela going to help at all? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=660.46s)]
*  Is it enough of a state that it can play that kind of a role? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=661.6s)]
*  Well, the Venezuela thing is a puzzle. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=664.5s)]
*  And one of the biggest puzzle is what's going to happen with the ELN members who are actually [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=667.02s)]
*  in Venezuela? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=672.3s)]
*  And does this ceasefire apply to them? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=673.9s)]
*  Are they going to come back now? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=677.1s)]
*  That's one of the questions there because they've been big fans of Hugo Chavez and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=679.02s)]
*  now Maduro. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=682.38s)]
*  So that's an interesting question. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=683.38s)]
*  Right now Cuba was the big country where the signing took place for the ceasefire, which [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=685.5s)]
*  is good for the Cubans. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=691.06s)]
*  It seems to be a new positive relationship between Colombia and Cuba for that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=694.46s)]
*  I don't know whether this Venezuelan government is going to do anything else. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=699.22s)]
*  It's a very interesting relationship more generally because even the Duque government, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=702.5400000000001s)]
*  the previous government, a very right-wing government decided that it was going to let [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=706.9000000000001s)]
*  in all of those migrants from Venezuela. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  Probably didn't have much of a choice. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=713.4200000000001s)]
*  So they have a very difficult and confusing relationship. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=715.24s)]
*  So we'll have to see if they can play any role at all. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=718.62s)]
*  They're not a particularly functioning government. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=721.12s)]
*  Have they learned things from the FARC peace deal? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=723.66s)]
*  You know, analysts are really mixed on whether that is a success or a failure. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=726.26s)]
*  Certainly there's a lot of people in the FARC who disarmed and a lot of people who disarmed [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=731.2199999999999s)]
*  who said they didn't get what they were promised. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=735.38s)]
*  A lot of people who disarmed who said that the military is still doing terrible things [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=737.9s)]
*  in the countryside. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=742.14s)]
*  There are other people who say that, well, all told this was a really terrible rebel [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=743.14s)]
*  group and a lot of people did come in from the cold. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=748.14s)]
*  So mixed bag there. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=751.16s)]
*  And this is a step-by-step process. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=753.68s)]
*  This is not an all-encompassing deal and we'll have to see how it works. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=756.78s)]
*  And one of the key things is that they didn't get everybody from the FARC to come in from [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=762.68s)]
*  the cold. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=766.16s)]
*  It was a much bigger group. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=767.16s)]
*  So I think they're just going to have to watch and see. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=769.36s)]
*  It's far too early to see whether or not there's any lessons from the FARC to be applied to [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=771.4599999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=776.24s)]
*  In the past, it was always from a US perspective when you talk about Colombia, the thoughts [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=777.5600000000001s)]
*  immediately went to, so how does this affect the drug trade? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=782.92s)]
*  But it seems like the drug focus has moved to Mexico and especially the fentanyl phenomenon [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=785.5600000000001s)]
*  as more threatening than Colombian cocaine. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=790.8s)]
*  But is that an overstatement? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=792.92s)]
*  Is Colombia still something to be mindful of in terms of being a source for drugs and [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=794.2s)]
*  a place where, quote unquote, the global war on drugs can be fought? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=798.12s)]
*  Well Petro doesn't think that this is a war to fight. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=801.8s)]
*  This is the other thing that he promised. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=806.12s)]
*  And other presidents in Colombia have promised this, that he wants to commit to rural development, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=808.44s)]
*  that he's targeting the financial operations that finance the drug gangs less focused on [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=813.44s)]
*  militarizing the war on drugs. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=819.88s)]
*  Everything's been tried, the militarization of it, the rural development, but rural development [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=822.84s)]
*  never had enough money, never had the gentle hand that was probably required to do it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=827.64s)]
*  But he has promised this and once again we'll have to see whether or not he makes any more [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=833.08s)]
*  progress than all the previous presidents who have promised this. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=836.56s)]
*  One of the biggest problems in the countryside of course has been the fact that farmers have [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=840.24s)]
*  been caught in the crossfire between the military and the guerrilla groups and the military [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=844.92s)]
*  and the drug traffickers. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=849.44s)]
*  And Petro has insisted that people have to be a lot more careful, whether he can really [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=852.16s)]
*  pull that off with the military. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=857.24s)]
*  But Colombians were thrilled that when the military and indigenous searchers got together [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=858.82s)]
*  to rescue those four children in the countryside, something we talked about. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=865.3000000000001s)]
*  And people saw that as a potential very hopeful possibility there. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=870.5400000000001s)]
*  Now whether that was just one bright shining moment or whether there's going to be a new [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=873.9000000000001s)]
*  possibility under Petro, I don't know. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=878.22s)]
*  It would be nice to get some good news out of the region, especially Colombia, so we'll [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=881.1s)]
*  keep an eye on that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=885.58s)]
*  Yep, would certainly be nice. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=886.58s)]
*  So Bob, let's talk about Thailand, another case of huge uncertainty. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=888.66s)]
*  Despite the success of Pita, and I'm going to blow this I'm sure, Lim Jaru Ing Rot and [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=893.98s)]
*  his progressive move forward party in May's election, the pro-Hunta, pro-monarchy conservative [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=900.38s)]
*  establishment still holds the levers of power and has refused to let Pita become prime minister. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=905.8199999999999s)]
*  So who can we now expect to come out on top? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=911.62s)]
*  Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who has been in exile for what, 15 years is [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=915.02s)]
*  supposedly coming back. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=920.14s)]
*  His daughter posted the news on Instagram this week. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=921.3s)]
*  Does that just make things even more confusing or could that perhaps lead to a better way [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=924.54s)]
*  of figuring out where this goes? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=929.5799999999999s)]
*  So very intriguing developments in Thailand. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=931.64s)]
*  I sort of tease the idea of a battle royale in my opening comments on the podcast, Carla, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=934.3s)]
*  but it is about, as you said, the move forward party's pretty unshakable commitment to trying [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=939.06s)]
*  to change, not to abolish, but to amend and sort of soften this Les Méges Tee Law that [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=944.82s)]
*  punishes anyone who insults the monarchy with up to 15 years in jail. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=950.6600000000001s)]
*  People have been doled out pretty severe sentences and it's also been by many accounts an abused [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=954.98s)]
*  law that has been used to target political opponents and so forth. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=961.0200000000001s)]
*  The country this week happens to be marking the 71st birthday of their monarch, who I'll [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=964.34s)]
*  call King Maha because I will butcher his full name. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=969.2600000000001s)]
*  So that's actually going to be a vacation for parliament in the coming week until August [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=972.58s)]
*  2nd in observance of that. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=976.5s)]
*  And then they are supposed to, on August 4th, pick up this question of approving a government. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=978.22s)]
*  The move forward party is part of a coalition. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=983.0200000000001s)]
*  It has seemed to have given the nod to its coalition partner, Pu Tai, which also did [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=985.38s)]
*  really well in the elections, to try to form a government. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=989.58s)]
*  There seems to be a sense that Pu Tai will be trying to gather enough support to get [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=992.6600000000001s)]
*  one of its candidates as a prime minister, as you said, maybe even someone like Taksin. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=998.28s)]
*  That would be really intriguing, but that's a separate topic. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1002.76s)]
*  First though, it's a question of whether Pu Tai is sort of making arrangements so that [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1005.92s)]
*  it will not come out and strongly call for amending this law on the monarchy, but in [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1010.4s)]
*  fact, we'll just try to get the democratically elected forces into power first and foremost [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1016.0799999999999s)]
*  and then go from there. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1022.0s)]
*  And Taksin was a hugely controversial figure to say the least. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  He faces actually charges that could put him in prison for up to 10 years. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1027.52s)]
*  And so him planning to come back, I think it's August 10th, adds a lot of intrigue as [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1031.6s)]
*  well. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1036.44s)]
*  And there could be incredible amount of wheeling, dealing going on, Carla, that we don't even [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1037.44s)]
*  know or not privy to. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1040.96s)]
*  That basically allows the country to maneuver away from this impasse over the move forward [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1042.8s)]
*  party and the monarchy legislation and instead come up with a compromise that brings a candidate [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1047.16s)]
*  that through various wheeling, dealing becomes more acceptable to the elite, to the royal [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1054.06s)]
*  slash military elite that has ruled the country for close to 10 years. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1058.6599999999999s)]
*  And that seems to prop up on a sort of decade long basis to seize power when it does not [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1062.54s)]
*  like the way the civilian leadership is going. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1068.26s)]
*  So it's hugely consequential as well. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1070.94s)]
*  This is a country that's a US ally. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1072.98s)]
*  It's the second largest economy in Southeast Asia and does seem to continue to play a role [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1074.46s)]
*  in the region that's been dealing with all sorts of problems, including the truly awful [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1080.7s)]
*  civil war in Myanmar, which continues to play out. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1084.6200000000001s)]
*  The succession of power we just heard about in Cambodia where Hun Sen will hand the reins [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1088.1000000000001s)]
*  over to his son, but still kind of direct things. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1091.5800000000002s)]
*  And so you have the chance for Thailand to kind of step forward democratically. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1094.5s)]
*  It would be nice for it to sort this out in its own way and you have a democratic Thailand [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1098.18s)]
*  emerge by the end of the summer. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1103.0s)]
*  So here we have Tony Blinken going to Tonga and I'm not minimizing the importance of [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1105.42s)]
*  that region in those countries, but you just pointed out the potential central role that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1111.9s)]
*  Thailand could play in Cambodia and Myanmar. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1118.3000000000002s)]
*  Is the US playing any role in this? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1122.78s)]
*  I mean, usually these anti-democratic maneuvering draws a very strong rebuke from the US or [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1124.7s)]
*  am I wrong? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1130.0600000000002s)]
*  Has the Biden administration really been low keying this one? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1131.0600000000002s)]
*  Certainly from what I've seen in terms of the statements, it's been asked at State Department [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1134.06s)]
*  briefings about these developments, about the blocking of the move forward party. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1136.94s)]
*  And they have been issuing in the sort of the language of the State Department briefing [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1141.34s)]
*  that the standard, we have faith in our Thai partners to sort this out for them and we [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1146.98s)]
*  support the democratic process there. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1153.74s)]
*  But they did have spokespeople in the State Department have also said they are watching [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1155.76s)]
*  the latest round of developments in terms of blocking the lead vote getter with what [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1159.94s)]
*  they say is concern. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1163.78s)]
*  I would imagine that it also includes a great deal of context that we're not hearing about [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1165.18s)]
*  Carla, but I think as you say, it's very high stakes that the administration has gone out [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1169.54s)]
*  and said democracy promotion is going to be a priority. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1173.98s)]
*  And yet it's finding again and again how difficult that is to be public with that when it needs [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  countries that are, let's say either struggling with democracy or even illiberal and they [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1182.42s)]
*  need it to support other ends. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1187.26s)]
*  So I think they would love to see a democratic Thailand emerge. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1189.22s)]
*  And again, I think there are probably discussions going on and I'm going to continue to look [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1193.1000000000001s)]
*  for nuances in the way the State Department talks. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1196.54s)]
*  You mentioned Secretary Blinken, you know, these affairs are also watched closely by [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1199.66s)]
*  places like Australia. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1203.34s)]
*  He could be hearing a lot from them about their concern about Thailand as well. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1204.38s)]
*  And so the wrap up of this trip could have a sort of a fresh set of issues that the State [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1208.76s)]
*  Department is going to be trying to prioritize Carla, but it is a good point. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1213.42s)]
*  There's been no strong sort of US leaning on the Thai authorities as of yet. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1217.82s)]
*  Well, Carla, we've talked our way into the audience figure of the week portion of the [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1222.1799999999998s)]
*  podcast and we're going to see a theme emerging in a minute. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1226.86s)]
*  This is the part where listeners can vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1230.6999999999998s)]
*  orgs Instagram story. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1234.5s)]
*  This week Carla, our audience selected China's Chin Gang removed after seven months. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1236.6599999999999s)]
*  What's going on with China's foreign minister? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1242.32s)]
*  No one knows and the announcements that he had been replaced only came a month after [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1245.14s)]
*  he disappeared from view. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1248.66s)]
*  And yesterday after the announcement came, they removed all mentioned from him from the [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1250.9s)]
*  foreign ministry website, you know, including any pictures or mentions of past diplomatic [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1255.3400000000001s)]
*  meetings with senior officials. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1260.0200000000002s)]
*  So this is a classic airbrushing of history move from a communist party and country. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1262.5200000000002s)]
*  But we really don't know. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1268.8600000000001s)]
*  At one point the foreign ministry claimed he had failed to show up for an ASEAN meeting [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1270.22s)]
*  in Indonesia because of health reason. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1274.06s)]
*  And there are rumors that he may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1276.46s)]
*  while he was ambassador in Washington that might have got him in trouble. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1280.8600000000001s)]
*  But nobody really knows what's going on and maybe they'll never tell us what's going [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1284.22s)]
*  on. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1288.22s)]
*  What makes us all the more puzzling is that Chin, who is comparatively young for a Chinese [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1289.26s)]
*  leader, he's 57, had a very powerful patron. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1293.5s)]
*  He leapt over a whole bunch of people to become foreign minister. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1297.1000000000001s)]
*  And only after slightly less than a year and a half as ambassador in Washington because [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1300.9s)]
*  of the patronage of Xi Jinping. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1305.52s)]
*  Now does it matter that he's out? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1309.26s)]
*  There was somebody a lot more powerful in foreign policy as we've talked about before. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1311.7800000000002s)]
*  Wang Yi has stepped in, perhaps temporarily, perhaps for longer we don't know. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1315.46s)]
*  And he's the country's most senior diplomat. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1320.26s)]
*  He outranked Chin because he's head of foreign policy for the party. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1322.66s)]
*  And he had the job before Chin anyway. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1326.66s)]
*  So probably not a lot of change in policy. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1329.78s)]
*  And there were all sorts of rumors that there was a great rivalry there as well. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1332.18s)]
*  That said, relationships do matter. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1336.66s)]
*  Chin was in Washington. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1338.62s)]
*  He had some relationships with US officials. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1340.34s)]
*  And interestingly enough, he traveled around the country a lot as well. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1342.66s)]
*  And if it's all going to be all Wang Yi all the time, it's going to be one fewer person [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1347.7s)]
*  for US diplomats to interact with. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1353.54s)]
*  And as it is, we have very few interlocutors on the Chinese side. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1356.16s)]
*  So we don't know. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1360.78s)]
*  And it could choke off even more conversation. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1363.3600000000001s)]
*  Do we have any sense whether this revives or sidelines the so-called wolf warrior diplomacy [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1366.16s)]
*  that's been getting so much attention from the Chinese side in terms of the sort of aggressive [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1371.76s)]
*  assertiveness and comments and other things? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1375.16s)]
*  Well, Wang Yi obviously has been very tough sounding. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1377.5600000000002s)]
*  But Chin was very much a wolf warrior as well. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1381.52s)]
*  There are a lot of people who thought that he was going to be committed to improving [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1384.8s)]
*  relationships with the United States. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1389.44s)]
*  And maybe because of that expectation, his rhetoric when he was in Washington was so [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1391.1599999999999s)]
*  wolf warrior like. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1396.1599999999999s)]
*  But yes, there are predictions that wolf warrior on the rise as well. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1398.28s)]
*  But once again, Wang Yi was always in charge anyway on it. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1402.48s)]
*  I think the great speculation is why was somebody who was so much an acolyte of Xi suddenly [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1406.24s)]
*  summarily pulled from view? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1412.32s)]
*  And what does this mean about the downgrading or further downgrading of the foreign ministry? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1414.72s)]
*  They have really handled this just absolutely terribly. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1419.52s)]
*  They haven't been able to answer a single question. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1422.36s)]
*  And they really are the interlocutors with the outside world. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1424.72s)]
*  They had a press conference about this. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1427.72s)]
*  You can imagine the poor spokesperson who had to answer question after question after [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1431.16s)]
*  question or more to the point was asked question after question after question and could offer [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1436.52s)]
*  absolutely no answer about what had happened here. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1441.04s)]
*  Why was Qin pulled? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1446.52s)]
*  Where is he? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1447.6399999999999s)]
*  And then when the transcript came out of that press briefing, there were no mention of either [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1449.06s)]
*  of those questions or the failure to answer. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1453.24s)]
*  Huh. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1456.32s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1457.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1458.32s)]
*  It does sort of contrast with this steady sort of messaging from China that the US has [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1459.32s)]
*  this chaotic political system and look at all the rancor and divisiveness and they should [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1463.32s)]
*  take a page out of the Chinese model where in fact the Chinese model has its rockiness [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1467.9199999999998s)]
*  as well. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1472.2199999999998s)]
*  Well, they're very good at yanking people off the stage when they want to. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1473.2199999999998s)]
*  But that usually happens at a lower level. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1478.0s)]
*  This is a pretty high level one and particularly for one who is so favored by Xi. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1480.54s)]
*  Still wondering what happened to Hu Jintao at the big Congress last year too. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1485.56s)]
*  And that was on camera. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1490.12s)]
*  That was on camera. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1491.12s)]
*  And we got to watch that one. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1492.4399999999998s)]
*  Well that's our look at the world next week, especially the world through the China prism. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTULNGg9lU&t=1494.08s)]
