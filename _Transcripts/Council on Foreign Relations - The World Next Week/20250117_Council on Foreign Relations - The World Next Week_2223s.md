**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE)

*  cfr underscore Oregon X. And thank you to those who've already written in. We will miss you too. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Here, here, we have enjoyed every minute of this. And we have a few more minutes here, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=108.4s)]
*  Carla, so let's get into the news. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=112.4s)]
*  Bob, let's begin with the breaking news out of the Middle East. As we often say on this podcast, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=114.48s)]
*  things could change before it's edited. Israel and Hamas may or may not have reached a ceasefire [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  deal that is supposed to bring the first real pause in the fighting in 15 months. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=126.48s)]
*  In its first stage, it is supposed to lead to the release of dozens of Israeli hostages [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=130.88s)]
*  and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Should we expect the deal to go through [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=135.52s)]
*  in the next few days? And does this look to you like the beginning of the end of the war? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=140.0s)]
*  I'll answer the second question first. I would be very cautious in saying that. And it's the word of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=144.88s)]
*  many seasoned regional experts is that we should not be expecting the end of the war, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  including a couple of our colleagues who just had a media briefing for CFR, Steven Cook and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=156.4s)]
*  Elliott Abram, who were saying that there are so many pitfalls here. The animosities between the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  two sides certainly have not subsided and there's any number of ways in which spoilers could [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=165.28s)]
*  disrupt this deal. But just to recap, as you indicated, Carla, the deal calls for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=171.04s)]
*  three phases. The first phase is a six-week ceasefire that is supposed to begin this Sunday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=175.76s)]
*  Now, the latest report we heard from Israel is that there will not be a cabinet meeting convening [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=180.8s)]
*  today, Thursday, as we're taping this podcast, until Israel figures out and clarifies a way of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=185.28s)]
*  securing its withdrawal from Gaza. It is particularly interested in making sure that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=191.84s)]
*  it is able to prevent any sort of shipment of arms into Hamas fighters in Gaza as this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=196.4s)]
*  process takes place. So just one indication of how difficult this deal is. Hamas is due to release [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=202.08s)]
*  on the first phase 33 Israeli hostages. This includes women, children, and men over 50. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=207.68s)]
*  And as with each phase, it's not completely clear how many of these hostages are alive or how many [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  of these constitute bodies of hostages. This is all going to be part of a very emotionally [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=219.52s)]
*  wrenching process as families find out who survived. And then, you know, Israeli troops [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=224.24s)]
*  are supposed to withdraw from densely populated areas in Gaza if they sort out the security [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=230.24s)]
*  areas that still seem a little bit nebulous. And then humanitarian assistance was supposed to begin [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=235.68s)]
*  two population areas in Gaza with hundreds of trucks entering. There have been repeated [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  reports about the dire situation facing Palestinians in Gaza. Certainly this time of year [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=245.28s)]
*  just makes that even more of a concern. And so there's a great deal of interest in making [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=250.4s)]
*  this happen. I would just say phase two is supposed to be the stage when remaining living [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=255.12s)]
*  hostages are to be released, including male soldiers and Israeli forces are to withdraw [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=260.24s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip. But again, the Israeli officials, especially officials from the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=264.8s)]
*  hardline right government that is governing the country, have not agreed to a complete [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=271.28s)]
*  withdrawal until Hamas's military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas says it will [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=275.52s)]
*  not hand over last hostages until Israel removes all of its troops. There's this question of what [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=280.08s)]
*  comes first here, which is going to bedevil this process pretty steadily. So bottom line is this [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=284.88s)]
*  Sunday, I think it's going to be a very difficult path to having this actually begin this Sunday. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=290.32s)]
*  The only thing I'll add is that we are at this moment because the incoming Trump administration, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  which has its inauguration on Monday, has made this a priority. President Trump said there will [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=300.72s)]
*  be hell to pay if this deal is not reached. He has already dispatched his named envoy, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, to take part in the talks. He's actually in an extraordinary set of collaborations [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=309.92s)]
*  taking part with the outgoing Biden administration on pressuring the sides. Qatari Egyptian officials [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=314.8s)]
*  have also been part of these talks and there is a great deal of pressure brought to bear. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  The other thing that's different from when many of the contours of this deal were released many [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  months ago is that Israel is in a bit of a stronger position. It has eliminated some of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=330.0s)]
*  the top tier threats from Hezbollah. In Syria, the situation has changed dramatically. The Assad [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=335.84s)]
*  government no longer rules there. Israel is feeling in a much stronger position and maybe [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=341.36s)]
*  feels like it can now move forward, but there are so many steps still to come. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=346.24s)]
*  Hell to pay is a really interesting formulation. This deal really doesn't look much different [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=350.64s)]
*  from the one President Biden announced back in May. Yes, this is the result of actions both on [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=355.28s)]
*  the part of the Biden administration, which has been negotiating for months and months and months. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=362.96s)]
*  The last minute remarkable coordination between the incoming Trump administration people and the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=367.2s)]
*  outgoing Biden administration people. But when President Trump said hell to pay, I think my [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=373.76s)]
*  first reaction was that it was a warning to Hamas. But I think if you look at it now, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=379.44s)]
*  in many ways it was a warning to the Israelis. That if they were going to take Trump for granted, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=385.44s)]
*  Trump said he wanted this war over before he came in. And that while Netanyahu has certainly always [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=390.32s)]
*  seen, even though Biden has spent decades and decades totally committed to Israel, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=398.56s)]
*  racing to Israel right after the October 7th attacks, I think that the signal from Trump has [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=403.2s)]
*  don't take for granted that we're going to back you completely if you want to prolong this war, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=409.52s)]
*  which then raises this question of are they feeling pressure even now to move forward with this? Or [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  potentially Netanyahu's government could fall over this? And what's the message even now from [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=420.08s)]
*  the Trump people? So hell to pay not solely on Hamas. Yeah, it's interesting you raise that, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  Carl. I had the same reaction in terms of how to read that line. And it very much is the case that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=431.84s)]
*  as we saw in the initial reaction, the incoming president was quick to respond and take credit [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=438.4s)]
*  for the deal on truth social. And it has been widely pointed out that he would not only like [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=442.96s)]
*  to have a deal, but also among these hostages being released are Americans who were taken at [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=447.76s)]
*  the time. So he wants to be able to say he was the one who, true to his word, brought peace to one of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  the most intractable conflicts besetting the world in the last years of the Biden administration, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=458.32s)]
*  and brought Americans to safety. What that means for any sort of lasting solution, and this was our [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=463.6s)]
*  colleagues got into in the media briefing today, Carla, this is going to take an incredible [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  investment in time and energy and pressure from the Trump administration. And it's not clear at all [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=473.6s)]
*  that it will be invested in such a way. It could just be it is looking for this temporary cessation. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=478.24s)]
*  And then we're back to a situation of a grinding conflict. So we'll have to see where this plays [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=484.8s)]
*  out and how much capital is expended to bring us to some sort of case where there is a pause, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=489.84s)]
*  and then there's some sort of movement towards a realistic future for governing [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  Gaza that allows for people to put their lives together and the Israelis to be satisfied that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=500.56s)]
*  Hamas is not going to be the power broker that it has been for decades. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=505.67999999999995s)]
*  In a speech this week, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said, quote, Hamas has recruited almost [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=508.64s)]
*  as many new militants as it has lost, which is a pretty grim assessment. I mean, this speech [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=514.32s)]
*  itself was a pretty, it was as frank as you could possibly get. Of course, he can afford to now that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=521.7600000000001s)]
*  he's leaving about exactly how tough a challenge lies ahead. Phase three is a comprehensive [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=526.96s)]
*  reconstruction plan for Gaza. And we haven't had any idea at all from the Israelis about [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=535.36s)]
*  what the governance is, no commitment to a two-state solution, no commitment to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=541.28s)]
*  what the Palestinian governance would be in Gaza itself. And Hamas has not, it's been certainly [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=546.16s)]
*  hugely weak and the Israelis are in a much stronger situation across the region itself. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=551.92s)]
*  And the Israelis themselves can't agree even within not just the hard right versus Netanyahu [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=556.72s)]
*  between the military leadership in Israel, the IDF leadership, which does not want to occupy [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=562.0s)]
*  Gaza indefinitely. And with Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=566.88s)]
*  there is a huge, huge challenge there. I don't think the IDF wants to occupy Gaza and have to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=574.32s)]
*  deal with that. So probably not the beginning of the end, many governance challenges. And if [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=580.24s)]
*  Netanyahu can't agree within his own government, can't agree with the IDF, there are many, many [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=586.16s)]
*  challenges they have to figure out. And Gaza is really not a prize for anybody. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=590.88s)]
*  No, and one of the things you touched on is going to be extremely interesting to watch in the period [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=595.44s)]
*  forward, which is aside from whatever the Trump administration decides to do is how are the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=600.72s)]
*  Israelis themselves going to sort out their contradictions and conflicts here? Because [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=605.36s)]
*  as you say, there are some on the extremist right that would like to pursue the scorched earth end [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=609.84s)]
*  game in Gaza and then set up Israeli settlements there and once and for all, make it a place to [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=615.36s)]
*  expand settlement activity. And there are many others though, as you say, who are aghast at the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=620.32s)]
*  idea of this sort of semi-permanent IDF presence in that region. Including the Israeli defense [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  leadership. Right. And you also have another party we don't talk about a lot, which are Arab leaders, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=630.32s)]
*  the Abraham Accords, which is one of the signature accomplishments of the first Trump administration [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=636.88s)]
*  in terms of a rapprochement between Israel and Arab states and potentially Israeli-Saudi agreement [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=640.6400000000001s)]
*  going forward. Are they going to be invested in any sort of process that allows Israelis to [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=646.72s)]
*  occupy this area and take these steps? Very doubtful. So there's so many elements that need [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=653.28s)]
*  to play out here. Again, do we have some sort of short-term respite, which is what I think people [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  are desperate for, for humanitarian, if not other reasons, maybe, but I think, you don't know. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  And release of the hostages. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=668.88s)]
*  And release of the hostages, yes. I mean humanitarian and human rights and the whole element there of [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=669.76s)]
*  just sort of real human tragedy that has unfolded ever since October 7th. The tax, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=675.5999999999999s)]
*  which again, were the worst tax on Israel in its history. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=680.64s)]
*  Carla, I want to turn now to the epic political transition that we alluded to coming into the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  United States. On Monday, President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated for his second term. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  Only the second US president to not have consecutive terms after Grover Cleveland, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=693.76s)]
*  Alexander. Mr. Trump has made a lot of day one pledges during the campaign. Immigration is [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=697.68s)]
*  certainly at the top of those pledges. What should we expect in these coming days? Can the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=703.2s)]
*  president actually make good on some of these pledges, including what continues to be promised [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  as the largest deportation operation in history? And this is referring to undocumented migrants. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=712.4000000000001s)]
*  Promised, threatened. President Trump has made a lot of day one pledges, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=718.08s)]
*  solving the war in Ukraine, all sorts of things. Although that one has now turned into 100 days, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=723.0400000000001s)]
*  conversation for another day. But a lot of those pledges have been about immigration. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=729.84s)]
*  He's vowed more than 30 times to close the southern border, more than two dozen times to [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=734.64s)]
*  begin this largest deportation operation in history. He's also pledged to restore and expand [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=740.48s)]
*  the first term travel ban on people from Muslim majority countries, to end birthright citizenship, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=745.76s)]
*  never mind that that's in the constitution, to suspend refugee admissions into the country, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=753.36s)]
*  something he did not do during his first term. So lots of pledges on immigration, lots of day one [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=759.28s)]
*  pledges on immigration. Can he do what he has vowed to do? He has always had a maximalist view of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=766.32s)]
*  presidential powers, and he's certainly going to try to use executive orders to make good on those. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=773.92s)]
*  These are really important political commitments for him. He campaigned really heavily on this. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=778.24s)]
*  So buckle up. But he's also going to face considerable obstacles. President Biden frustrated [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=782.24s)]
*  at least temporarily part of this by extending TPS, this temporary protected status, for some [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=789.36s)]
*  900,000 people from Ukraine, El Salvador, Venezuela, and Sudan, at least until October, 2026. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=794.96s)]
*  And I think that's going to be very hard to overturn. If you recall, in the first [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=802.32s)]
*  Trump administration, Mr. Trump ended TPS for 400,000 people from El Salvador and a few other [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=806.48s)]
*  countries, and the courts didn't let him do it. So maybe that's one thing that has been blocked. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=812.16s)]
*  And there are just really some basic resource challenges to this largest deportation in history [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=819.28s)]
*  pledge. There are just not enough immigration agents to track people down, arrest them, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  not enough judges to review their cases. And then there's the simple question of infrastructure. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=828.64s)]
*  We remember the horrors of the kids in cages and all of that. Public outcry is going to be enormous, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=834.24s)]
*  but they also just don't have the resources to do a lot of it. There are an estimated 11 million [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=840.72s)]
*  undocumented immigrants in the country, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deportation [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=846.08s)]
*  Branch only has 6,000 agents and 41,000 detention beds. And Trump's chosen border czar, Tom Holman, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=850.72s)]
*  already has been trying to tamp down, you know, enthusiasms on the Hill among Republicans. And [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=858.72s)]
*  he's just warning them that ICE doesn't have the resources. He's asking for money when he does this. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=864.08s)]
*  And then you, of course, have the whole question of the continuing resolution and the budget and [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=868.88s)]
*  where's the money going to come from. So I think the early plan is to target, there's about 1.4 [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  million people in the US with final immigration orders. A lot of this has already been resolved [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=880.0799999999999s)]
*  and they're going to go after them. And that's an enormous number and a lot of families wrenched [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=884.8s)]
*  apart and that, but it's not this largest deportation in history vow. But the president's [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=888.4799999999999s)]
*  committed to it and they're going to look at other ways. Trump said in November that he would [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=894.48s)]
*  get around some of these resource questions by using the US military. And DOD has traditionally, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=899.6800000000001s)]
*  they provided limited operational support at the border. You remember them, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=905.36s)]
*  where they're going to finish the wall. They've certainly used surveillance planes. They've [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=909.04s)]
*  moved border agents around in helicopters itself, but we have this- [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=912.64s)]
*  And national guard, there have been some national guard deployments. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=915.76s)]
*  Certainly, there's that. But using federal troops, there's this whole question of posse [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=918.08s)]
*  comitatus. National guard's not subject to that, but to do that, he's going to have to consider [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=922.8s)]
*  something like the Insurrection Act. And the military is not going to be happy with this. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=928.88s)]
*  It's going to be a huge politicization of the military. So how much he's committed to this [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=933.5999999999999s)]
*  politically, how much he's committed to this personally, hugely divisive potentially there. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=939.12s)]
*  But I think the bottom line is that they don't have the resources to do a lot of the commitments [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  that he's made. And he's going to have to make some pretty enormous divisive political actions [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  if he wants to get the military involved to pull this off. And then finally, there are the courts [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=956.8000000000001s)]
*  who are going to get in his way, one hopes, making an editorial decision here. Certainly, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=961.6s)]
*  to end birthright citizenship, he can't do this through executive action. He may sign an executive [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=967.0400000000001s)]
*  order, but it is enshrined, as I said, in the US Constitution through the 14th Amendment. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=972.96s)]
*  He could make progress legislatively, but not on that. We're seeing motion that's already passed [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=977.36s)]
*  through the House, and the Senate has this Lake and Riley bill, and the Democrats are allowing it to [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=983.6s)]
*  move forward at least for debate in the Senate. And this would require immigration agents to take [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=988.96s)]
*  into custody people who've been arrested for minor crimes, recently burglary, theft, larceny, or [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=995.12s)]
*  shoplifting. And it would mean that someone could be deported before they were even convicted or [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1000.8s)]
*  even getting the chance to defend themselves in court. And that too could really break up families. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1006.9599999999999s)]
*  So expect a lot of disruption, expect a lot of political commitments there, and how far he's [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1012.4799999999999s)]
*  willing to go from mobilizing the military to tossing people out who haven't been brought to [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1021.28s)]
*  trial, we'll just have to see. You know, Carla, they certainly feel like they had a mandate from [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1027.44s)]
*  the way they campaigned, and the election results and some of the exit polling we saw from voters [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1032.4s)]
*  about getting the border situation sorted out. At the same time, experts have pointed out that the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1036.56s)]
*  flow across the border has slowed down appreciably, and certainly in the last year or so, and that [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1043.68s)]
*  Biden administration itself has already moved vigorously against anybody, certainly found guilty [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1048.8s)]
*  of criminal activity. But as you say, this legislation couldn't move that further along. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1053.84s)]
*  We saw in the first Trump administration, one of the first things they did was the so-called Muslim [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1058.32s)]
*  ban, and certain people originating from certain states were banned, and that faced a great deal of [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1062.08s)]
*  pushback, especially in the courts. There was also people showing up at airports and demonstrating. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1067.76s)]
*  I think probably we should suspect something along those lines, wouldn't you say? Or at least [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  maybe using health as a justification, health care concerns as a justification. Maybe they'll [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1076.56s)]
*  claim that the fentanyl influx is too much of a threat, they have to do something. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1081.76s)]
*  I would suspect they've learned some things from the first time around, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1086.08s)]
*  and the way they've staffed up, at least to try to move, if not be able to sustain, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1089.04s)]
*  at least to move in that direction. We'll have to see how the politics of this plays out. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1093.52s)]
*  President Trump campaigned heavily on this. Polling has shown that immigration is top of [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1098.4s)]
*  people's concerns, even though the numbers, as you said, are down. At the same time, when it is [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1105.12s)]
*  your neighbor, someone you work with, if people really are using either National Guard or under [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1110.88s)]
*  the Insurrection Act, US troops to kick down doors and to break up families, people with kids who [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1117.68s)]
*  are American citizens, if we really do see those images, I don't know if Americans are really that [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1124.0s)]
*  ungenerous. I'm not sure that that concern about—it's one thing to talk about illegal [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1130.4s)]
*  immigration, it's another thing to talk about your neighbors. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1135.44s)]
*  I still believe that there's a fundamental generosity of the American spirit, and the people [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1138.88s)]
*  may at some point remember that we really are a nation of immigrants. We will see. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1142.48s)]
*  Using American troops for that, I think that we're going to see a lot of generals who are [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1147.36s)]
*  going to be really unhappy about mobilizing troops that way and politicizing the US force. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1151.68s)]
*  I think there are some really basic political and moral questions that are going to be raised for it, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1157.12s)]
*  and there are also economic questions that are going to be raised for it. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1162.56s)]
*  I was just going to say, Carla, there's a reason why that 11 million figure you cited, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  that figure has been pretty constant for I would say almost 15 years now, and there's a reason for [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1169.04s)]
*  that, maybe even longer, because there are industries that support them and want that labor. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1173.76s)]
*  We're talking about agriculture, certainly, construction. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1178.64s)]
*  Meatpacking. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1181.6000000000001s)]
*  Look at the construction needs that California is going to have soon enough after it tries to [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1182.16s)]
*  rebuild from the wildfires. Meatpacking, as you said, hospitality industries, these are areas that [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1185.92s)]
*  one suspects will speak up if they are finding an important source of labor to go away. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1192.88s)]
*  And it's not fair to people who are, quote, undocumented workers. These people pay taxes [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1198.72s)]
*  and pay in and don't get the benefits of it from social security and all of that. It would be good [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  to regularize these people so that they contribute enormously and they don't get the benefit of it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1210.64s)]
*  I'm not saying, yay, let's exploit these people, but yes, there are industries that are going to [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1216.48s)]
*  certainly say, if there's no one to pick my crops, if there's no one to work on construction, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1221.76s)]
*  if there's no one to cut meat in meatpacking industry, we're going to see the supply chain [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1226.4s)]
*  implications of this as well. Well, and inflationary pressures, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1231.52s)]
*  that's another cardinal rule that they would be violating because they campaigned on inflation, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1235.04s)]
*  and inflation, according to the latest figures, is still sort of stubbornly not where it should be, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1240.56s)]
*  and that would be a great deal of concern. So yeah, a great deal of pressure, emotionally fraught [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1245.36s)]
*  issue. It's going to be really, really interesting to see that among many, many other issues. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1250.0s)]
*  So we will see whether are the symbolic moves of sending the National Guard to complete the fence, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1254.4s)]
*  tossing people out who already have gone through the courts and already have these orders doing [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1262.56s)]
*  that, the president is fulfilling these commitments that he's made dozens and dozens of time, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1267.68s)]
*  or are they really going to go through and mobilize federal troops and start kicking down [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1272.96s)]
*  doors and breaking up families and putting people in cages again? We'll just have to see [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1278.64s)]
*  what they do. Certainly, there are a lot of hardliners in the administration like Stephen [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1284.24s)]
*  Miller who want to see that, and there are people on the Hill who are hardliners, and we will see [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1287.8400000000001s)]
*  where the American public, what the traffic will bear, and also we'll see how much court shopping [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1292.48s)]
*  they do. There are judges out there who are willing to challenge this notion of birthright [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1296.8000000000002s)]
*  citizenship as well. So there's going to be a lot of challenges to how Americans define themselves [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1300.72s)]
*  in the months to come. And there's that talk about that mandate, but I think that mandate, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1306.48s)]
*  I think a lot of people have very different definitions of what they mean by undocumented [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1311.04s)]
*  and quote, illegal immigration. Bob, let's move on to a very different topic, the ever evolving [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1315.52s)]
*  partnership between US adversaries, Iran and Russia. On Friday of this week, January 17th, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1322.88s)]
*  Iranian president, this new reformist president, Massoud Pesachin, is going to [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1329.44s)]
*  meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss their deepening economic [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1335.2s)]
*  and security cooperation. They're going to sign this treaty on comprehensive strategic partnership. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1340.08s)]
*  Now, they're part of this axis of autocracies. The Iranians have been supporting the Russians [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1347.76s)]
*  in Ukraine, but this is a relationship that goes back quite a long time. The Russians, I remember, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1352.8s)]
*  helped the Iranians basically resume their nuclear program, rebuild the Bushir plant. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1359.52s)]
*  At the same time, the Russians were part of the Iranian nuclear deal. They sort of played [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1366.4s)]
*  different sides of all of this. So how seriously do we take this pact, and particularly at a period [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1370.96s)]
*  of time in which Iran has to make some pretty big choices about how it's going to move forward [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1377.28s)]
*  in a weakened state? Yeah, I think it's a very serious development, but it's worth pointing out [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1381.84s)]
*  some things that are maybe not going to happen. Some of the reporting just today [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1388.4s)]
*  confirmed what had been expected, which is Iran has been saying that, well, yes, this is an [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1393.8400000000001s)]
*  important agreement, but it will not include a mutual defense clause, which Moscow had signed, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1399.2800000000002s)]
*  you might recall, earlier this year with North Korea. It has also done so with Belarus. Iran [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1405.2800000000002s)]
*  is not interested in binding itself into that kind of a pact with Russia, but it sees a great [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1410.8000000000002s)]
*  deal of other common cause areas that it wants to get involved with Russia. And it certainly has a [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1418.0s)]
*  military security relationship with Russia. We should note that that was cultivated and [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1423.12s)]
*  advanced in large part during their joint effort to help the Assad regime in Syria, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1428.16s)]
*  and they both were responsible for basically rescuing that regime, at least keeping it afloat [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1433.6s)]
*  for a good 10 years when it was facing big troubles during the civil war there. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1437.6s)]
*  Both countries were seen as some of the biggest outside losers in the fall of Assad, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1442.24s)]
*  in that Iran basically just lost an advanced beachhead for projecting influence through [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1446.24s)]
*  Lebanon to Hezbollah and onward. And Russia is still kind of scrambling to play the sides, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1452.72s)]
*  and whoever emerges as a sustainable power in Syria and whether or not it can keep any sort [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1458.72s)]
*  of military presence there. But they both forged a relationship in terms of cooperability. Iran's [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1463.6s)]
*  drones that has been selling Russia are a crucial part of the Russian war effort in Ukraine. These [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1469.44s)]
*  Shahed drones are just sort of a game changer for a while. The Ukrainians couldn't believe it when [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1474.08s)]
*  they first started seeing these things coming down on them, and they've been kind of reverse [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1478.56s)]
*  engineering them in some way to figure out how they work. Ukrainians themselves have been [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1482.72s)]
*  incredible manufacturers themselves of drones, and that's been a big part of that war. That [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1485.6s)]
*  relationship is only getting more intense between Iran and Russia. They are holding some joint [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1490.8799999999999s)]
*  military exercises in recent years. That's expected to continue, probably some broadening [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1496.48s)]
*  of intelligence ties as well. But economically is the area where the Iranians would like to focus [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1501.28s)]
*  on what they see as a big part of this deal. First of all, we should note these are two of the most [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1507.12s)]
*  heavily sanctioned countries in the world right now, largely driven by US efforts. Russia, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1511.44s)]
*  because of its invasion of Ukraine, Iran going back decades for all sorts of reasons, terrorism [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1516.32s)]
*  and otherwise, terrorism support. Among other things, it's worth noting in addition to [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1521.44s)]
*  collaborating on their fossil fuel sectors, they're both major producers of oil and natural gas [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1526.48s)]
*  that face sanctions. So maybe generating some shadow fleet capabilities that will expand on [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1531.6s)]
*  what they currently are doing. Both countries are able to trade even though they're under heavy [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1537.1200000000001s)]
*  sanction. But there's an international, what's called the International North-South Transport [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1540.4s)]
*  Corridor that would connect Russia to Iran. It would also link India, the Persian Gulf, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1544.56s)]
*  as well in a route capable of circumventing Western sanctions and lowering some trade costs [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1550.08s)]
*  It's not an easily done deal, shall we say, but it is something that has attracted a great deal [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1556.48s)]
*  of interest. And so they'll have this meeting in Moscow tomorrow as scheduled, handshake between [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1562.08s)]
*  Puzhezhkin and Putin. It allows both countries to say, we are not flustered by these sanctions [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1568.16s)]
*  and by these attempts to isolate us. On the contrary, we are ready to counter and be part [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1573.84s)]
*  of what you refer to this vigorous, although not self-named, but this vigorous axis of autocracy [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1578.88s)]
*  that stands to try to come up with a different approach to organizing the world and to countering [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1585.12s)]
*  the Western narrative at a time when there's a lot of transition going on, obviously. It's [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1591.28s)]
*  going to be very interesting to see how the Trump administration responds to this partnership deal [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1595.76s)]
*  as well. Well, Puzhezhkin has a pretty big question that he's going to have to contemplate soon, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1600.4799999999998s)]
*  which is, is he going to move ahead with his nuclear program or is he going to try to [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1608.9599999999998s)]
*  offer a deal to President Trump? President Trump, of course, in the first term had this [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1614.4s)]
*  maximal pressure campaign on Iran at the same time with North Korea. He would try to [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1618.8s)]
*  beautiful letters. So we haven't heard much about how the incoming Trump administration is going to [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1626.56s)]
*  deal with the axis of autocracy. And Puzhezhkin is supposedly a reformer. And given the way the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1632.88s)]
*  Russians bailed on Assad, you would think that Puzhezhkin might want to be playing all sides [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1638.72s)]
*  himself. So I'm wondering, why didn't he want a mutual defense pact with the Russians? Do you [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1644.8s)]
*  think it's because it's not worth the paper it's written on? It's a very good question. All I can [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1652.08s)]
*  say is that since the early days when the Russians were signaling this could be possible, the Iranians [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1656.8s)]
*  were just really keen on not getting drawn in in that way. I do think there's some truth to what [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1661.52s)]
*  I think you're alluding to, Carla, which is that having such a pact would seem to really [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1667.52s)]
*  complicate Iran's ability to enter into some sort of constructive talks with the US on at least [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1672.16s)]
*  freezing its nuclear program as is. It's worth pointing out, first of all, Puzhezhkin is not, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1676.96s)]
*  as president, does not hold the power that President Putin holds in Russia. Iran has a [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1682.32s)]
*  supreme leader, albeit aging. Ayatollah Khamenei, who is the ultimate authority on all power issues [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1686.96s)]
*  and has certain security agencies that report directly to him, Puzhezhkin is head of government. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1693.28s)]
*  He has some clout and he can generate some initiatives. He campaigned on and as the [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1698.08s)]
*  quote unquote sole kind of moderate, using that term very loosely, candidate in the recent Iranian [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1703.04s)]
*  presidential campaign, Puzhezhkin emerged as the one that the country could get around and has said [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1709.12s)]
*  the nuclear deal, which is reviving it, is seen as a way of opening up Iran and freeing up some of [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1714.96s)]
*  the sanctions. Trump has also not dismissed talk of some potential negotiations with Iran. Again, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1720.8s)]
*  he likes to fashion himself a deal maker and would be a real coup if he could come up with a deal [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1726.8799999999999s)]
*  with Iran that is seen as being more acceptable than what was known as the JCPOA under the Obama [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1732.24s)]
*  administration. We'll have to see. But back to your original question, I think potentially Iranian [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1737.12s)]
*  power brokers do not want to bind the country to Russia. You alluded to their long relationship. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1742.1599999999999s)]
*  I do think it goes back and it's very complicated and there is some wariness there too and I don't [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1747.68s)]
*  think they fully trust the Russians. So I just think they're not ready for such a relationship [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1752.64s)]
*  and have not been keen to kind of enter in those types of relationships in any event. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1758.24s)]
*  I remember in the way back years, in the early days when we weren't exactly sure what the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1762.72s)]
*  Iranians were doing with their nuclear program. And I remember being in Russia and the Russians [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1768.16s)]
*  were giving the, they were Russian engineers in Iran and they had had this Bashir nuclear power [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1773.6s)]
*  plant and they were helping them rebuild it. And I remember saying to people at the Russian [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1780.48s)]
*  nuclear power ministry, which needed the work, any work it could, the Russians were desperate [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1787.1999999999998s)]
*  for foreign currency in those days. And I said to them, you know, you guys are right next door. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1793.52s)]
*  You know, don't you sort of worry about a nuclear armed Iran. And they had this incredibly sort of [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1799.04s)]
*  patronizing, almost racist attitude like, you know, we could give them all the help in the world and [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1806.96s)]
*  they'd never be able to develop a nuclear weapon. I mean, they had this imperial attitude toward Iran [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1812.16s)]
*  and they'd never catch up to us. And I think it's sort of maybe that's part of it too. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1817.52s)]
*  The Iranians are very proud of their long proud history as well, looking askance. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1824.16s)]
*  The Russians bailing on Assad, as much as we talk about the way we build on Afghanistan, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1828.8000000000002s)]
*  that has got to have a, had a pretty searing, pretty searing message there for countries that [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1833.8400000000001s)]
*  are for that axis of autocracy. No, and it wasn't too long ago that Russia in its role on the [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1839.3600000000001s)]
*  Security Council took part in sanctions against Iran's nuclear program and then took part in those [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1845.1200000000001s)]
*  talks you referenced about, you know, requiring Iran to freeze its nuclear program in exchange [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1849.36s)]
*  for sanctions relief and so forth. So yeah, there's a bit of that Russian ability to play [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1855.04s)]
*  those sides and that sits with some Iranian officials who are in positions of power. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1860.1599999999999s)]
*  Carla, we've talked our way in once again to the audience figure of the week portion of the podcast. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1866.08s)]

*  beginning of November and killing 15 people. And they originally were calling out what they saw as [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1912.72s)]
*  enormous amount of government corruption in this renovation project at the station, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1920.3999999999999s)]
*  which interestingly was part of a larger Chinese modernization of Serbia's railway system. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1925.52s)]
*  But these protests quickly have turned into a broader condemnation of President Alexander Vucic's [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1932.24s)]
*  autocratic rule. Vucic holds the presidency and that's officially only a ceremonial role, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1939.28s)]
*  but he controls everything in Serbia. He controls the intelligence agencies, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1945.9199999999998s)]
*  the judiciary, the country's largest media. It's the power to award major state contracts. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1949.52s)]
*  And in November, Amnesty International reported the Serbian activists and journalists had [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1955.4399999999998s)]
*  government spyware installed on their phones since the protests began. Pro-government media [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1960.48s)]
*  has published personal information about the protesters. This guy is into everything and [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1964.48s)]
*  they're out there saying that their civil liberties are hugely curtailed. And this is [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1970.48s)]
*  pretty much the biggest challenge to his rule in more than a decade. His response to the protesters [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1976.56s)]
*  is this utterly dismissive quote. He said, they live in their own world. They're not my problem, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1983.84s)]
*  but I blame those who are pushing them about this. I mean, they're professors. As a professor, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1988.8s)]
*  I think, if only I had said power. He's also accused protesting students of receiving money [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1993.68s)]
*  from the West. And that also is quite intriguing because Vucic is a guy who has managed to win the [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=1999.2s)]
*  backing of both the West and of Russia. We've also, as you said, talked about all these different [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2007.36s)]
*  countries in which the Russians have been trying to push the Moldovans away from the EU and push [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2013.68s)]
*  Romania and have been pushing all sorts of places around. And he seems to be the one [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2018.72s)]
*  who walks through fire on all sides. He claims Serbia's future is with the EU. He signed several [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2024.16s)]
*  declarations opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but he also refuses to impose sanctions on Russia. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2030.08s)]
*  And so far, even though he has thousands of protesters on the street, he's not getting [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2036.32s)]
*  criticized from either Moscow or Brussels or Washington. If these protesters and these [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2041.52s)]
*  students are going to try and bring this guy down, they're not getting a lot of outside help. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2048.08s)]
*  Of all the developments in that part of the world, this one's especially interesting because the so [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2052.7999999999997s)]
*  called Balkan powder keg has been attracting a lot of attention recently, not just Serbia, but [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2057.7599999999998s)]
*  by extension, Serbs who live in Kosovo, which has not yet been recognized by Serbia, although it has [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2063.52s)]
*  been by a lot of other countries, as well as ongoing concerns in Bosnia where there are ethnic [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2069.12s)]
*  Serbs. This is not Milosevic era Serbia. This is a different Serbia. And as you say, the leader [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2074.72s)]
*  who represents a certain political stripe in that country that's trying to navigate these two worlds, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2081.04s)]
*  they very much want to keep ties with Russia, but at arm's length. And they very much want the EU [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2086.9599999999996s)]
*  resources and largesse that they see other countries in the region have. And it's a real [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2091.6s)]
*  test. Maybe it's because these other sides both want to have a stake there. They don't want to [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2097.2s)]
*  tip the scales too heavily. So it is yet another flash point that is going to play out in the year [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2104.16s)]
*  ahead. And we don't know whether these protests are going to get further legs because I think [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2110.8799999999997s)]
*  that's going to then force the issue. Because ultimately we saw in Georgia, countries in the EU [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2114.56s)]
*  and other places lining up behind the opposition figures and the now former president of Georgia. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2119.3599999999997s)]
*  But in Serbia, it's not clear. Well, he seems to so far, he seems to [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2126.3999999999996s)]
*  have lots of friends out there except for his own people. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2132.64s)]
*  Well, Carla, for one more time, that's our look at the world next week. Here's some other stories [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2136.72s)]
*  to keep an eye on. The World Economic Forum hosts its annual conference in Davos. And once again, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2142.7999999999997s)]
*  neither of us received our invitations in time to go. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2147.9199999999996s)]
*  Once the podcast is over with, I'm sure they'll be sending us invitations. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2150.56s)]
*  Looking forward to that opening up. And the Equal Marriage Act takes effect in Thailand, officially [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2156.24s)]
*  legalizing same sex marriage in that country. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2162.08s)]
*  The publications mentioned in this episode, as well as a transcript of our conversation, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2166.72s)]
*  are listed on the podcast page for the World Next Week on CFR.org. Please note that opinions [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2170.7999999999997s)]

*  Molly McEnany and Marcus Aceria with director of podcasting, Gabriel Sierra. And special thanks to [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2185.12s)]

*  Everywhere, Marcus Aceria. And this is Carla Robbins saying, so long and we will see you next week. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2196.0s)]
*  And this is Bob McMahon also saying, so long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, and we'll see you [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2202.7999999999997s)]
*  at our live and final show next Tuesday at 6 30 p.m. I'd like the word finale. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzb0IKFGNE&t=2208.0s)]
