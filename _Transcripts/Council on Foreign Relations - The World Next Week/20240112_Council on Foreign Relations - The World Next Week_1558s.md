# Taiwan’s Pivotal Elections, Apple Battles Regulations, Davos Addresses World Risks, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q)
*  In the coming week, Taiwan holds a pivotal presidential election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  A patent case could shake up Apple, and the annual Davos gathering tackles war, climate, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=5.0s)]
*  and disinformation. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=10.5s)]
*  It's January 11, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=11.5s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=28.0s)]
*  I'm Carla Ann Robbins. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=29.0s)]
*  So, Bob, let's start in Taiwan, which will be electing its new president and legislature [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=30.0s)]
*  this Saturday. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=35.36s)]
*  It's only the eighth in its history. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=36.94s)]
*  Democracy is still really relatively new there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=39.0s)]
*  And this is one of the most closely watched elections in a year with more than 60 elections [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=41.4s)]
*  around the world. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  So, what are the stakes? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  And this outcome going to have an effect, a major effect on US-China relations? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  So, first of all, Carla, stakes are very big, even though they're being called the status [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=52.0s)]
*  which can put some people to sleep. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=57.3s)]
*  The status quo is actually really important as it relates to Taiwan. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=59.66s)]
*  And this is as geopolitical as an election gets. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=63.14s)]
*  It's also kicking off what everybody's calling the year of mega elections. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=65.66s)]
*  And it's because of Taiwan's status. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=70.02s)]
*  It's because of China's aspirations, growing aspirations to bring Taiwan home, to unify [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=72.22s)]
*  what is calling an inevitable step. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=78.62s)]
*  And even though it's just the eighth election, as you say, with each one, you're seeing a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=81.3s)]
*  Taiwan as an entity that is one of the more impressive democracies, it must be said, in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=85.42s)]
*  terms of the way it carries out elections, the way it follows rule of law, the way it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=90.66s)]
*  governs its economy and so forth. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=96.7s)]
*  It has its share of issues, certainly beyond the issue of China. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  But that's really the big question here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Xi Jinping has been clear. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=104.06s)]
*  He seems to be running out of patience towards the process of unification. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=106.0s)]
*  This had been an issue that, as a recent CFR task force had pointed out, had a political [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=110.54s)]
*  framework that lasted more than four decades that partly existed under the terms of what's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  known as strategic ambiguity, has started to fray pretty seriously. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=120.30000000000001s)]
*  And so this is a question of whether Taiwan, China and the United States have a different [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  conception of Taiwan's relationship to China, but don't say anything about it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=129.58s)]
*  What these candidates are saying in this election, and it's a competitive three-way presidential [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=133.38s)]
*  in addition to parliamentary elections, what these candidates are saying matters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=137.78s)]
*  Every word they're saying is being parsed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  So let's just go really quickly through the candidates to watch, Carla, and then we can [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=143.68s)]
*  kind of talk about what that might mean. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  The front runner still, although it's seen as close, is William Lai of the Democratic [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=149.86s)]
*  Progressive Party. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=154.34s)]
*  This is the current party in power, and they've been in power for eight years. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=155.34s)]
*  Lai, who is the current vice president, has never said he's going to declare independence. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=159.3s)]
*  It's in fact, what he has said is he's going to continue to uphold the status quo in which [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=163.9s)]
*  Taiwan is already independent. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=168.74s)]
*  But China views him most unfavorably of seeing him as trying to continue this DPP policy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=170.74s)]
*  of wrenching Taiwan further away from China. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=177.34s)]
*  They have made it clear their preference for the KMT, the Kuomintang candidate, Ho Yew [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=180.9s)]
*  who is a former police officer who became the mayor of new Taipei city and has talked [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=186.72s)]
*  about more of a dialogue with China, having more communication with the Chinese Communist [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=193.28s)]
*  Party, trying to lower cross-strait tensions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  And his campaign has called for, quote, deterrence, dialogue, and de-escalation, end quote. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  And he has basically said it's an election about a choice between war and peace. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  In addition, there is a candidate, Ko Wen-je, of the Taiwan People's Party. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=211.86s)]
*  He is the former mayor of Taipei, and he is tracking a bit of an independent line, although [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  at times he's seen as being more sort of aligned with the KMT. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=221.86s)]
*  And it must be said that all three of these candidates, as I said, you support a status [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=226.74s)]
*  quo in which Taiwan continues along its undeclared independence from China. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=230.66000000000003s)]
*  There's no sort of rapid move towards unification, but at the same time, there are different [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=236.96s)]
*  approaches towards lowering the temperature with China. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=241.1s)]
*  And so there's a lot at stake in terms of whoever emerges, what they say coming out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=244.1s)]
*  of the gate, how China reacts, and then how the US further reacts. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  I'll say finally, Carla, that the US has been warning China against meddling in these [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  elections. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=257.98s)]
*  There was a White House press briefing earlier this week in which it said that Chinese government [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=258.98s)]
*  was trying to influence the results of the presidential election through disinformation [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=261.86s)]
*  and misinformation ops. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=266.86s)]
*  China for its part is saying the US needs to be aware of China's red lines in this matter, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=269.14s)]
*  that it needs to not formally pursue relations with Taiwan. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=274.26s)]
*  We had recent meetings just this past week in which Chinese officials reestablished ties [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  at the Pentagon. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=283.94s)]
*  There was a top Chinese Communist Party official who had been making the rounds, including [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=285.08s)]
*  stopping by the Council on Foreign Relations this week, where again he laid out the red [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=288.9s)]
*  lines. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=292.38s)]
*  Both sides are talking red lines. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=293.58s)]
*  It's just a question of, is strategic ambiguity going to hold the day anymore, or is there [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=294.98s)]
*  going to be some sort of more frank exchanges coming up after these elections? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=299.3s)]
*  So obviously this question about, even though it's the status quo election, this question [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=304.14000000000004s)]
*  about how they're going to approach China is central to the voters in Taiwan and absolutely [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=309.82s)]
*  central to how we think about it and how Beijing thinks about it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=317.24s)]
*  From my reading of this, there are a lot of voters in Taiwan who are less obsessed with [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=322.29999999999995s)]
*  this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=326.61999999999995s)]
*  They're like normal voters anywhere. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=327.61999999999995s)]
*  They're concerned about the economy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=329.7s)]
*  And I gather that that's the big appeal of this third party, this third choice candidate [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=331.5s)]
*  who's talking more about housing prices and all of that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=336.34s)]
*  Is this person going to potentially be the kingmaker or is this person going to have [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  a chance of winning? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  Is this co- [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=345.41999999999996s)]
*  This is co-. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=346.41999999999996s)]
*  It's what makes this an intriguing race. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  And again, there's not a lot of elections even in the most democratically open societies [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=348.7s)]
*  where you really have choices and pretty solid choices, although all three of these candidates [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=354.02s)]
*  don't have much of a foreign policy track record per se. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=358.62s)]
*  They are well known locally. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=361.58s)]
*  They've held important positions and have something to say. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=362.74s)]
*  So co-party certainly, the Taiwan People's Party or TPP could be playing a role in terms [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=366.02s)]
*  of making common cause with the KMT in parliament, for example, or taking votes away from the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=371.58s)]
*  in the presidential race. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=377.58s)]
*  There's kind of an interesting cross-section of influences that are going on here. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=378.58s)]
*  So I do think there's these two things we need to watch. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, the president being the most important position. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=385.97999999999996s)]
*  We want to see what's emerging in Taiwan and what kind of messaging and what kind of efforts [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=388.38s)]
*  to calm the waters, so to speak, literally and figuratively are taking place. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=392.5s)]
*  And then a question of how much there's a pragmatic sort of locally focused approach [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=396.76s)]
*  to these elections. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=401.62s)]
*  As you said, the economy, although envious in some respects compared to some other struggling [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=402.62s)]
*  countries, still there's housing price issues, there's inequality issues. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=407.06s)]
*  There's also the issue of something we should also mention, Carla, which is the country's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=411.42s)]
*  outsized role in creating really sophisticated chips. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=415.3s)]
*  And the dominance of the world market is not to be understated. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=419.42s)]
*  And it's seen as one of the issues that could especially focus attention if there are growing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=422.82s)]
*  frictions after these elections. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=428.38s)]
*  And let's say China holds ramped up military demonstrations or there's anything that sort [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=429.86s)]
*  of crimps the trade on the semiconductor trade. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=435.4s)]
*  This is something that affects the entire world, including China, including the United [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  States. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=442.76s)]
*  The candidates have been very carefully talking about the trade in semiconductors and diversifying [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=443.76s)]
*  it because they have trade across the street with China on these. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  But in a way in which it's about diversifying an important product and not so much taking [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=453.14s)]
*  a strategically important product away from Chinese control. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=458.38s)]
*  So lots playing out again, back to your original question, the geopolitics are huge here. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=461.58s)]
*  Finally, we should say that the Biden administration has said there's going to be an informal visit [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=466.58s)]
*  of US officials post-election at some point in a time to be determined. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=470.46s)]
*  Former officials coming as they have in previous years, and they say China should not be concerned [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=475.34s)]
*  about that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=481.0s)]
*  This has happened before. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=482.0s)]
*  But again, China seems to be changing the parameters of the red lines a bit. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=483.0s)]
*  And we're going to have to see how all sides are able to kind of soothe things after these [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, this is the Biden administration's paying no attention to what's going on over here. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=492.14s)]
*  We're trying to get good relations over there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=498.12s)]
*  This is an incredibly challenging balancing act and will continue to be one. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=499.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=503.96000000000004s)]
*  And so we will watch very closely again, as the results come in, we're going to see them [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  rather quickly over this coming weekend. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=508.94s)]
*  And then we'll see the messaging out of Beijing, out of Washington and could emerge next week [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  in a different kind of a world or in a world in which everybody's able to take a sigh of [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=516.28s)]
*  relief at status quo persisting. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=520.32s)]
*  And I should note for our listeners, a really good rundown on these elections is from our [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  colleague David Sachs, both in our affiliated podcast, The President's Inbox, which went [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=526.48s)]
*  out this week, as well as a series of blog posts profiling the Taiwanese presidential [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=530.7600000000001s)]
*  candidates and a new interactive looking at what a potential military confrontation could [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=534.9200000000001s)]
*  look like. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=540.12s)]
*  It's all really good contextual info. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=541.12s)]
*  And in his spare time, David also wrote a really good piece for foreign affairs, kind [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=543.12s)]
*  of laying out what's at stake in these elections. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=546.32s)]
*  So please check out cfr.org and foreignaffairs.com. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=548.2s)]
*  You know, Carla, one thing we don't talk enough about on this podcast about is patent law. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=550.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, like every day I wake up and think, why aren't we talking more about patent law? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=555.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, here's the chance. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=559.72s)]
*  We do talk about tech innovations. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=562.12s)]
*  There's a through line here. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=563.72s)]
*  So many of us are familiar with the Apple watch. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=564.72s)]
*  I have one. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't wear it as much as I should. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  I have mine on right now. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=569.48s)]
*  You do? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=571.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  Outstanding. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=573.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm sure it's reminding you about getting up and walking around, throbbing every five [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=574.0400000000001s)]
*  minutes. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=577.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=578.4s)]
*  But the Apple watch is under scrutiny. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=579.4s)]
*  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency could put a stop to the sale of the newest [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=580.88s)]
*  Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple watches due to a violation of patent law. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  Are we seeing a sense of toughening of Washington's position toward big tech in this respect? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=589.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's, you know, I find a lot of things about this really fascinating about [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=594.72s)]
*  relationship with big tech and of course the anguish about how much news it made when just [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=599.48s)]
*  before Christmas Apple was ordered by the U.S. International Trade Commission to stop [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  importing and selling two of its watches. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  You mentioned the Series 9 and the Ultra because they were found to be infringing on patents [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  held by a medical tech company because the watch uses blood oxygen levels to detect a [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=618.16s)]
*  wearer's pulse rate. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=623.04s)]
*  This company, Massimo, argued that Apple stole its employees and technology to enable this [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=624.94s)]
*  build. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=630.4s)]
*  Under this order, Apple briefly suspended sales of the watches online in their retail [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=632.16s)]
*  stores, and the federal appeals court then agreed to delay enforcement of the ruling [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=636.0s)]
*  while Apple appealed. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=640.4s)]
*  And consumers said, oh, thank God, it's Christmas. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  We can all go out and buy more Apple watches. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=644.36s)]
*  But Apple has been using the time to redesign the software to avoid the patent infringement. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  And the company that brought the case says it's going to require both software and hardware [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=653.0799999999999s)]
*  changes, but what the U.S. Customs and Border Protection is going to announce on January [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=657.56s)]
*  12th is whether or not it approves this workaround. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=661.8s)]
*  And if it does, Apple could sell the redesigned watches. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=664.88s)]
*  And if it doesn't, more anguish to come, I suppose. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=668.68s)]
*  What this tells us is a few things. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  One is this continuing mystique of Apple products. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=675.3199999999999s)]
*  Their sales were down last year, but I must confess, I'm a devotee. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=677.6999999999999s)]
*  I have basically an all-Apple household. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=681.56s)]
*  And the other thing about this story that really fascinates me is how much news this [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=684.8399999999999s)]
*  made. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=689.24s)]
*  In Europe, the EU is constantly battling big tech companies. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=690.48s)]
*  They're doing it in court. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=693.32s)]
*  They're doing it legislatively. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=694.32s)]
*  And under the EU's latest regulations, this Digital Markets Act, which is intended to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=696.32s)]
*  promote greater competition, you know, starting in March 5, major U.S. tech companies, Apple, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=700.88s)]
*  Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and China's ByteDance, the one that owns TikTok. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=707.16s)]
*  These are all so-called gatekeeper service providers. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=712.72s)]
*  We've talked about this before. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=715.08s)]
*  They're going to be required to make their messaging apps work with competitors' products. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=716.28s)]
*  And that means that users are going to be able to choose which ones they want installed [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=720.36s)]
*  on their devices. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=723.52s)]
*  So there's a lot more going on in Europe than is going on here in terms of going up [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=724.88s)]
*  against big tech. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=731.08s)]
*  But I don't want to overstate the good times here for the tech companies, not just on this [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=732.96s)]
*  Apple ruling. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=736.2s)]
*  The Times reported last week that the Justice Department is in the late stages of an antitrust [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=737.6s)]
*  investigation into Apple. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=741.36s)]
*  And they could file what the Times says is a sweeping antitrust case that could come [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=743.44s)]
*  as soon as the first half of this year. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=747.32s)]
*  So not the level of regulation in Europe, but it seems like the Justice Department and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=749.72s)]
*  other regulators are beginning to get on the case. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=754.28s)]
*  So it's important as a bellwether decision, obviously. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=757.44s)]
*  What about to Apple's bottom line? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=760.9200000000001s)]
*  Has it been able to diversify other products enough that it can sort of shoulder a blow [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=762.32s)]
*  to the watch, or is this going to be something that a major U.S. tech company is going to [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=767.52s)]
*  have to kind of recoil from potentially? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=771.32s)]
*  Well, one of the rulings that the Trade Commission said was, we're not persuaded that two [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=773.12s)]
*  watches is going to have much of an effect on you. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=779.4s)]
*  They make a lot more things. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=781.52s)]
*  Now, on the antitrust case, we'll see. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=783.6s)]
*  And justice investigators are looking at how the Apple Watch, you know, they basically [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=788.2s)]
*  crowd out everybody. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=794.16s)]
*  Apple Watch works better with the iPhone than with other brands. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  It hadn't even occurred to me that I could have another phone with my Apple Watch. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=798.72s)]
*  How Apple blocks competitors from using its iMessage service. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  That's one of the things that's going on with this new European regulation. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=805.96s)]
*  Justice is also looking at Apple's exclusionary payment system for their iPhone. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=809.32s)]
*  And, you know, these are things that they're looking at. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=814.1600000000001s)]
*  But as I said, they also have these antitrust cases against Google Search and against their [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=816.96s)]
*  ad tech business. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=822.88s)]
*  The FTC is suing men and Amazon. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=823.8000000000001s)]
*  So we may be going into a new era of legal cases in which they're trying to find more [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=826.08s)]
*  competition for big tech. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=833.56s)]
*  But we don't see as the level of regulation that exists in Europe. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=835.5999999999999s)]
*  And I'm old enough to remember when Apple was the upstart going against Big Brother [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=839.4799999999999s)]
*  and the famous ad during the Super Bowl of the Big Brother ranting on the screen and [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=843.28s)]
*  Apple throwing a hammer against it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=849.0s)]
*  Those are obviously long in the past. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=851.9599999999999s)]
*  And Apple, as you say, is this really important gatekeeper with the ability to Bigfoot hold [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=853.4s)]
*  developments and not to mention its App Store and other things. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=859.16s)]
*  Well, you know, these companies all say that the government can't regulate them or shouldn't [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=862.36s)]
*  be regulating because they're too creative and they're supposed to break things and that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=866.5999999999999s)]
*  we all benefit from them not having regulation. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=871.56s)]
*  But the reality is that regulation has always been absolutely essential for the development [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=874.4s)]
*  of technology as well. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=879.3199999999999s)]
*  After World War II, an antitrust suit force Bell Labs to patent the transistor. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=882.8s)]
*  These are all sort of very fundamental things. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=887.98s)]
*  There is a synergy that exists between the private sector and government and protecting [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=890.2s)]
*  us as consumers. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's what's going on here as well. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=897.4000000000001s)]
*  And also protecting smaller companies as well. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=899.8000000000001s)]
*  People don't get to innovate if they're Bigfooted all the time. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=902.1800000000001s)]
*  So I'm not taken aside. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=905.88s)]
*  I don't know in patent law who's infringing upon whom. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=907.1600000000001s)]
*  Yes, something to watch and watch. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=910.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=913.2800000000001s)]
*  So Bob, let's move our conversation to Davos. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=914.72s)]
*  This Monday, leaders of governments, businesses, civil societies will gather in Davos, Switzerland. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=918.12s)]
*  This is the 54th World Economic Forum. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=923.52s)]
*  And this year's theme is rebuilding trust. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=927.16s)]
*  With the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, the climate crisis, the rise of authoritarians, our anxiety [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=930.36s)]
*  about the US election, so many other problems. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=936.96s)]
*  How do I say this delicately? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=939.4s)]
*  Why should we be paying attention to this gathering of the rich and famous? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=942.08s)]
*  Well, it's a really good question. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=946.36s)]
*  And it's a question that's raised every year, especially by those of us who did not get [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=948.0s)]
*  our invite to participate in the snowy alpine reaches of Switzerland. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=951.28s)]
*  But it is important because amidst all of the images of bundled up business correspondence, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=956.9s)]
*  convening panels and things, and the jet set attending, there are important conversations [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=964.88s)]
*  that take place. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=969.54s)]
*  In the case of what's happening in Europe and what's happening in the world from national [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=970.78s)]
*  security, from warfare, from climate, you name it, there are really important conversations [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=976.14s)]
*  that need to continue to be had. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=981.26s)]
*  And this group of people coming together is an influential one. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=983.98s)]
*  I don't know whether rebuilding trust is something that's really possible, frankly, at this [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=988.3s)]
*  current level environment, but at least continuing the dialogue is going to be important. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=991.9599999999999s)]
*  And so you have in attendance the number two in China, Li Chang, is going to be there [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=996.14s)]
*  giving a speech. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1000.9s)]
*  French President Macron is going to be giving a special address. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1001.9s)]
*  Two top US officials, Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State, and National Security [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1005.1s)]
*  Advisor Jake Sullivan are going to be attending, as well as the Special Envoy for Climate John [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1008.74s)]
*  Kerry. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1012.98s)]
*  So those are important interlocutors for charters. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1014.22s)]
*  And then you have people like Javier Millet of Argentina, his first big appearance on [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1017.46s)]
*  the world stage. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1021.58s)]
*  What does this mean for his radical attempt to kind of shake up the Argentinian economy? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1022.58s)]
*  Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, who's now been reinstated. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1027.14s)]
*  What is he going to have to say about the AI revolution and safeguards for that? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1030.66s)]
*  It's worth noting that the World Economic Forum, which puts on the Davos gathering, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1036.14s)]
*  has announced in its global risk report that AI-derived misinformation and disinformation [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1040.8600000000001s)]
*  is the top-ranked concern in terms of its top 10 risks over the next two years. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1045.5s)]
*  That beats out climate change, war, economic weakness, and so forth. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1051.62s)]
*  Global economy, it's going to be noted, is in a bit of a funk. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1056.1399999999999s)]
*  Global growth rates, as the World Bank says, are kind of stalled at around 1.5%, 1.6% growth. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1059.22s)]
*  There will be top officials from the World Bank, from the IMF, from the WTO attending. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1064.82s)]
*  And you're going to just have this opportunity to talk about this whole host of affairs that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1069.98s)]
*  intersect just about everything. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1074.8999999999999s)]
*  Finally, there's going to be important discussion going on involving Ukraine, potential refiring [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1076.3799999999999s)]
*  of talks about what some sort of an off-ramp could mean for that war in terms of the peace [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1081.56s)]
*  process, although the one that they're going to discuss is one that Russia has rejected. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1085.76s)]
*  But Vladimir Zelensky is going to be there either virtually or in person. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1090.04s)]
*  It's not clear, rarely is until the last moment. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1094.6s)]
*  But there's going to be important interlocutors there on the Ukraine front as well. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1097.36s)]
*  And then the Gaza war is certainly going to be under discussion as well, and the concern [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1101.52s)]
*  about the spread of that as well as the ongoing misery taking place in Gaza. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1105.86s)]
*  So I guess a final way of responding to your question, Carla, is that talk talk is always [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1110.1s)]
*  better than war war, and there's going to be a lot of talk talk going on in Davos. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1115.32s)]
*  So there's going to be a meeting there about ways to move Zelensky's peace plan forward. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1119.12s)]
*  Do we think there's something significant here? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1126.6999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Gaza's sucked so much attention away from what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1128.6599999999999s)]
*  And then of course, we have the stalled USAID package and questions of EU funding for Ukraine [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1133.54s)]
*  all of that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1140.02s)]
*  Zelensky obviously is going to want to draw more attention back. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1141.02s)]
*  I'm not sure he's really ready to sue for peace. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1144.9s)]
*  How seriously do you take that conversation? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1148.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think the more important from what we've seen so far, and I have not seen reports [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1149.86s)]
*  of what if any Russian officials will be attending or Russians who could maybe carry messages [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1154.76s)]
*  back and forth. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1161.02s)]
*  So I have not seen a great deal of sort of optimism that his peace plan is going to gain [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1162.18s)]
*  necessarily, but I think it will be important for some of the things you referenced, Carla, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1167.92s)]
*  in terms of shoring up of support for Ukrainian aid, military and otherwise. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1172.2s)]
*  The EU is at an important point just a few weeks ahead of their next summit where they [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1178.04s)]
*  might have some sort of a breakthrough in the block by the Hungarian leader Orban on [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1181.82s)]
*  aid to Ukraine, although he is insisting that it be reviewed every year. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1186.46s)]
*  And Ukraine's backers want it to be approved in one fell swoop for the next five years, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  I think. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1194.36s)]
*  But it's going to be an important moment to shore up support. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1195.4s)]
*  And also, as they speak over there, there is an ongoing process in the U.S. Congress [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1198.8400000000001s)]
*  to approve a spending plan that could shore up Ukraine aid, among many other issues. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1202.96s)]
*  That's a fraught process as we follow the day by day dysfunction in Congress, but it's [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1209.52s)]
*  still something that's going to be watched very closely in Europe. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1213.76s)]
*  So I think it's more about those kind of sidelines, shows of support than any sort of direct momentum [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1217.3200000000002s)]
*  for a peace plan. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1222.64s)]
*  I could be wrong. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1223.64s)]
*  Good news, I think, if they can find a way forward on pushing a peace plan. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1224.76s)]
*  It's something we haven't really seen much of in the almost two years of the Ukraine [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1228.64s)]
*  War, but it's really high time because the misery is only mounting there as well. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1232.3600000000001s)]
*  If I had to bet, Zelensky will be there. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1236.44s)]
*  He really needs to be drawing attention back to Ukraine. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1239.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1241.96s)]
*  And our ongoing series of Will Zelensky show up, I think my bet would be yes. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1242.96s)]
*  We will check back next week. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1247.2s)]
*  Well, Carla, we've talked our way into the audience figure of the week part of the podcast. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1248.3200000000002s)]
*  This is the figure that listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1254.2s)]
*  org's Instagram story. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1258.1200000000001s)]
*  This week, Carla, our audience selected France's youngest and first openly gay PM. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1260.2s)]
*  So who is the groundbreaking prime minister? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1266.68s)]
*  So Gabriel Attal was Macron's education minister and before that the government spokesperson. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1269.44s)]
*  And according to opinion polls, he is the most popular member of Macron's government [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1276.32s)]
*  and more popular than Macron. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1281.16s)]
*  But when you think about that, that wouldn't be particularly hard because Macron, as we [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1282.96s)]
*  know, is not particularly popular. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1286.48s)]
*  And he's known for his especially sharp verbal skills. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1289.32s)]
*  His nickname is word sniper as well as his social media skills. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1292.28s)]
*  How do you say that in French, Carla? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1296.0s)]
*  Word snipelle. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1298.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1299.3600000000001s)]
*  Got it, got it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1300.3600000000001s)]
*  You know I speak Spanish. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1301.3600000000001s)]
*  Despite his firsts, he still looks a lot like his boss. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1303.68s)]
*  Both started out as young men of privilege who rose quickly in the ranks. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1306.8s)]
*  And let's not forget that when Macron was elected at age 39, he was the youngest president [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1311.28s)]
*  in France's history. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1315.92s)]
*  So Macron, whose term ends in 2027 and can't run again, is clearly hoping with this appointment [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1318.1399999999999s)]
*  to gin up some new excitement for his lagging government, especially before the EU parliamentary [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1324.16s)]
*  elections. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1329.56s)]
*  And Attal is replacing Elizabeth Bourne, who was only the second woman to serve in the [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1331.3999999999999s)]
*  position. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1335.8799999999999s)]
*  But she was really identified as is Macron in the public's mind with highly unpopular [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1336.8799999999999s)]
*  policies, most notably this legislation to reform France's pensions program. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1341.12s)]
*  And lots of other things that were jammed through even without a vote in the divided [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1346.2399999999998s)]
*  lower house, the National Assembly. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1351.52s)]
*  There's this weird thing in their constitution that you can get things through without a [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1352.9199999999998s)]
*  vote. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1356.3999999999999s)]
*  So I think this is all an attempt to get a little bit more excitement for the government. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1357.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think it's also a sign that up until now, Macron hasn't been willing to have anybody [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  else with a little bit of, well, in Spanish it would be called Pachanga, with a little [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1368.24s)]
*  bit of excitement around him. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1372.64s)]
*  And during the handover ceremony, Attal, who does not lack for self-confidence, heralded [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1374.4s)]
*  his own selection as, quote, the symbol of audacity. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1380.6000000000001s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1385.0s)]
*  I mean, France's presidential system, obviously, you don't hear often from French prime ministers [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1386.0s)]
*  in terms of going out in the hustings and speaking too prominently. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1390.72s)]
*  So could we be in for a new sort of approach to French messaging and governance where you [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1394.74s)]
*  have a prime minister, for the reasons you cited, Carla, being out there and being visible, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1401.5s)]
*  potentially warding off what could be encroachment from the French right wing? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1407.18s)]
*  I think that's why Macron chose him. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1413.26s)]
*  He was known for setting up live Twitch broadcasts and YouTube broadcasts and answering questions. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1416.14s)]
*  He's clearly a guy of the 21st century communication skills. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1424.06s)]
*  I think the question becomes whether Macron is going to be willing to, having offered [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1428.54s)]
*  to share the space, is going to be willing to continue to share the space itself. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1433.4199999999998s)]
*  He knows that he's got an unpopular government and he's clearly nervous about it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1438.1599999999999s)]
*  And maybe he really is looking past his own time in office and trying to build more of [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1442.22s)]
*  a legacy. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  But I'm still going back to the notion that he heralded his selection as the symbol of [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1448.46s)]
*  audacity. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1454.02s)]
*  He clearly has his own very, very high ambitions, political ambitions. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1455.02s)]
*  So here he is at 34, the youngest and first openly gay PM of France. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1460.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1465.3s)]
*  Let's see if audacity wins. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1466.3s)]
*  Well that's our look at the world next week. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1468.7s)]
*  Here are some other presidential stories to keep an eye on. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1471.22s)]
*  Guatemala's Bernardo Arevalo takes office as new president. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1473.86s)]
*  Iowa's Republican presidential caucus takes place. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1478.1399999999999s)]
*  And Comoros holds its presidential elections. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1481.26s)]
*  It is going to be really cold in Iowa. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1484.1399999999999s)]
*  They're talking about it being 20 below in Des Moines. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1486.1799999999998s)]
*  So we'll see very strong commitment to democracy there for the people. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1489.3s)]
*  Let's compare the turnout from Iowa to Comoros, see which one prevails. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTCsV_lE6Q&t=1493.1799999999998s)]
