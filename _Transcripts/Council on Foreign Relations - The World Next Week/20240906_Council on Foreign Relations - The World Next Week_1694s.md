# Gaza’s Troubled Cease-Fire Efforts, Harris and Trump Debate, Toronto International Film Fest, & More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70)
*  In the coming week, tensions remain acute in the Mideast as efforts intensify on a Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=0.0s)]
*  War ceasefire, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump square off in a much anticipated presidential [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=5.2s)]
*  debate and the annual Toronto International Film Festival features a host of indie films. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=10.06s)]
*  September 5th, 2024 in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=15.88s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=19.84s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. Bob, let's start in the Middle East where Hezbollah and Israel are [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  again pounding each other with rocket fire, renewing fears of a wider war. The Israeli [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=37.08s)]
*  Defense Force's recovery of the bodies of six hostages, it's incredibly tragic, were executed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=42.6s)]
*  in Gaza, ignited mass protests across Israel with many Israelis blaming Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=48.36s)]
*  for his refusal to come to an agreement with Hamas on a ceasefire for hostage deal. Egypt and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=54.88s)]
*  Qatar are working with the US to repair what they are calling a final ceasefire proposal, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=60.52s)]
*  of course we've heard about that before. With so much ferment and tragedy, are we any closer to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=65.04s)]
*  getting an agreement? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=70.56s)]
*  It certainly doesn't feel like that Carla, and it's hard to overestimate the emotions that are [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  accompanying this latest set of developments with the hostages. They were by many forensic accounts, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=77.0s)]
*  people who were alive up until closely before their bodies were discovered. So they were [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=82.44s)]
*  executed by Hamas. Hamas has indicated it would execute other prisoners short of a deal if there [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=88.16s)]
*  are troops bearing down on them. So this is part of what makes the stakes of this so high. Benjamin [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=93.48s)]
*  Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the families of the hostages, as well as members of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=99.12s)]
*  his right wing coalition pressuring him about a deal on the one side of families saying, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=103.76s)]
*  we need a deal, we are close to a deal, why can't we finish this? The right wing coalition saying, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  it's not cave, we're not going to give in to the Hamas terrorists. Netanyahu himself continues to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=112.04s)]
*  kind of navigate this. And the latest comments from Netanyahu, rather extraordinary this week, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=117.0s)]
*  he came out and basically doubled down on what has been a new line of argument about this corridor [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  that separates Gaza Strip from the Egyptian border. It's about a nine mile long strip known [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=129.4s)]
*  as the Fidel Fai corridor. And he's basically saying they are not going to leave this on [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=133.4s)]
*  patrol, that they are not going to just pull out and leave it to Hamas to, in his words, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=139.16s)]
*  funnel in weapons and continue to mount their war against Israel. So apparently this corridor was not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=144.52s)]
*  even mentioned in previous deals that Israel had reportedly signed on to, that many especially US [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=151.56s)]
*  negotiations have said is 90% done. But boy, that 10% is sure compelling in terms of now what to do [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=157.16s)]
*  about whether or not there are going to be any sort of patrols in this corridor. And then there's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=164.76s)]
*  another issue that continues to be a tough one to sort out, which is the amount of Palestinians who [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=170.36s)]
*  are being held by Israelis to be released. I think the number is close to 800 at this point. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=175.88s)]
*  So there are about 100 or so hostages still being held. It's not sure how many are still alive, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=179.88000000000002s)]
*  although the six who were just executed showed that there certainly are some that are still alive. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=185.08s)]
*  And it gets to the broader point too that you mentioned, Carly, which is there is a hot conflict [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  going on, whether it's between Israeli and Hezbollah forces. And by the way, that conflict has now killed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=197.0s)]
*  more than 500 people by recent reports. There are intensified Israeli activities against what it says [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  are Hamas rebels within the West Bank. And there continue to be attacks from the Yemen-based Houthis [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=207.48s)]
*  on Red Sea shipping and when they can against Israeli targets, just to name a few areas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=214.28s)]
*  So- And the fact that we still haven't seen the Iran retaliation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  And we haven't seen this much anticipated, right? What will Iran do for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  in Tehran during the inauguration of its new president? So there's so many different fronts [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=229.64s)]
*  here, so much anxiety. And this is a potential as bad as it's been in the last 11 months or so, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=234.92s)]
*  since the October 7th Hamas attacks on Israel. There's potential to get worse, which is why the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=241.32s)]
*  US in particular is really keen to try to bring this to an end. Israeli public, what Hamas did was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  just absolutely horrifying, I mean, executing these hostages as IDF forces were bearing down on them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=252.2s)]
*  And since then, they've released these videos and taking coerced from the hostages, incredible [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  psychological torture of the families and the Israeli public. But Israelis are blaming Netanyahu [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=263.72s)]
*  for being the obstacle to a hostage for ceasefire deal. The US, President Biden has been quite [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=270.36s)]
*  critical of Netanyahu for seeming to agree to a deal and then going back on it. He has faced [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=277.88000000000005s)]
*  fierce protests before. Let's remember before October 7th, the country was riven, huge divisions [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=285.0s)]
*  over this judicial reform, not a popular guy. And he's faced fierce protests before over the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=290.92s)]
*  failure to get a ceasefire. But these protests seem to be different to me in the last few days. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=297.56s)]
*  The public anger is just really, really high. And not just at Hamas, but at Netanyahu himself, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=302.68s)]
*  is there any sign he's losing his grip on power or more willing to compromise? You use the term [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=309.32s)]
*  doubling down. Is he just refusing to do anything about it? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  If nothing else, you look at the career of someone like Netanyahu, and he's a very skillful [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=318.84s)]
*  politician, a survivor, and he is standing now on the pillar of Israeli existential survival. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  And he's taken on this issue of this corridor as a key sticking point. And I think he's going to try [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=332.44s)]
*  to ride it as much as he can. The pressure is, again, incredibly intense and reports you're [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  hearing out of Israel showing just really wrenching response of family members, both of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=343.56s)]
*  hostages, people not even directly connected to hostages. There's just a great deal of concern [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=349.48s)]
*  in Israeli society. There's a lot of other things going on too. You mentioned the judicial reform [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=354.92s)]
*  aspect. There's also an issue coming to a fore about whether Orthodox Jewish Israelis can [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  serve in the military or not. Or should serve. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=364.44s)]
*  Should serve and should be compelled to serve. So issues like that are playing out. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=367.0s)]
*  There's a right-wing coalition, as we talked about before, that is leading the government. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=372.6s)]
*  They were elected there, so there is a portion of the population that supports that. There are [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  settlers who are also creating difficulties in the West Bank, and in some cases, taking actions in [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=382.04s)]
*  their own hands against Palestinians. And so that adds to the difficulties in the country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=387.32000000000005s)]
*  And so I would say Netanyahu has shown again and again his ability to survive all this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  And the question is, is the US going to present what it's calling its final agreement proposal [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=398.44s)]
*  and then in some way distance itself? That seems unfathomable. Or are the US elections going to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  bring to a fore a new chapter in this? Or are we looking at another month of this kind of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=411.08s)]
*  really difficult wrenching process that's going on? And are other countries in the neighborhood [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=415.4s)]
*  going to do anything more? Again, most experts say, look, it's really about the US and the Israelis. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=420.28s)]
*  But there are other interlocutors. The Egyptians obviously have a keen stake in that border area. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=425.32s)]
*  Qatar has been the go-between with Hamas. And other Arab states, while they have still maintained a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=431.0s)]
*  relationship with Israel, have indicated mounting concern about what's happening too. So I would [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=436.04s)]
*  say I think we're looking at this continuing for still some more weeks, possibly up to the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=442.92s)]
*  one-year anniversary of these attacks, Carla. Incredible tragedy. And I do want to move on [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=447.24s)]
*  to the debate, in which I suspect Gaza will be a topic. But I had that image, an extraordinary [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=452.2s)]
*  image in Gaza this week in which fighting was paused for several days so the WHO could vaccinate [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=459.24s)]
*  tens of thousands of children against polio. And it is a reminder that people can stop fighting. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=465.24s)]
*  And children have suffered enormously in this war. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned that. I mean, that's, if not a ray of hope, it is a clear indication that [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  there are ways in which you can stop the fighting. These were phased cessations of activities to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=481.8s)]
*  allow health care workers a safe zone to come in, to allow people to come out, parents to bring their [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=487.08000000000004s)]
*  children out of hiding and shelter and to come out and get vaccinated. And apparently it was [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  very successful. You don't want on top of everything else a polio outbreak there. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=497.56s)]
*  And this is a part of the world where people live very close to each other. So it's of great [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=502.36s)]
*  concern to the Israeli public as well. So what you would say to yourself, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=505.8s)]
*  you'll vaccinate these children to stop them from getting polio and then start the bombing again? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=510.44s)]
*  This is just, the tragedy is enormous. Yeah. And the insanity of it is enormous. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=514.76s)]
*  Well, Bob, let's bring our conversation back to the US. Next Tuesday, ABC News will host a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=519.24s)]
*  presidential debate. So far, the only one that's scheduled between Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=525.8000000000001s)]
*  and former president Donald Trump in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After considerable [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=531.64s)]
*  huffing and puffing, both camps have ended up where they started and have accepted the same [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=537.0s)]
*  rules as the June CNN debate between president Biden and president Trump. No live audience, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=541.88s)]
*  muted mics when the other candidate is speaking. President Biden's disastrous performance last time [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=548.68s)]
*  around led him to pulling out of the race in favor of Harris. What are you going to be watching for [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=554.6s)]
*  this time around? Well, for starters, as with the previous debate, I'm not expecting much [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=559.8s)]
*  debating as in a thoughtful exchange over, let's say the merits of comprehensive US immigration [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=564.92s)]
*  reform or the rules-based international order and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=570.12s)]
*  For that, you have to come to this podcast. One would have to come to a sober think tank for that, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=575.0s)]
*  perhaps Carla, and this podcast. Yes. As we saw in the previous debate, we're going to be looking at [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  things like demeanor and temperament and speaking coherently in the moment, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=585.48s)]
*  as well as sprinkled in between any signs of sort of new positions. Former president Trump had a [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  recent appearance on Fox News where he signaled the types of things he's going to bring up, such as [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  candidate Harris's previous opposition to fracking. She had supported a ban on fracking. She's changed [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  that position on it. That's a big deal in a state like Pennsylvania, where a lot of jobs and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=605.0s)]
*  livelihoods are linked to fracking and the extraction of fossil fuels, among other things. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=609.8s)]
*  There is going to be a lot of talk about the border. Again, as former president Trump indicated, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=616.5999999999999s)]
*  he's going to link vice president Harris to border policies and what he says is the ruinous policy [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=622.28s)]
*  he charged in in the last debate against president Biden, referring to boards of mentally ill and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=627.9599999999999s)]
*  criminals and so forth coming across, streaming across the border. It's going to be interesting [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=634.52s)]
*  to see how vice president Harris handles that type of criticism, but also how she counters in [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=638.6s)]
*  terms of policies that Trump himself has supported and also where they agree. There's interestingly [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=643.4s)]
*  coming up as they are going into this debate as a potential administration move to block the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=648.52s)]
*  acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel, a Japanese firm, which supporters of the deal say would [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=654.52s)]
*  preserve thousands of jobs, which opponents such as both Trump and Harris say is something that [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  should not be allowed. This is something that's a bedrock US company that needs to continue [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=666.68s)]
*  to be wholly US owned. It's part of US infrastructure, economic infrastructure, let's say. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=671.64s)]
*  As will be argued before, the body that oversees such deals is a matter of national security. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=677.4799999999999s)]
*  How much will that kind of thing will come up in the debate? Not sure. You won't be hearing [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=683.88s)]
*  great expositions about the merits of free trade in this debate. It's going to be about [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=687.64s)]
*  protecting the American worker in various ways, Carlos. That's going to be interesting to note as [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=691.24s)]
*  well. There are sharp divisions on not only things like immigration, but Ukraine policy, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=695.56s)]
*  obviously. President Trump has repeatedly said he's going to bring it to an end. He can have [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=701.2399999999999s)]
*  one phone call and bring it to an end and so forth. Will Harris hold him to account for that and have [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=705.56s)]
*  him explain what that means? That would be interesting. She's very much been a staunch [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=709.8s)]
*  supporter of the Transatlantic Alliance and support for Ukraine as an important bulwark against [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=713.64s)]
*  autocracy, against violation of sovereignty, against Russian aggression. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=719.64s)]
*  Right. Again, how much will any of these types of things emerge as policy difference versus the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=723.4s)]
*  noise and the atmospherics, even without a live audience and with muted mics and so forth? How [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=729.0s)]
*  much are we going to get into any sort of exchange of ideas? That's going to be probably a lesser [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=735.0799999999999s)]
*  issue as we get into the atmospherics. Then of course, reproductive rights. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=740.6s)]
*  You get into reproductive rights and other issues involving health policy in terms of response to [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=745.4s)]
*  pandemics past and potentially future and so forth, really stark differences there between the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=750.92s)]
*  two candidates. Harris is definitely going to make a big deal about the reproductive rights and [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=755.88s)]
*  holding up Trump as a threat to that, which has seen Democrats had gained in the past in [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  polling on that issue. Even though Trump has been [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=764.8399999999999s)]
*  claiming he's going to be the right defender of reproductive rights and all of that. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=768.04s)]
*  In vitro fertilization. It's going to be very interesting to see how those responses are. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=771.4799999999999s)]
*  Again, a backdrop to all this Carla is incredibly close polling. Rays are thin, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=776.52s)]
*  especially looking at the swing states and the so-called blue wall states of Wisconsin, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=781.16s)]
*  Michigan, Pennsylvania, but also some of the southern states that have seen as crucial, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=786.12s)]
*  Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina now. Polling is just showing repeatedly very close. There's [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=790.6s)]
*  definitely wind in the Democrat sails with Kamala Harris's campaign coming on fully on board post [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=797.16s)]
*  convention. Trump has had to pivot obviously from what he was looking forward to, which was [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=803.0s)]
*  campaigning against Biden to this new phenomenon of a Harris campaign, but they are making and [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=807.64s)]
*  look poised to make a lot of arguments about tying her to what they see as failed economic [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=812.6s)]
*  policies that are hurting a lot of Americans. Polling is showing that seems to be effective [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=818.52s)]
*  to some extent. What do we know about her debate style? I went and looked back at the one debate [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=823.72s)]
*  she had against Vice President Pence last time around, and all I can remember is that fly on his [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=829.72s)]
*  incredibly white hair, but she did quite well in that, didn't she? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=837.72s)]
*  – She, by all accounts, had performed well in that debate. It is said to be a good format for her, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=840.68s)]
*  for her style. Speaking, she's not so much the flaming orator or being able to sort of weave [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=845.8s)]
*  eloquence like Barack Obama on the campaign hustings, but in debate type settings, and this [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=852.52s)]
*  is a former prosecutor we're talking about, she is said to be comfortable and effective. Trump's [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=857.64s)]
*  done more of these. This is, I think, number seven for him, and he was asked about preparations for [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=863.24s)]
*  it at his event on Fox the other night, and basically saying, well, you know, there's only [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  so much you can do. He's ready for it. He tends to dismiss the need to do super prep. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=871.64s)]
*  – At the same time, he's claiming that ABC is not going to be fair, so he's lowering expectations, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=876.12s)]
*  which is part of the game here. I mean, although more than lowering expectations, claiming it's [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=880.52s)]
*  not going to be fair, I think that one of the things I'm going to be watching as a journalist is [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=884.76s)]
*  whether or not the moderators are going to behave less like potted plants than the CNN moderators, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=889.4s)]
*  who I thought honestly failed because they didn't push the candidates. They let them say things that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=894.6s)]
*  were just not true and didn't force follow-ups. And the notion they had fact checking online, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=900.92s)]
*  I mean, nobody's paying any attention to the online fact checking. I think the moderators are [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=906.76s)]
*  not debating, but I think they have a responsibility to help shape the debate, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=910.92s)]
*  and we'll see what ABC does if they do a better job. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=914.76s)]
*  – Yeah, it would be good, and it's why I started out with a bit of a facetious [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=917.8s)]
*  comment about what the debate will yield. It would be good if they actually tried to, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=921.3199999999999s)]
*  you know, maintain a format that at least, you know, sought to tee up and require [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=925.16s)]
*  actual comments about issues as opposed to exchanging back and forth in ways that it might [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=930.76s)]
*  generate more heat than light. But, you know, I agree. I think it would be good to see that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=935.56s)]
*  We'll have to see, you know, what comes out of this and whether there's another debate, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=938.92s)]
*  whether the candidates think it's worthwhile having another debate, Carla. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=942.36s)]
*  – Carla, I want to cross over to Canada now, specifically Toronto. Some have likened to New [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=945.16s)]
*  York run by the Swiss, but they have a very well-known international film festival that [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=951.0799999999999s)]
*  kind of gets in between Cannes and Venice, and it has more of an indie vibe. There's said to be more [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=955.4s)]
*  sort of public attendance, and sometimes it gives an early peek at blockbusters too. Carla, I know [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=961.9599999999999s)]
*  you avidly follow films, both indies and the blockbusters. Can you say Meg La Don? So, Carla, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=967.16s)]
*  what should we be looking for at the Toronto Film Festival? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=973.7199999999999s)]
*  – The Meg, yes. The Meg is a big hit in my household, yes. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=975.56s)]
*  We're big Jason Statham fans, yes, okay. So a raft of big movies or small movies that have made it [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=979.24s)]
*  big have premiered at Toronto, and the list of some big ones that have come out, Pride and Prejudice, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=986.1999999999999s)]
*  Slumdog Millionaire, Black Swan, The King's Speech, Silver Linings Playbook, 12 Years a Slave, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=992.76s)]
*  La La Land, Itania, and Last Year American Fiction. – Oh, those are all significant, big and good. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=998.2s)]
*  – Yeah, some were small that made it big, some were always big, and they decided to roll it out [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1004.68s)]
*  in Toronto, so there's a lot to watch for there. Our fabulous researcher, Helen, came up with a [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1008.6s)]
*  great list, and I spent a lot of time looking at it. And some of them you can find trailers, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1014.12s)]
*  a lot of them you can't find trailers, so I'm just going to have to look at the description [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1018.2s)]
*  to try to figure out what intrigues me. So I could have done 20, but we don't have time for it, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1022.44s)]
*  so I'll just give you a few. I'm intrigued by something called The Brutalist, and this is a [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1026.3600000000001s)]
*  multilingual international co-production between the US, UK, and Hungary. And it's the story of [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1031.4s)]
*  an imaginary Hungarian Holocaust survivor, an architect named Laszlo Tóth, who's played by [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1036.92s)]
*  Adrian Brody, who emigrates to the US after the war, and he's working with a highly controlling [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1041.88s)]
*  patron played by Guy Pearce, who wants him to build a brutalist masterpiece in Pennsylvania. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1048.5200000000002s)]
*  Now, I'm not a big fan of brutalist architecture. We've got an enormous amount of it here in DC. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1054.7600000000002s)]
*  The Forrestal building, the Hirshhorn, HHS, some would say some of these things are pretty big [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1060.44s)]
*  eyesores. Other people would say that it is this height of modern Bauhaus architecture, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1066.44s)]
*  no embellishment, enormous amounts of concrete. Here he is, this Holocaust survivor with this [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1072.92s)]
*  uber-wasp patron, and they're going to build this concrete with some marble-like other masterpiece. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1078.76s)]
*  And I know it's not politically correct. I really love the Fountainhead movie, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1084.28s)]
*  and this sounds like it has a taste of this, an incredibly ambitious driven architect. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1090.92s)]
*  And it's directed by Brady Corbett, who also did Vox Lux, and it also stars Felicity Jones as Tóth's [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1096.6000000000001s)]
*  wife. She's a concentration camp survivor. And it's three hours and 15 minutes long, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  and it's going to be presented in 70 millimeter at the festival to reinforce that feeling of an epic. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1108.8400000000001s)]
*  But I'm in. I looked up the term brutalism. It's often attributed as emerging from the French word [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1113.64s)]
*  béton brut, meaning raw concrete. And I may not be all in for brutalism, but I'm certainly going [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1121.08s)]
*  to watch the movie. So another one that intrigues me is something called Conclave, and that's [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1127.8s)]
*  another international co-production. And this one is US-UK, and it's directed by Edward Berger, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1132.28s)]
*  the German who won the Oscar last year for best international feature film that we talked about [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1138.6s)]
*  for All Quiet on the Western Front, which I thought was an extraordinary movie. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1142.6s)]
*  It was a great movie. Great movie. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1146.12s)]
*  And for that alone, I'm willing to watch this, but it also has some- [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1146.76s)]
*  Spooky soundtrack too. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1150.6s)]
*  Yes, that was an extraordinary soundtrack. So this is the story of a political battle that unfolds [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1151.72s)]
*  over 72 hours. The College of Cardinals meets to elect a new pope. And the two leading candidates [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1156.04s)]
*  are one is a reactionary and openly racist cardinal, and another is a very progressive cardinal. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1162.28s)]
*  And it has, as I like to say, an all-star cast with Ray Fine, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1169.72s)]
*  and Isabella Rossellini. She is not up for the papacy, not surprisingly. But I think it says [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1175.0s)]
*  a lot about the state of politics within the church itself as well as an extraordinary cast. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1181.48s)]
*  So I'm intrigued by this. So that's the Conclave. And there is a Georgian movie, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1185.72s)]
*  which is more of your indie description here, and that tells the story. It's called April, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1192.6s)]
*  and it tells the story of an OBGYN living in rural town in the foothills of the Caucasus, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1196.68s)]
*  who not only delivers babies, she also secretly performs abortions for women who come to her [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1201.8799999999999s)]
*  desperate for care. And her work is investigated after a stillbirth happens on her watch. And [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1207.48s)]
*  there are also rumors of her abortion work that surface. And as she battles to defend her career, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1213.72s)]
*  she begins to question her own decisions. The doctor sounds both heroic, but also a textured [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1219.0s)]
*  character. And given the increasingly problematic politics of Georgia, I think it sounds like a [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1224.04s)]
*  movie that's really worth watching. The director, Dia, and I'm sure I'm going to mess up her name, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1229.8s)]
*  is Kulumbaghshvili, and the lead actress, Ia Sukhichavili, spend considerable time in a local [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1234.9199999999998s)]
*  maternity ward in the town where the story is set, which also happens to be the director's hometown. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1242.2s)]
*  And they even filmed in the clinic's courtyard. So it sounds like something that is very relevant [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1246.44s)]
*  for what's going on given the assault on reproductive rights in the United States, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1251.96s)]
*  as well as the assault on so many rights inside of Georgia. And finally, because we only have [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1255.56s)]
*  limited time, but here's one that really I'm definitely in for it. It's called All of You. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1261.48s)]
*  And I probably shouldn't fall for this, but I love rom-coms, although I'm not sure this one is a com. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1267.56s)]
*  And I really love Brett Goldstein, who both stars in and co-wrote the movie along with British [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1272.6799999999998s)]
*  director William Bridges. And you probably know Goldstein from Ted Lasso, which he starred in as [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1277.6399999999999s)]
*  Roy Kent, and he also co-wrote. As for this movie, the convention seems really predictable. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1282.92s)]
*  It's the near future, and Simon and Laura are best friends. She takes a test that is supposedly [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1288.1200000000001s)]
*  guaranteed to match you with your soulmate. She finds said soulmate, but Simon and Laura maybe [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1292.8400000000001s)]
*  really be the true match for each other, and life unfolds, and I gather timelines bend. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1297.72s)]
*  I'm ready to give it a chance, if only so I can do the Roy Kent chant, which I can't do on our podcast. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1303.48s)]
*  You can't give it a try. We will put these as we have before on our show notes page so that those [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1309.48s)]
*  listening and wondering, what did Carla talk about, will see the link to the movie and maybe [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1316.4399999999998s)]
*  even the trailer as the case may be. And if you haven't watched Shrinking, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1320.76s)]
*  which is another Brett Goldstein with Jason Segal and Harrison Ford, a TV series, it's also quite [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1324.6799999999998s)]
*  fabulous, but I'm a huge Brett Goldstein fan. If not only because he was a writer who then decided, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1331.8799999999999s)]
*  sent in his audition tape to the people he was working with on Ted Lasso and became, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1338.2s)]
*  did you have you watched Ted Lasso? I certainly know of the Ted Lasso phenomenon. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1343.72s)]
*  I have not watched a full episode of Ted Lasso yet. Roy Kent has an extraordinary potty mouth, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1347.72s)]
*  and he's an extraordinary character. He's quite wonderful. So I recommend that, and that's why [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1352.92s)]
*  I'm in for this movie as well. So effing Roy Kent, as I like to say. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1357.56s)]
*  Well, Carla, it's now time to hear from our audience, as in the audience figure of the week [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1363.32s)]
*  portion of the podcast. There's your ding that you love to wait for. This is the figure that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1367.72s)]
*  listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's Instagram story. Our audience [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1373.48s)]
*  this week selected US seizes Maduro's Air Force One. Carla, why is this significant? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1378.84s)]
*  I don't think it's going to change anything in Venezuela, but it's sort of a cold story. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1385.88s)]
*  So the justice department says the plane was purchased through a shell company for $13 million [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1389.88s)]
*  in violation of US trade sanctions, and they seized the plane because they needed to enforce [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1395.48s)]
*  US sanctions law. But the real issue here is their ongoing effort to find some lever, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1401.96s)]
*  any lever to change Maduro's behavior. And we've been doing this for a really long time and really [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1408.04s)]
*  failing to do it. The state department most recently recognized Maduro's challenger in the [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1414.9199999999998s)]
*  late July election Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner. Maduro, of course, has claimed to have won and his [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1420.6s)]
*  stacked election counsel and Supreme Court have ratified that claim. The plane looks really shiny. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1427.1599999999999s)]
*  The decision to seize it and make such a big deal out of it. Is it going to change Maduro's mind? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1433.7199999999998s)]
*  I doubt it. We've done a lot bigger things in the past. After the 2018 rig vote, the US and [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1438.52s)]
*  dozens of other countries recognize the president of Venezuela's National Assembly, opposition leader [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1444.1999999999998s)]
*  Juan Guaido as the country's president. Unfortunately, that changed nothing. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1449.16s)]
*  During the Trump administration, the justice department charged Maduro in a gaggle of his [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1453.4s)]
*  cronies with narco terrorism. That sadly changed nothing. The Biden administration tried a less [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1457.24s)]
*  confrontational approach with Maduro and lifted some sanctions before the election in hopes that [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1463.3200000000002s)]
*  Maduro might allow them to go forward. They also hoped it was going to stabilize oil prices. That [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1467.88s)]
*  may have actually worked. But what did Maduro do? He barred the number one opposition candidate from [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1473.96s)]
*  running and then stole the election from her chosen number two. Go ahead, seize my plane. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1480.52s)]
*  I think that's going to be Maduro's action to it and he'll probably just get another plane. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1487.0s)]
*  RICK Yeah. I mean, as you indicated, carrots, sticks, carotene sticks, none of this seems to [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1490.8400000000001s)]
*  have worked in regard to Venezuela under Maduro, who also, it must be said, continues to be [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1497.08s)]
*  underestimated in his ability to cling on to power, either through manipulating votes or [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1502.2s)]
*  consolidating the power centers of the country. Because again, we look at another recent example [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1507.88s)]
*  that wasn't the case in a place like Bangladesh, for example, which is still dealing with a [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1513.0s)]
*  transition of its own and it hadn't an autocratic leader there. And yet some have pulled out hope [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1517.48s)]
*  that you're going to see a more democratic Bangladesh emerge from difficulties there. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1522.6000000000001s)]
*  But Venezuela, not so much luck. And the latest chapter also includes some regional pressure [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1527.24s)]
*  that he's gotten, including from leftist governments. It doesn't seem to make any [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1532.92s)]
*  difference though. RENEE Well, he still has the military with him. And a huge number of people [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1536.04s)]
*  chose instead of staying and protesting, chose to leave. The country's in desperate economic [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1541.96s)]
*  shape, but he still has enough money to buy off the military and to buy off his supporters. And [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1546.44s)]
*  one of the... It would be wacky if it weren't so incredibly depressing. On Monday, Maduro announced [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1552.84s)]
*  that this year's Christmas holiday season would begin on October 1st. And I don't think anyone's [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1560.4399999999998s)]
*  going to be running out to buy tinsel, but the Chavista government traditionally ups its handouts [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1565.8799999999999s)]
*  of food and aid packages in the Christmas season. So Maduro is going to do that even earlier this [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1571.6399999999999s)]
*  year and start buying people off. So it already smells like Christmas, as he said in his speech. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1577.96s)]
*  And he's going to come January. He's planning on being inaugurated again. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1584.28s)]
*  PAUL Yeah. It's distressing and you try to hold out some sort of horizon for some change, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1588.8400000000001s)]
*  but it doesn't look like that's going to be possible unless there's some other unexpected [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1595.4s)]
*  element within Venezuela at this point. And that doesn't seem likely either. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1599.8s)]
*  RENEE So the plane has been moved from the Dominican Republic where it was seized, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1603.32s)]
*  and it's sitting here and Maduro is in power. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1606.84s)]
*  PAUL And that's our look at the world next week. Here are some other stories to keep an eye on. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWcSKxiIs70&t=1609.72s)]
