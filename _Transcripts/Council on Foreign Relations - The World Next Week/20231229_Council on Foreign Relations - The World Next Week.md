# The World Next Year Stories to Watch in 2024
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [December 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo)
*  Welcome to the World Next Week special year-end episode, The World Next Year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=7.12s)]
*  And I'm Carla Ann Robbins. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  And I'm Nahal Tusi. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=10.6s)]
*  Carla and Nahal, we've made it through another turbulent year, it seems. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=23.8s)]
*  2023 was filled with another set of unprecedented international events. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=27.8s)]
*  In this special episode, we're going to discuss some of the leading foreign policy challenges [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=32.32s)]
*  heading into the new year, 2024, but also take note of significant developments in the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=35.52s)]
*  current year that's wrapping up 2023. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=40.6s)]
*  Joining us for this special episode is Nahal Tusi. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=43.56s)]
*  Nahal is Politico's senior foreign affairs and national security correspondent. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=45.84s)]
*  And her reporting, which I enthusiastically recommend to all of you, has taken her all [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=49.92s)]
*  around the world from Pakistan to Myanmar to Germany. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  She's also a keen observer of Washington policymaking. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=57.04s)]
*  So Nahal, welcome to our show, and I'm so glad you're here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=60.16s)]
*  Nahal, it's a pleasure to have you join us. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=62.76s)]
*  Thanks Carla and Bob for having me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=65.16s)]
*  So Nahal, let's start with the Israel-Hamas War. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=67.88s)]
*  A few months ago, the world and the White House's attention was focused mainly on Ukraine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=70.56s)]
*  And now the horrors of this new war are dominating the news and further polarizing societies, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=75.64s)]
*  including our own. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=80.28s)]
*  Why were Tel Aviv and Washington so unprepared for the October 7th attacks that set this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=81.28s)]
*  off? And do you see any hope of a settlement of this anytime soon? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=86.44s)]
*  Well, to say this is a challenging foreign policy issue is an understatement, but let's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=91.48s)]
*  touch the basics first. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=95.92s)]
*  The Hamas militant group carried out a vicious attack on Israel on October 7th that killed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  some 1200 people while taking more than 200 hostages. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel has responded with a heavy handed air and ground military campaign that has displaced [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=105.44s)]
*  more than 1.5 million of the 2.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and killed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=110.56s)]
*  thousands of them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  This is the latest iteration of the modern version of this conflict that goes back decades, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  including the sparking of a war resulting from Israel's creation and the mass displacement [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=122.68s)]
*  of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=127.4s)]
*  So there are so many factors that feed into what has happened. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=129.84s)]
*  Everything from Hamas's refusal to accept the Israeli state to Israel's apparent [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  blindness to Hamas's growing capabilities. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=138.56s)]
*  There's militancy on the Palestinian side, of course, but there's also growing extremism [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=141.76s)]
*  among Israeli settlers who are taking more and more space in land claimed by Palestinians [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=146.04s)]
*  for a future state. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=150.92s)]
*  There's Iran's role in fostering Hamas and there's the misguided belief by many [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=152.32s)]
*  Israelis that they could merely manage the Palestinian issue without solving the core [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=157.48s)]
*  problem, that there are millions of Palestinians living in difficult conditions without [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=161.72s)]
*  hope for a real future. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=166.0s)]
*  So it's strange to say it, but to solve this crisis, you have to solve this crisis. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=167.6s)]
*  You have to figure out a way to help Palestinians achieve their aspirations while [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=172.92s)]
*  keeping Israelis feeling secure. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=176.92s)]
*  Above all, I think it's fair to question the leadership on all sides. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=179.2s)]
*  It's hard to look at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's tenure without [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  concluding he's undermined the so-called peace process. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=188.48s)]
*  It's hard to look at the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas's record and give him many [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=191.92s)]
*  points. Then you have Hamas, which has really lived up to its terrorist designation and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=196.56s)]
*  may have doomed any Israeli-Palestinian peace effort for generations. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=202.12s)]
*  Or if you have smart and strong enough leaders, they might seize this crisis as an [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=207.6s)]
*  opportunity to find a path to resolve this conflict. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  But U.S. leadership has never been strong enough to resolve this conflict. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  And when President Biden took office, he and his aides very deliberately downplayed it [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  and made clear that they had no real interest in solving the problem because they didn't think [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=227.52s)]
*  either side was willing to do so. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=232.08s)]
*  Instead, they focused on helping Israel build relations with Arab countries. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=234.68s)]
*  But it was like trying to build a Jenga tower, but having the bottom layer be just one [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=238.8s)]
*  piece. Now the United States is trying to pick up the pieces, but it can barely get Israel to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=242.96s)]
*  listen to its pleas to limit civilian casualties, much less get Hamas to listen to anything. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=247.76s)]
*  A popular phrase you hear a lot these days from U.S. officials and think tankers is that the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=253.8s)]
*  Palestinians deserve to have a political horizon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=258.88s)]
*  I get the point of the phrase. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=262.28s)]
*  You want them to have hope. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=264.0s)]
*  But I have to admit, I think it's kind of a dumb phrase. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=265.8s)]
*  After all, a horizon is something you can never really reach. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=269.44s)]
*  I think it's too nice to say that Netanyahu just undermined the peace process. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=273.44s)]
*  And I think this is a big focus here because hope, you know, possibility, opportunity here [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=280.0s)]
*  is there's no political leadership. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  So do you see possibility when the fighting ends or at least comes down to a dull roar that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=288.72s)]
*  there might be a significant political change inside of Israel, that there might be the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  possibility of a revamp of Palestinian authority, or are we just going to limp along this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=300.0s)]
*  way indefinitely? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  That's such a hard question to answer, because at first, when you look at the polls, when you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=307.32s)]
*  look at the immediate reaction from Israelis themselves, when you look at the run up to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  October 7th with the political crisis in Israel involving attempts by Netanyahu and his [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=318.84s)]
*  right-wing coalition to overhaul the judiciary, there was a strong desire by many Israelis [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  to see Netanyahu go away. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  My sense from the US and others is that there is a belief that he's not long for this [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  political world in terms of his leadership, that he has to basically step aside because this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=338.44s)]
*  has been such a massive failure on his part. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=343.8s)]
*  And he has yet to take responsibility. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  And people are really, really frustrated by that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  But there's a couple of things to bear in mind. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=351.36s)]
*  One is the question of how long this war is going to take. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=353.68s)]
*  And to be really frank, the longer it takes, he in some ways can stay ensconced. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  He might be able to convince enough Israelis that it's not a good idea to, what's the saying, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=364.92s)]
*  change a horse in midstream, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=371.2s)]
*  It's, I don't want to say it's politically incentivized for him to make the war drag out. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=373.28s)]
*  But I know that there are some people who who believe that that he has that incentive. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Then there's the question of who would replace him and what mechanism would get him out? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=384.84s)]
*  Like, would Likud his party kick him out? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=389.64s)]
*  Would his coalition partners drop him? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  Would there have to be another election in Israel? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=396.44s)]
*  How would they carry that out given the ongoing crisis? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=398.96s)]
*  It's something I think a lot of people want to see. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=403.28s)]
*  Goodbye, Bibi, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=405.56s)]
*  But technically, it's not as simple as one might think. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=406.84s)]
*  And in terms of you're asking about the Palestinian Authority, I yeah, there's definitely the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=411.8s)]
*  planning inside the US government for a post, you know, kind of a day after in Gaza is that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=419.28s)]
*  there will be an interim situation where you'll hopefully have some sort of international [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=425.76s)]
*  force come in and try to stabilize the place while they can. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=429.96s)]
*  They use the word revitalize the Palestinian Authority. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=434.52s)]
*  What they really mean is like completely restructure reform, rebuild it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=437.64s)]
*  A lot of words starting with Ari. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=442.08s)]
*  And I think the belief is that Mahmoud Abbas has to go and that you have to bring in completely [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  new people. One of the concerns about that, though, is in theory, you would need people [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=451.32s)]
*  from Gaza to step up. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=456.76s)]
*  Who are these people? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=459.12s)]
*  Where are these people? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=460.24s)]
*  Do they still have houses? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=461.84s)]
*  It's not a simple thing. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  And then there's the question of how destroyed will Hamas be? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=465.6s)]
*  Right. So you can get rid of a lot of Hamas's structures or even a lot of its arsenal. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=470.0s)]
*  But if you can't fully get rid of the force in terms of security, much less politically, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=477.12s)]
*  there's always going to be this danger. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  So if you have even if you have like, you know, 20 percent of Hamas's fighters left and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  they have enough weapons, that is a lot of people causing a lot of havoc in Gaza. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  And then that stretches this question of whatever interim means when it comes to this [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=496.16s)]
*  international force. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=501.56s)]
*  And if I had to predict what will happen, it's that Israel and its troops will be in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=503.04s)]
*  Gaza a lot longer than they say they like to be. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  We should note as we're taping this year end podcast, there are new stirrings on the other [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=510.8s)]
*  front between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=515.96s)]
*  And there's a great deal of concern about not only the ongoing campaign in Gaza and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=518.0400000000001s)]
*  what that means in terms of humanitarian and also backlash, but also does another front [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=523.08s)]
*  open up? Are you seeing any sense that there is a will, a regional, international will [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  to try to contain this in the holidays? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  Is this something we should be watching as the year comes to an end? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=535.4s)]
*  There's definitely an international desire among the U.S. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  and others to prevent this from spreading further. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=541.2800000000001s)]
*  And there has been a sense that Iran wants to cause trouble via Hezbollah for Israel, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=544.92s)]
*  but not to spark an all out war on that front. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=550.92s)]
*  The tough talk right now is coming from the Israelis. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=554.88s)]
*  And so you almost get the sense that maybe they're just doing it almost as a deterrent to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=558.12s)]
*  try to calm things down as opposed to escalate things. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=562.68s)]
*  So, Bob, let's move on to more optimistic issues. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=566.3599999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=571.92s)]
*  This past year, we've seen a major shift to green energy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=572.36s)]
*  The United States has been working hard to catch up with Europe in energy transition. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=576.08s)]
*  Investment in renewable energy has skyrocketed with $358 billion of global investment [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=579.72s)]
*  during the first half of the year. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=586.12s)]
*  With 2023 set to be the hottest year on record, there's been global momentum to stop warming [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=588.04s)]
*  before it passes dangerous tipping points. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=593.24s)]
*  Were efforts successful enough that we are on track for a greener power grid in 2024? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm going to answer this a little bit on one hand, on the other hand, and I should also [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=600.68s)]
*  again mention that the timing of our taping, the COP meeting, staying in the Middle East, the COP [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=605.0s)]
*  meeting that's wrapping up in Dubai is looking like it's going to go for some sort of watered [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=610.52s)]
*  down consensus document with struggles over the word could, as in the world could phase out fossil [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=615.0s)]
*  fuels in some indeterminate time period. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=622.4399999999999s)]
*  But there's a great deal of resistance to putting in any sort of a new energy transition [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=626.12s)]
*  in any sort of pledge, especially by oil rich nations to pledge to draw down fossil fuels. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=630.36s)]
*  But there are more than 100 nations that want to do so. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=636.52s)]
*  So what you're going to see is a document that has all sorts of aspirations to expanding the amount [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=639.16s)]
*  and the commitment towards renewables. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=645.16s)]
*  We already saw a pledge by 118 governments to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=647.4s)]
*  And so there's sentiments like that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=653.72s)]
*  There's sentiments that we should be moving away from fossil fuels. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=655.88s)]
*  It's seeing the position of countries like the host country. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=659.0s)]
*  It's a little bit reminiscent of the famous quote attributed to St. Augustine, Lord grant me [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=661.88s)]
*  chastity and continence, but not just yet. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=667.0s)]
*  So not ready yet to commit to this. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=669.8s)]
*  But when we look to 2023 as a tipping point year, no, we'll look to it as a year in which some other [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=672.12s)]
*  significant things happened. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  There's some specific things that were kind of interesting to note. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=678.68s)]
*  The first ever commercial airliner to cross the Atlantic on purely low emissions fuel or, as he [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=681.8s)]
*  said, high fat fuel took place. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=686.6s)]
*  It was a Virgin Atlantic flight that was powered by using so-called sustainable aviation fuel made [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  up of waste fats. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=693.5600000000001s)]
*  We saw a country with high amounts of fossil fuels, Ecuador, vote in a referendum to ban oil drilling [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=695.0s)]
*  in part of its Amazon rainforest. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=701.0s)]
*  This is the first time in history a country's citizens voted to halt oil production. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=702.36s)]
*  Small country. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=706.84s)]
*  There's a lot of other fossil fuel production going on, especially in the United States, which [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=708.0400000000001s)]
*  has otherwise been a champion of renewables. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=711.64s)]
*  And so we also see predictions of fossil fuel production continuing to go on an upward [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=714.68s)]
*  trajectory even as renewables gain more investment. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=720.5999999999999s)]
*  So you cited an investment figure. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=723.4s)]
*  It's estimated that renewables are going to need to have something like $5 trillion in annual [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=725.4s)]
*  investments to really make a dent in getting into this closer, what they call deep [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=730.8399999999999s)]
*  decarbonization mode. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=735.3199999999999s)]
*  About a third of the world is now powered by renewables. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  That figure will inch up a little bit by 2030. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  But it's nowhere near what it needs to be to make that goal of limiting the global warming [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=743.48s)]
*  to 1.5 degrees Celsius pre-industrial levels. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=749.08s)]
*  And we're very close to that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=753.08s)]
*  Some parts of the world have already surpassed that according to measurements that we've seen [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=754.44s)]
*  coming out the last couple of weeks from meteorological organizations. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  And what that means, as we have already seen, is extreme weather incidents of irregularity. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=761.08s)]
*  And so that is certainly a backdrop to what happened in the COP talks. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  Island nations are in the forefront of concern, but many other nations also raising alarm. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=771.56s)]
*  And so these COP meetings will continue to happen. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=776.1999999999999s)]
*  But there's a real question about whether the changes will happen quickly enough. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=778.8399999999999s)]
*  One other thing I should mention, because it is cited by those who see the glasses half full. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=782.28s)]
*  A few years ago, I think three years ago, it was one out of every 20 or so vehicles that was [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=786.68s)]
*  purchased was an electric vehicle. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=791.7199999999999s)]
*  In I think three years time, it's one out of every five. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=793.56s)]
*  And you have seen a real ramp up in the technology and the mining for the technology [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=796.68s)]
*  that's used to power electric vehicles. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=802.2s)]
*  And the United States and now Europe increasingly are pledging and are committing to [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=804.28s)]
*  investing in those on their home turf to ward off against China completely dominating the market. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=809.32s)]
*  So you will see electric vehicles increase. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=815.08s)]
*  But as anybody who's driven around this country, especially in the recent Thanksgiving break, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=817.16s)]
*  knows, the amount of infrastructure needed for EVs isn't anywhere close to what it needs to be, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=820.76s)]
*  just in a country like the United States. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=825.72s)]
*  RISA GOLUBOFF So if I am Micronesia, how should I feel about all this? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=827.1600000000001s)]
*  MICHAEL MCGEE You should feel frustrated and worried. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=831.1600000000001s)]
*  And you should be doubling down on what's known as adaptation mode, which is going for increased [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=834.52s)]
*  funding for survivability. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=842.0400000000001s)]
*  And this gets to something that was announced at the very outset of COP, which was this loss [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=844.0400000000001s)]
*  and damage fund that countries are going to commit to. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=847.4s)]
*  This was an achievement of the previous year's COP, the commitment to create such a fund. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=850.12s)]
*  It's in the hundreds of millions. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=854.0400000000001s)]
*  It's got to get well into the billions to be meaningful. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=855.1600000000001s)]
*  And so island nations are going to need to look seriously at whether they need to, first of all, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  move their population centers from any low-lying areas or just sort of depopulate most of their [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=863.1600000000001s)]
*  nations, which is the case that some places actually have sort of relocation plans already [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=867.72s)]
*  in the works. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=872.12s)]
*  It's that serious for them. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=873.0s)]
*  They, again, are on the front lines of the rising sea levels. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=874.84s)]
*  And as we look at the footage and see the reports of calving glaciers from Antarctica or [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=878.44s)]
*  Greenland's ice melt and so forth, this is the result of that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's only going to continue. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=888.6s)]
*  And by the way, it's going to continue even if we had an incredible surge in renewables and sort [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=890.5200000000001s)]
*  of tripled the pace at which countries are adopting renewable only. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=895.4000000000001s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK So Bob, one of the big questions here is the word unabated and whether or not [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=898.9200000000001s)]
*  we're going to phase out unabated coal-fired power plants and this question of carbon capture [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=903.32s)]
*  solutions. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=909.5600000000001s)]
*  Why is it that some environmentalists are against this idea of coal-fired plants in which you can [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=911.08s)]
*  still capture the carbon? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=916.7600000000001s)]
*  Why isn't that a good solution? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=918.36s)]
*  It would seem to me that solving this problem is going to need lots of different technologies. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=920.44s)]
*  BOB Yeah, and I think you get to a good point. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=924.0400000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=926.5200000000001s)]
*  Some environments do. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=926.84s)]
*  They see it as a way out, a get-out-of-jail-free card, so to speak, for some of the oil [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=927.8000000000001s)]
*  companies that have been ratcheting up their production and have been lobbying against any [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=932.12s)]
*  sort of move to renewables. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=936.6s)]
*  And so now they see them kind of trying to jump in and have their cake and eat it too. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=938.52s)]
*  And they just sort of see it as a sop. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=942.12s)]
*  We've heard the term greenwashing all around this COP meeting and prior to this. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=943.8s)]
*  But the fact remains that a lot of energy experts on many sides, those who continue to see fossil [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=949.4s)]

*  If it's a roulette wheel and you're trying to put your numbers down, as many numbers as possible [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=963.0799999999999s)]

*  There was an interesting line in the recent year-end edition of The Economist, which said, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=969.4s)]
*  The energy superpowers of the transition will be those that ignore critics and do everything, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=973.24s)]
*  flog fossil fuels, dig out metals and turbocharge renewables. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=977.56s)]
*  No country does all that yet. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=981.4s)]
*  The transition's biggest prizes are still to play for. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=982.76s)]
*  No country does all that yet, but there are some countries that are doing a lot of these things, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=985.88s)]
*  including the United States and China. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=988.92s)]
*  China is heavily into renewables. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=990.5999999999999s)]
*  They dominate the solar panel market and they're doing a lot on solar. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=992.36s)]
*  They're doing a lot on wind. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=996.5999999999999s)]
*  The US is trying to do all those as well. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=998.04s)]
*  China, by the way, also has still heavy use of coal-fired power stations, but [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1001.0799999999999s)]
*  their move away from fossil fuel reliance is one of the things that has given a little bit of hope [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1005.88s)]
*  that the world might be able to ratchet up its transition to green or clean energy, as it were. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1011.16s)]
*  To your point, Carla, I think it's a question of doing as many things as possible [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1017.1600000000001s)]
*  and then also looking for the unexpected technology. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1021.1600000000001s)]
*  I still recall in the not too distant past with the fracking phenomenon that was a real [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1023.4s)]
*  revolution for US energy industry. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1028.1200000000001s)]
*  The initial reports on fracking, it was seen as, pardon the expression, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1030.8400000000001s)]
*  pipe dream in terms of the volume of energy you could untap. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1034.2s)]
*  And yet it became the salvation in a way for domestic US energy industry. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1037.24s)]
*  Some people are thinking about, actually they're doing more than thinking. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1042.44s)]
*  They're using investment to try to tap some of the fracking technology to tap into geothermal [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1045.64s)]
*  energy, which the US has some, maybe not on the level of a place like Iceland, but geothermal [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1050.6000000000001s)]
*  is seen as another area of opportunity for power. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1055.16s)]
*  And hydrogen is seen as a tantalizing source as well. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1058.2s)]
*  I think there's still work to be done there to get it up to scale, according to some of the reports, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1061.24s)]
*  but there are others who are extremely bullish on hydrogen. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1066.1200000000001s)]
*  Nuclear has not gone away. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1069.48s)]
*  It's still in the US, for example, 20% of US energy comes from nuclear power and a lot more [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1070.68s)]
*  in a place like France also has its adherence. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1075.24s)]
*  And so we might see a bit more on the nuclear front, but I'm going to move on from the power [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1077.88s)]
*  games Carla and get us back to geopolitical power games as it were. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1081.56s)]
*  Let's go talk about Ukraine. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1085.48s)]
*  Again, as we're taping this podcast, Ukrainian president is in the United States, appealing [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1087.24s)]
*  for US aid at a particularly fraught moment. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1091.24s)]
*  And it's been almost a year and three quarters or so since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1094.2s)]
*  As we've talked about repeatedly on our podcast, Carla, it's at a stalemate. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1098.92s)]
*  Ukraine is in a tough position. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1103.24s)]
*  It needs more help from the US and needs more help from Europeans. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1105.16s)]
*  And Russia seems like it's willing to kind of stick it out for as long as it takes. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1108.2s)]
*  So the question is, looking back, what progress has Ukraine made during 2023 on the Russian front? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1111.64s)]
*  This has been a really difficult year for Ukraine, militarily, diplomatically, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1118.28s)]
*  politically at home. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1122.84s)]
*  The spring, much heralded spring into summer counteroffensive was supposed to sever the land [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1124.36s)]
*  bridge between occupied Crimea and Russia. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1129.0s)]
*  Since June, Ukrainian forces have advanced only about 10 miles. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1131.88s)]
*  The Russians were too deeply dug in. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1135.48s)]
*  The ground was carpeted in landmines. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1137.3200000000002s)]
*  And there was technology that no one expected that these drones could basically target troops [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1139.16s)]
*  wherever they showed up. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1144.68s)]
*  This is a new form of warfare. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1145.5600000000002s)]
*  And as weak as the Russians' troops were, they turned out to be too strong to take on, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1147.3200000000002s)]
*  particularly in breaking these really tough lines. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1151.16s)]
*  The Ukrainians were successful in attacking the Russian Black Sea fleet, forcing part of the [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1155.48s)]
*  fleet to move out of Sevastopol, but not enough to show that they could change the balance of the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1159.48s)]
*  war. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1164.2s)]
*  And momentum is all when it comes to wars. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1165.0s)]
*  Their tensions are reportedly rising between Zelensky, who's still playing the role of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1167.4s)]
*  cheerleader-in-chief and his top military commander. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1172.1200000000001s)]
*  Zelensky still has very high popularity, but some of it is beginning to fray. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1175.24s)]
*  And most important, as you noted, Ukraine's backers in the U.S. and Europe seem to be losing [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1179.96s)]
*  their enthusiasm for the fight. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1184.3600000000001s)]
*  So you're taping this without knowing whether the U.S. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1186.28s)]
*  Congress will approve another 60 billion plus in aid or how much more the EU is going to [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1188.76s)]
*  kick in. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1194.44s)]
*  There is no question at this point that Putin's strategy is to hold on through the November [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1195.8s)]
*  24 U.S. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1199.88s)]
*  election. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1200.76s)]
*  And he's betting that a Trump presidency will mean a complete U.S. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1201.24s)]
*  and NATO abandonment and a defeat for Kiev. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  Karla, I guess my question on Ukraine then is, can we start calling it a frozen conflict or is it [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1207.56s)]
*  still too soon for that? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1214.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, the frightening thing is that it may not be a frozen conflict. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1216.2s)]
*  It may be a conflict that Russia, if we back away, could win. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1219.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, for now, Russia is building up its resources. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1222.76s)]
*  It's contracting for more drones from Iran, getting artillery shells from North Korea. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1225.32s)]
*  It's calling up more troops. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1229.88s)]
*  The sanctions are in place. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1231.96s)]
*  There's still this oil price cap, which has lowered the price of Russian oil. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1233.56s)]
*  But the euro's crude is actually over 60 right now. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1237.24s)]
*  It's around 64. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1240.68s)]
*  And they are getting stuff from the Chinese. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1242.44s)]
*  They're getting stuff through Turkey. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1244.44s)]
*  And Putin doesn't seem to mind killing thousands and thousands of his own people. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1245.8s)]
*  And so, frozen might be the best thing you could hope for in the near term. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1251.1599999999999s)]
*  The Americans are now counseling the Ukrainians quietly. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1256.36s)]
*  2024 should be a year in which you build up your defenses. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1259.8799999999999s)]
*  We build up our ability to supply you because we are drawing low on munitions. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1264.68s)]
*  Ukrainians are building their own defense production capabilities. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1269.0s)]
*  But basically, don't expect to gain back more territory in 2024. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1273.16s)]
*  And the Ukrainians don't like that idea. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1278.52s)]
*  And that's under the best of circumstances if we can continue to provide aid for them. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1280.76s)]
*  So 2024 is supposed to be the year of rebuilding. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1284.92s)]
*  And then let's think about 2025. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1287.24s)]
*  The frozen conflict scenario also makes me think of something that has come up over the last year [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1289.96s)]
*  and a half, year and three quarters from various quarters. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1296.2s)]
*  It's been floated by the Russian side. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1299.48s)]
*  It's been floated by some in Western circles, which is Ukraine needs to get real and think about [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1300.84s)]
*  an off-ramp that includes Russia being allowed to possess some annexed area. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1306.12s)]
*  I don't know if it's up to 20% of Ukraine, but some sort of formula that says, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1311.08s)]
*  hey, we want Crimea back, but for the purpose of peace and to end this thing, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1314.84s)]
*  we should maybe sue for a peace deal. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1319.48s)]
*  It's extremely unpopular, but maybe it's less unpopular if we're looking at a situation [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1321.24s)]
*  which Ukraine is running out of sources for proper defense, as well as the morale and the [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1325.88s)]
*  public support that it has enjoyed. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1331.5600000000002s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Except I think Putin right now is when you see he is building up his forces and his [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1333.16s)]
*  military stocks, I think he's licking his chops and thinking he wants more than 20%. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  I think he's betting when he first launched this attack, which is that the Americans have, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1342.1200000000001s)]
*  in all democracies, have limited attention spans and that he's going to be able to [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1347.96s)]
*  break the West and break Ukraine. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1352.68s)]
*  I don't think he's going to negotiate anytime soon, and he's waiting to see what happens in [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1354.68s)]
*  the 2024 elections. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1358.68s)]
*  The really frightening thing is that he may not have to wait until 2024. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1360.2s)]
*  Republican-controlled Congress may be able to deliver what he wants even before then. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1364.44s)]
*  But it is unimaginable to me that we could walk away and hand Ukraine to the Russians, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1369.16s)]
*  but that's the unimaginable that we're staring right now. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1374.44s)]
*  Now, will the Ukrainians stop fighting? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1377.08s)]
*  I don't think they're going to stop fighting. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1378.6s)]
*  But Nahal's question and your question, I don't think this is a frozen conflict. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1380.36s)]
*  I think Ukraine is teetering on the brink. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1383.88s)]
*  So Nahal, throughout 2023, migration from Ukraine and lots of other places is a major [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1385.88s)]
*  concern for many governments, from crossings in the dangerous Daryan Gap, mass exodus of Afghan [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1391.64s)]
*  refugees. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1397.64s)]
*  People are moving at a rapidly growing rate, driven by climate, war, lots of other reasons. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1398.6000000000001s)]
*  Is migration going to be as intense in 2024 as it's been in 2023? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1404.8400000000001s)]
*  And is it going to be as disruptive politically as we'd seen it? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1409.48s)]
*  Well, I don't know if anyone in Washington has ever been held accountable for incorrectly [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1414.6s)]
*  predicting anything. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1418.28s)]
*  So here goes. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1419.56s)]
*  Yes, I believe the migration crisis is only going to grow in the coming year. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1420.9199999999998s)]
*  The factors that are driving much of the migration crisis aren't changing. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1424.84s)]
*  And in some cases are getting worse. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1429.3999999999999s)]
*  Gang violence in Latin America is spreading. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1431.1599999999999s)]
*  A country like Ecuador used to be relatively safe. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1433.32s)]
*  It's not as safe anymore. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1436.2s)]
*  Political instability remains a concern. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1437.8799999999999s)]
*  Everyone should look at what's going on in Nicaragua right now. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1440.76s)]
*  Let's not forget that migrants from countries well beyond Latin America are showing up at [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1443.96s)]
*  the US southern border. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1448.52s)]
*  Even Chinese trying to get away from their increasingly authoritarian government. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1450.28s)]
*  Then there's just the economic pull of the United States. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1454.6s)]
*  And this is what really gets me. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1458.04s)]
*  Due to climate change, there are growing spots on this planet that are simply not livable. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1460.04s)]
*  People have to move and the world hasn't truly reckoned with this. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1465.72s)]
*  We're already hearing a great deal about the migration crisis on the 2024 campaign trail. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1469.48s)]
*  Even Democrats are increasingly frustrated and want stronger border controls. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1474.44s)]
*  But here's the sense I get from talking to diplomats and other observers of the United States. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1478.84s)]
*  Republicans, and maybe to some extent Democrats, but it's mainly Republicans, have no political [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1483.24s)]
*  incentive to actually solve this migration crisis. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1488.3600000000001s)]
*  There are plenty of proposals that could help ease the problem. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1491.48s)]
*  And many of them are contained in the various comprehensive immigration reform ideas that [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1494.3600000000001s)]
*  have been put forth over the years. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1498.44s)]
*  But immigration also is a topic that drives voters, especially those in the GOP base. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1500.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a rallying cry. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1505.24s)]
*  If lawmakers were to actually pass measures to fix the system, they'd A, have less of [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1506.52s)]
*  a problem to yell about on the campaign trail and B, could get blamed by primary challengers [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1511.3200000000002s)]
*  or conservative media, for instance, if there are still any problems that remain, which [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1516.44s)]
*  there will be because that's life and that's reality. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1520.8400000000001s)]
*  So what is the political incentive to solve this problem? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1523.88s)]
*  You would think that the U.S. national interests would trump everything else, but in our polarized [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1526.76s)]
*  politics, maybe I'm too much of a cynic these days. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1531.8s)]
*  Nahal, do you think that there is, looking at what you mentioned, the comprehensive reform [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1535.96s)]
*  package, there are elements of it that could be walked through amidst all the noise. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1540.6s)]
*  Maybe you get some sort of group from both parties. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1545.96s)]
*  In the past, they called them wise men or whatever because there was only men. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1549.32s)]
*  But some sort of group of, let's say, centrist or people who are trying to get things done, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1552.76s)]
*  who say, let's create some new rules regarding temporary workers, for example. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1557.32s)]
*  That seems to be an area that gets looked past, but in fact, the U.S. has benefited from the [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1562.12s)]
*  availability of cheap labor for decades now. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1567.16s)]
*  And a lot of it has come from illegal immigrants or immigrants whose status changed over the [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1569.32s)]
*  course of time for various reasons. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1573.64s)]
*  But some sort of policy like that, in addition to, maybe it could be wrapped in with some [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1575.4s)]
*  extra border security or whatever that can work. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1580.92s)]
*  Or is it just something we're going to have to wait until the 2024 elections before we [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1583.64s)]
*  can really move forward? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1586.92s)]
*  I think that ahead of the election, the possibility of anything like piecemeal getting through [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1588.1200000000001s)]
*  is basically only if it's something that tightens immigration controls. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1593.96s)]
*  I don't think you're going to see any moderates or whatever opening up to the idea of allowing [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1598.6000000000001s)]
*  in anyone additionally. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1604.92s)]
*  In fact, what you're likely to see is more limits on asylum controls, border security, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1606.44s)]
*  of course, anything that just makes it harder to get in. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1611.56s)]
*  When Biden first took office, he actually didn't want to raise the refugee cap to what [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1616.04s)]
*  it used to be or above to make up for what Trump did in terms of decimating the refugee [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1623.3200000000002s)]
*  program because it was politically difficult. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1628.76s)]
*  And this is Biden, right? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1631.56s)]
*  By the way, before Trump, it was a bipartisan thing that was a very high level, the highest [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1633.3200000000002s)]
*  in the world, I think, like 75,000. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1637.64s)]
*  The refugee program before Trump used to have solid bipartisan support, but that's also [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1639.48s)]
*  fallen victim to our partisan politics. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1643.4s)]
*  But even Biden is aware of the politics. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1646.52s)]
*  He's more aware of it than many of his aides are. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1649.3200000000002s)]
*  I think if anything gets through at all, it's going to be something to restrict. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1653.24s)]
*  But I will also say, nothing can seem to get through on its own anymore. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1657.16s)]
*  Everything seems to be attached to something else. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1661.24s)]
*  One of the complaints I'm hearing a lot about these days from other observers of our country [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1663.08s)]
*  is why are you tying border security to Ukraine? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1667.7199999999998s)]
*  Why are you tying what they see as a domestic political issue to this international issue? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1671.08s)]
*  And that makes it even harder to get things through. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1676.28s)]
*  You would think that it would actually bring people together and think, OK, well, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1678.28s)]
*  I can compromise. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1682.6s)]
*  But compromise is a dirty word nowadays in Washington, right? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1683.32s)]
*  At least for some more than others. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1686.4399999999998s)]
*  So no, I don't see this happening prior to 2024. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1689.32s)]
*  I don't know if it's ever going to happen. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1692.36s)]
*  Although, I mean, we see this everywhere. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1694.52s)]
*  Macron had an immigration bill thrown out of Parliament. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1696.36s)]
*  Sunak's having a terrible problem with his proposal to, gosh, it sounds so grotesque, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1699.3999999999999s)]
*  move migrants to Rwanda. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1705.8s)]
*  But at the same time, you look at a place like Colombia and you had a guy like Duque [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1707.8799999999999s)]
*  who campaigned fiercely against the other, against migrants. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1712.76s)]
*  And then with this collapse in Venezuela, they took in hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1717.32s)]
*  And Duque absolutely blew me away with that in Colombia. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1723.3999999999999s)]
*  He did a complete 180 and the Colombian people followed. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1726.84s)]
*  Why do you think we're not seeing any leadership on this? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1731.08s)]
*  I mean, I think in the United States, it's again about winning elections, right? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1735.56s)]
*  So you kind of want to appeal to the extremes. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1740.9199999999998s)]
*  And for the GOP, the base is increasingly anti-immigrant. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1744.36s)]
*  It's an issue that just drives them. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1750.28s)]
*  And when you have a situation where we're so gerrymandered and redistricted in a way [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1751.9599999999998s)]
*  that you're not going to get challenged by someone who's more moderate than you, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1757.4799999999998s)]
*  you're going to get challenged by someone who's more extreme, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1761.4799999999998s)]
*  then you don't have a political incentive to find solutions to problems. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1764.52s)]
*  You have incentives actually to somehow create problems or make sure problems continue to exist [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1770.04s)]
*  so that you can yell about something and get people to show up and vote for you. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1775.48s)]
*  Internationally, I find some of this very interesting. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1780.2s)]
*  I mean, there are countries with major demographic declines, right? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1783.48s)]
*  Who need people whose governments are going around saying, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1787.96s)]
*  please, women, get married, have babies. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1791.24s)]
*  We need you to have babies. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1793.72s)]
*  And like Japan, for instance. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1795.1599999999999s)]
*  And yet, it's like, you know, there's a pretty easy solution to this population crisis. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1797.56s)]
*  You could just let in more immigrants, right? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1802.28s)]
*  But then you have other factors that play in. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1804.52s)]
*  Japan virtually lets in no immigrants. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1805.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1807.96s)]
*  But that's a completely homogeneous society, unlike our society. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1809.3999999999999s)]
*  And to be really frank, many Japanese want to keep it that way. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1814.28s)]
*  And somehow, I think in certain places, maybe some mindset and mentality has to change, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1817.8799999999999s)]
*  or you have to get to such a crisis point that you just have to deal. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1823.4s)]
*  You have to make the hard decision. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1828.1200000000001s)]
*  And I feel like leadership is increasingly defined these days by making hard decisions [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1829.88s)]
*  that you have no choice but to make, which to me isn't really leadership at all. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1837.88s)]
*  Yeah. And we should note a few places have tried it out. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1843.24s)]
*  And it's continuing to be interesting to watch Germany under Angela Merkel, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1845.8000000000002s)]
*  letting close to a million, mostly Syrian migrants, illegalize them and found a way to, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1849.48s)]
*  in the German way, not to be a cliche, but it's true. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1855.16s)]
*  They brought them in, they trained them, apprentice them, or whatever needed to be done. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1858.3600000000001s)]
*  These are people who are integrating into German society and are strengthening it. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1862.44s)]
*  And in addition to helping them, their own plight. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1866.3600000000001s)]
*  And it can be done. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1869.24s)]
*  Germany is in a lot of ways a unique country. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1870.52s)]
*  And it also had paid politically. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1872.52s)]
*  Its right has surged in resentment to some of this. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1873.96s)]
*  And there's more people than ever trying to get to Germany. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1877.08s)]
*  Through the Southern rim of the Mediterranean countries and so forth. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1879.32s)]
*  But they showed it can be done. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1883.3999999999999s)]
*  And then you have other countries like the Nordics that have plowed money into supporting [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1885.0s)]
*  family growth to try to increase their birth levels and so forth. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1888.76s)]
*  Because it becomes a civilizational thing. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1891.96s)]
*  And there's the sort of blood and soil nationalism aspect as well. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1893.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1897.8s)]
*  So Bob, 2023 was filled with major elections. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1898.52s)]
*  There were Argentina, the Netherlands, Thailand, Poland, and more. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1902.6799999999998s)]
*  However, 2024 is something of a super election year. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1906.84s)]
*  There will be elections in 40 countries. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1910.44s)]
*  2024's voters make up 41% of the world's population and 42% of global GDP. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1913.08s)]
*  With this seismic change in leadership, how well do you think democracy will hold next year? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1919.8s)]
*  Hoo boy. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1925.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, we've been building to this so far, right? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1926.6s)]
*  This podcast. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1929.0s)]
*  It seems like every year there's a hold your breath moment with multiple elections. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1930.76s)]
*  We certainly had them this year. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1935.08s)]
*  And actually, again, just as we were coming in to tape the podcast, there's news that Poland [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1936.28s)]
*  was in fact going to be bringing in, ushering in a new government, a more reform-minded government, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1940.36s)]
*  a more pro-EU government after a great deal of internal maneuverings and working through [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1944.9199999999998s)]
*  processes that based on the latest result, the government that had been leading it, the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1950.76s)]
*  nationalist, very high nationalist government of the last eight years is moving out. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1955.0s)]
*  And there's a more reformist government coming into Poland. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1958.84s)]
*  At the same time, the Netherlands, here at Wielder's, won a majority of the seats, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1962.2s)]
*  but not a ruling majority. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1966.52s)]
*  And there's a question of whether he's going to be able to put together a coalition [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1968.28s)]
*  and in some ways moderate some of his anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim statements [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1971.32s)]
*  to be able to build a governable coalition in the Netherlands because that was quite a bit of a [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1975.24s)]
*  shock for that country. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1980.76s)]
*  We're seeing in Argentina, the libertarian candidate Javier Millet, who campaigned on a [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1982.2s)]
*  great deal of radical policies, including getting rid of the peso, stepping back a little bit from [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1987.3999999999999s)]
*  some of his harsh comments, including some of his personal ones. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1992.4399999999998s)]
*  The pope is no longer an evil person. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1995.1599999999999s)]
*  He's actually one of Argentina's most famous and most important citizens. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=1996.6799999999998s)]
*  So I say that to say that there is a great deal of theater that's going into these elections, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2001.32s)]
*  and then there's a little bit of pragmatism that comes in. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2005.8799999999999s)]
*  But undeniably, there's also a change factor that we have to be concerned about. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2008.04s)]
*  There's just a tumult factor as well. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2012.4399999999998s)]
*  First election coming up in the year ahead, as you staked out, almost half the planet voting [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2014.4399999999998s)]
*  is in Taiwan, which is a sovereign entity with high degrees of functioning democratic [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2018.76s)]
*  institutions, by the way, in which China is very intent on trying to undermine. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2024.28s)]
*  They would like to have a pro-China candidate elected president there from the Kuomintang [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2029.32s)]
*  Party. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2033.9599999999998s)]
*  It seems like the existing party, the Democratic Progressive Party's candidate, is going to be [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2034.6799999999998s)]
*  the winner there, which is going to set in motion further rounds of tensions, maybe some [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2040.36s)]
*  gestures from China. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2044.6799999999998s)]
*  It's not above sending a few military flights over or some sort of demonstration in the [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2046.12s)]
*  straits of Taiwan to show its displeasure with Taiwan's assertiveness of its sovereignty. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2050.52s)]
*  So Taiwan is one to watch. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2055.48s)]
*  Mid-January, those elections take place. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2056.92s)]
*  And then there's a whole series of other big ones. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2059.24s)]
*  Asia is going to be a place where most of the people vote. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2061.0s)]
*  The very next month, February, Indonesia, huge sprawling democracy, largest Muslim [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2063.88s)]
*  population in the world, is holding an election in which it seems like the current president, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2069.72s)]
*  Joko Widodo, is trying to entrench a dynasty by having his son run as the running mate of [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2073.8799999999997s)]
*  an extremely authoritarian-minded defense minister, Prabowo Subianto. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2079.3999999999996s)]
*  So we're going to have to watch Indonesia very closely and see what direction they go in. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2084.8399999999997s)]
*  There are going to be elections in the spring or set to take place in the spring in India, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2088.52s)]
*  the largest democracy in the world, where Narendra Modi has done quite extraordinary [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2091.8799999999997s)]
*  things actually in raising India's geopolitical role and in boosting their economy, but also has [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2096.76s)]
*  really raised up Hindu nationalism there in concerning ways. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2102.6000000000004s)]
*  India has a track record though of running very straightforward, solid elections. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2106.6000000000004s)]
*  So we'll have to see how that policy plays out. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2110.36s)]
*  And that's a very time-consuming election that will take many weeks to kind of play out. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2112.28s)]
*  South Africa's election is going to be hard fought. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2116.76s)]
*  There are some conjecture that the African National Congress, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2119.0s)]
*  with the long-time dominant party in post-apartheid South Africa, is going to [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2122.36s)]
*  finally fall aside. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2126.6800000000003s)]
*  Others think it'll muster through. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2127.96s)]
*  But it's one after the other. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2129.88s)]
*  There's a sense of big things at stake and it's not clear what's going to happen. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2131.5600000000004s)]
*  MS. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2135.0800000000004s)]
*  One question I'm curious about, I'm not an election expert in terms of the mechanics, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2135.4s)]
*  does one election impact other elections globally? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2139.48s)]
*  So if a strong man wins in Indonesia, does that mean that it's going to have some sort of an [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2143.1600000000003s)]
*  influence on an election in another country and who does well there? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2148.92s)]
*  Is that really a thing or is it really more about local and national interests? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2152.92s)]
*  MS. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2157.4s)]
*  That's a really good question. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2157.8s)]
*  And I think you could exaggerate that aspect of this tide happening in a region where there's so [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2159.0s)]
*  many different countries. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2165.16s)]
*  But let's look at Europe. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2166.12s)]
*  The populist parties, and most of them are of the right, they're not all right wing, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2167.16s)]
*  but most of them are of the right wing. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2170.6800000000003s)]
*  They've galvanized each other. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2172.04s)]
*  Hirt Wilder's win was that registered among the AfD party in Germany, for example, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2174.12s)]
*  and some of the other rightist parties. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2179.8799999999997s)]
*  It was welcomed by somebody like Viktor Orbán of Hungary, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2182.9199999999996s)]
*  who proudly touts his illiberal approach to democratic governance. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2186.4399999999996s)]
*  And so depending on the region, it can have a galvanizing effect. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2190.9199999999996s)]
*  Javier Emile was cheered by libertarians in the United States, for example, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2193.9599999999996s)]
*  and former President Trump expressed desire to go to his swearing in, for example. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2197.48s)]
*  So there is that registering effect. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2203.08s)]
*  I recall even in a referendum vote, the Brexit vote in the summer of 2016, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2204.6s)]
*  that I think was a real boost to populist forces in certain places, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2209.16s)]
*  and especially in the United States. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2213.32s)]
*  What's interesting about that, I would note, however, is given the UK's performance in the [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2214.92s)]
*  Brexit period, I think it's chilled a lot of this sort of exit type campaign. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2219.96s)]
*  You've seen even in France among their nationalists, you're not seeing as much [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2224.28s)]
*  sort of call for exiting the EU as you are for other policies, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2228.44s)]
*  especially anti-immigration measures and things like that. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2231.96s)]
*  As I said, you should have a dose of sort of pragmatism as you look at the way these [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2235.6400000000003s)]
*  results play out. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2239.88s)]
*  Italy is another one where everybody was really concerned about the candidate Maloney winning [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2241.1600000000003s)]
*  and her party's roots in sort of fascist Italy in the pre-World War II era. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2245.88s)]
*  She's been a bit more pragmatic on a number of fronts as well. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2250.6s)]
*  Bob, we spent a lot of time in previous years talking about Russian interference in elections, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2254.4399999999996s)]
*  and certainly their return on investment is pretty high if you look at what [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2261.0s)]
*  Orban is doing right now in holding up aid for Ukraine. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2264.8399999999997s)]
*  Do we see any Russian meddling, whether sending money or disinformation in any of these [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2268.9199999999996s)]
*  elections, or is Moscow so otherwise engaged, including a major cyber attack right now in Kyiv? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2273.7999999999997s)]
*  They seem to be routinely active in the European elections, Carla. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2280.44s)]
*  They were running a pretty big campaign, for example, in the recent Slovak elections that [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2284.7599999999998s)]
*  brought back a populist figure there. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2288.12s)]
*  Fyato, yeah. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2290.68s)]
*  Fyato, who is against sort of bolstering aid to Ukraine and has taken a number of positions that [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2291.48s)]
*  are sort of seen as pro-Russian. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2297.0s)]
*  There are other issues at play in Slovakia, but it's safe to say that Russia is going to be [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2299.4s)]
*  active in those areas. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2303.96s)]
*  It's going to be active in the Balkans. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2305.4s)]
*  I think this coming week, for example, there's going to be some parliamentary elections in [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2307.56s)]
*  Serbia. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2310.92s)]
*  You can count on some sort of Russian nefarious disinformation campaigns. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2311.4s)]
*  It's really built in. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2315.96s)]
*  And by the way, it's quite sophisticated in the way they sort of integrate themselves into local [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2316.84s)]
*  debates and create all sorts of misdirection and outright false information to sort of sully the [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2321.32s)]
*  waters. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2328.36s)]
*  So Russia is definitely involved there. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2328.7599999999998s)]
*  What's interesting is the extent to which non-Russian countries will be covering the [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2330.7599999999998s)]
*  Russian elections. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2335.48s)]
*  So Russian elections are being held in March. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2336.28s)]
*  No doubt Putin is going to be getting a rubber stamp. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2338.84s)]
*  I'm biting my nails over that one. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2341.48s)]
*  Are you biting your nails? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2342.6800000000003s)]
*  But he's concerned enough that he's holding the elections, which is something you see again and [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2344.44s)]
*  again with autocrats. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2347.88s)]
*  Well, you don't see it with the Chinese. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2349.4s)]
*  But he is concerned enough to hold elections and be able to say he's being returned by popular [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2350.76s)]
*  decree. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2355.48s)]
*  And worryingly so, we have seen recent reports that Alexei Navalny has disappeared from his [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2356.36s)]
*  penal colony. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2361.88s)]
*  He hasn't been seen in almost a week. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2362.84s)]
*  He was in very bad shape at the last reports that we saw. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2364.52s)]
*  And here's someone who was put away for something like 18 or 19 years, had lost a lot of his voice [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2367.64s)]
*  and his clout, and yet was enough of a concern that Russia is continuing to press on him and to [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2373.24s)]
*  silence him as much as it can. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2378.36s)]
*  And we're not sure whether he's going to emerge again or not. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2380.12s)]
*  So it's just a case of how do you penetrate Russian society that's been so closed off and [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2383.72s)]
*  that they punish even the use of the word war in relation to Ukraine? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2388.52s)]
*  How do you then penetrate that so that people can sort of know what their choices are and what [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2391.88s)]
*  their options are? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2396.12s)]
*  The answer is it's very different. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2397.2400000000002s)]
*  Obviously, Russia has an imbalance there where they can exploit open Western societies. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2398.36s)]
*  But there's still a way to get information through in this kind of wired age we're in. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2402.92s)]
*  And so it will be interesting to see what sort of approach, let's say, Western-funded media [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2406.44s)]
*  organizations, and I'm thinking of my old shop, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, how much they're [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2410.92s)]
*  going to try to cover the issues at hand, the state of Russian society, and whether or not people [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2414.84s)]
*  will make a decision to not vote or hold their nose and vote for some sort of token candidate, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2421.08s)]
*  which we've seen in the past. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2425.56s)]
*  Well, I deliberately did not mention one election coming up at the end of the year, which is the [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2427.56s)]
*  big one that most countries are looking towards, and that's the U.S. presidential election. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2431.88s)]
*  Carla, we're closing out our discussion on this election because it has outsized importance on [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2435.48s)]
*  the world stage. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2441.24s)]
*  So is the world prepared for a second Biden term or return of Donald Trump potentially? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2442.92s)]
*  I think we cue the theme song from Jaws right now. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2448.84s)]
*  Bob, you recall the sharp hit U.S. standing took during the George W. Bush years, especially after [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2453.0s)]
*  the 2003 Iraq War, and all the reporting on U.S. post-911 excesses, and also the financial crisis. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2458.6800000000003s)]
*  And once Obama was elected, there was this collective sigh of relief that America had [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2465.7200000000003s)]
*  returned to its senses. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2470.04s)]
*  And the wave of relief after Biden was elected was different and much more cautious. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2472.28s)]
*  U.S. allies were really traumatized by the Trump years. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2476.76s)]
*  The former president's threats to abandon NATO, pull U.S. troops out of Germany, the attempt to [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2479.32s)]
*  shake down South Korea and Japan, all that pandering to Putin and Kim Jong-un. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2484.1200000000003s)]
*  Many European leaders were questioning the reliability of the U.S. system as much as the [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2489.2400000000002s)]
*  leader throughout all that Trump years. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2493.6400000000003s)]
*  And then you had January 6 and the gridlock in Capitol Hill and Trump's continued dominance [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2495.88s)]
*  of the Republican Party have all continued to reinforce those doubts. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2501.0s)]
*  And the latest sign, of course, what we were talking about this fight over whether the U.S. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2505.32s)]
*  Congress will approve additional funding for Ukraine. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2508.6000000000004s)]
*  And really, every time I talk to a European official, the question is, is he going to come back? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2511.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's really, you don't even have to ask them who they're talking about when they ask. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2519.7200000000003s)]
*  They're talking about Trump. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2524.1200000000003s)]
*  I heard Senator J.D. Vance from Ohio telling CNN when he was talking about Ukraine, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2525.4s)]
*  what's in America's best interest is to accept Ukraine is going to have to cede some territory [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2531.48s)]
*  to the Russians and we need to bring this war to a close. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2535.96s)]
*  So I can't have a conversation with a European diplomat or with an Asian diplomat for that matter, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2538.92s)]
*  in which the first question is, is he going to win? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2544.68s)]
*  And if he wins, how much worse is it going to be than last time? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2547.16s)]
*  Danielle Pletka My conversations are similar without delving too much into it because they [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2549.88s)]
*  tend to be off the record. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2555.72s)]
*  But I will ask, I mean, let's just say that Nikki Haley ends up winning the whole thing. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2557.4s)]
*  Let's just say it happens. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2562.92s)]
*  Carla, how different will things really be? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2564.36s)]
*  Carla Bickford Well, you know, which Nikki Haley are we talking about? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2567.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a really interesting question. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2571.0s)]
*  You had Nikki Haley, who was the ambassador to the UN for Donald Trump. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2573.2400000000002s)]
*  She speaks like an internationalist these days. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2578.92s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of hope that people are putting on that she represents much more of a, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2581.08s)]
*  if not a George H.W. Bush Republican, at least a George W. Bush Republican, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2586.36s)]
*  and more of an internationalist engaged in the world Republican. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2590.84s)]
*  You know, that Bush Baker Republican Party has been pretty weak. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2594.44s)]
*  You don't even hear Romney speaking particularly fiercely these days. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2597.96s)]
*  We thought perhaps he or Mitch McConnell were going to go to the mattresses over aid for Ukraine. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2601.7200000000003s)]
*  And right now, all they're talking about is the Democrats have to compromise on immigration, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2606.6s)]
*  or even we aren't going to back the funding for Ukraine. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2610.1200000000003s)]
*  So hard to tell who Nikki Haley is, because it's hard to tell who the Republican Party is. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2613.0s)]
*  John O'Brien Yeah, I think part of it is also what Americans see themselves as, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2617.56s)]
*  how American society organizes itself and how it comes through a real test here. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2622.36s)]
*  We talk about the rest of the world and their ability to hold free and fair elections. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2626.76s)]
*  But that's part of one of the big stories of this year. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2630.44s)]
*  Will the US be able to hold elections that are, by their merits, held properly, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2633.16s)]
*  the counting is done properly, and then that are not going to be undermined by subterfuge, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2638.9199999999996s)]
*  by willfulness, by claims of a losing candidate. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2643.72s)]
*  And that was a huge test, obviously, in the 2020 elections, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2647.24s)]
*  yielded the January 6 Capitol Hill attack, still shocking, and is now being denied by [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2651.16s)]
*  too many people. But it's a sense of the US in terms of its ability to run a successful election, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2657.7999999999997s)]
*  an incredible election. And then it's a sense of itself internationally, even if it comes through [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2664.44s)]
*  this test. What does it see as its place in the world? Does it want to be a leader in the world? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2669.0s)]
*  You get the sense of a country that's kind of wearied, you know, whether it's the JD [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2673.56s)]
*  fans type comments you mentioned, Carla, or comments by more veteran lawmakers, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2677.48s)]
*  you get a sense that collectively, they're kind of tired of the US playing this major assertive [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2681.64s)]
*  role in bailing out countries like Ukraine around the world and wanting to take care [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2687.32s)]
*  of its own business first. This is this border versus Ukraine debate. It's hugely politicized, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2691.0s)]
*  obviously, but there is an element there that's striking a chord with people, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2696.04s)]
*  especially Republicans, but not exclusively, certainly some independents. And it's a question [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2700.68s)]
*  of what the country sees its role in the world and its sense of security in the world. What's also odd [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2705.8s)]
*  as we go into this year is, you know, we're wrapping up the year with the US economy, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2711.24s)]
*  sort of the envy of the developed world in a lot of ways in terms of its growth levels, its strengths, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2714.68s)]
*  and yet there's a great deal of angst and disappointment and frustration in many, many places, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2721.0s)]
*  especially many places that hold sort of a swing voting role going into this year. So I just, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2727.4s)]
*  I feel like it's just a giant gut check for the US domestically, and then that has a through line [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2732.92s)]
*  to its global posture. I think, Bob, you've made an incredibly important point here, which is [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2738.04s)]
*  people can disagree about US responsibility internationally. There's been an enormous, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2744.84s)]
*  history of the United States debating our level of commitment internationally. Are we more of an [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2750.52s)]
*  isolationist country? Are we going out in search of monsters to slay and all of that? But our [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2756.52s)]
*  commitment to democracy, our commitment to fair play, not questioning the results of elections, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2762.76s)]
*  that's what has been so disturbing since 2020, questioning the fundamental rules of the game here. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2768.76s)]
*  That didn't happen in this country before. Am I going to guarantee that I'm going to get [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2774.52s)]
*  death threats now? Not just from Trump, but from Trump world, Carla. So, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2778.28s)]
*  well, and on that note, we wrap up The World Next Year. To all our regular listeners, we've [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwA-cDF6yBo&t=2785.2400000000002s)]
