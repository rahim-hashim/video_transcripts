# COP28 in Dubai, Russia Crackdown on Journalists, China Illness Spike, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM)
*  In the coming week, the COP28 climate summit gets underway in the UAE, and the latest Russian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=0.0s)]
*  detention of a U.S. journalist raises concern. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  It's November 30, 2023, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=10.92s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=27.36s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=28.56s)]
*  So Bob, let's begin in Dubai. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=29.56s)]
*  Today is the start of COP28, the annual UN climate change summit. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=32.72s)]
*  There are going to be some 60,000 participants, including scores of world leaders, attending. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  And this year, one of the main outcomes is a so-called global stock take, and this is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  the first formal assessment of progress or lack of progress the world has made toward [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=46.56s)]
*  mitigating global warming since the Paris agreement was first negotiated in 2015. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=51.44s)]
*  There's a lot of concern that we're falling further and further behind the 1.5 degrees [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=57.24s)]
*  Celsius goal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=61.36s)]
*  And there's also concern about this year's host. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=62.36s)]
*  The UAE is a major oil and gas producer, and the BBC reported earlier this week that they [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=64.8s)]
*  had seen some briefing documents that showed that the UAE was cynically planning to use [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  the conference to discuss fossil fuel deals with more than a dozen nations. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=73.84s)]
*  So was this really disturbing as it sounds, or are they going to make some progress? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=79.2s)]
*  So the atmospherics around the COP28 this year are not the greatest, Carla. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=84.64s)]
*  It's been raised in many, many places, and the ironies abound. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=89.84s)]
*  But we should still look at this as an important gathering that could still hold some indicators [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=94.98s)]
*  about the trajectory of climate policies. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=99.4s)]
*  And it's a vast array of policies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=101.84s)]
*  It starts with, though, this ability to limit, slow, zero out eventually emissions, and having [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=104.88s)]
*  an official in a country which has larger oil and gas deposits than Russia hosting does [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  not seem to bode well. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=117.92s)]
*  The report you mentioned has gotten a lot of attention about the documents indicating [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=119.48s)]
*  there was going to be a lot of deal making going on. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=123.2s)]
*  It was denied by the chair, Sultan Al-Jubeir, who is also the CEO of Adnok, the UAE's state [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  oil company. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=131.6s)]
*  Who better than he to chair a climate change conference? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=132.6s)]
*  His disclaimer included a line something to the effect of that, well, we would not need [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=134.52s)]
*  a climate summit to do such deals. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=139.56s)]
*  That's sort of nonsense. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=141.76s)]
*  So that's a disclaimer. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=143.2s)]
*  We should also mention there's also going to be a lot of numbers flying around. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=145.04s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of numbers that are somewhat confusing as well to note. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=147.96s)]
*  Let's just be clear. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=151.2s)]
*  There are clear facts. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=152.2s)]
*  Anybody who's lived through this year on the planet knows that there were climate extremes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=153.74s)]
*  that we had not seen, at least people who are living today had not seen before in 2023. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=158.26s)]
*  The UN's weather agency said 2023 is now certain to be the hottest year on record. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=163.32s)]
*  It has all sorts of implications for increasing floods, wildfires, glacier melt, heat waves [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=169.16s)]
*  in the future. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  And that the average temperature for the year is up close to that figure of pre-industrial [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=175.8s)]
*  times that limited figure. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=181.48s)]
*  So 1.5 degrees Celsius. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=182.76s)]
*  It's getting very close to that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  It's about a one-tenth of a degree Fahrenheit under the target limit for the end of the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=186.24s)]
*  century as laid out by the Paris Climate Accord in 2015. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=190.64s)]
*  The stock take you mentioned or report card, however you want to term it, is important. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=194.72s)]
*  It's going to be important for the countries assembled to go over that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=199.04s)]
*  And this year it's going to be very important about whether there's going to be commitments [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  that some countries are pushing for to start to set some firmer deadlines for phasing out [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=205.56s)]
*  oil and gas production. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=210.88s)]
*  It's important to note the United States, which has certainly made strides under the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=212.84s)]
*  Biden administration to move towards cleaner energy and under the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  huge initial investments in that realm. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=221.88s)]
*  But it's also extracting a record-breaking amount of oil and gas. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  The numbers are really high. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=228.44s)]
*  And as long as you're extracting that much, you're going to be using that much. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=230.32s)]
*  And these are also business models. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=233.88s)]
*  And so there's business decisions that are made based on what guidelines and what regulations [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=235.32s)]
*  countries are allowing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=240.28s)]
*  So that's a long way of saying we're going to be looking to this gathering for some signs [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=241.52s)]
*  that there'll be some real meaningful slowing down in a shorter timeline of oil and gas [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  emissions. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  It's really difficult target to hit. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  And also, further acknowledgement that changes are happening already. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=255.0s)]
*  Countries are facing enormous damages already. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=258.96s)]
*  Countries that have had very little to do with emissions are facing the biggest damages, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=261.12s)]
*  Pacific Island nations. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=264.76s)]
*  So the summit kicked off today. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=266.4s)]
*  We're taping this on Thursday with the confirmation that there will be the Loss and Damage Fund, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=268.72s)]
*  the scope of which is still going to be defined starting in the course of this summit, which [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=273.0s)]
*  runs until December 12th. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=277.12s)]
*  And so this Loss and Damages Fund has been discussed. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=279.48s)]
*  And even before that, there was this Green Fund. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=285.32s)]
*  There's been lots of money that somehow never shows up. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=287.48s)]
*  And it is not just for damages. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  It's also to help countries mitigate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  And certainly, some countries are just going to be underwater. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=298.0s)]
*  Other places are suffering disproportionate, but also for adaptation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=300.68s)]
*  So there was some talk about $100 billion by 2030. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=304.56s)]
*  Other people are saying it's going to have to be trillions. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=309.44s)]
*  And there seems to be a mismatch between like the EU is talking about billions and billions [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=312.32s)]
*  and billions. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=316.68s)]
*  The United States seems to not even be there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=317.68s)]
*  And we're certainly a very wealthy country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=319.56s)]
*  Do you have any sense of the scale? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  And is this gap between what the US is thinking about and what the Europeans thinking about? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=323.68s)]
*  That doesn't seem to bode very well for success on that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=329.28s)]
*  No, and it's an ongoing disconnect in some ways. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=332.32s)]
*  First of all, I think the UN has estimated something like $387 billion with a B is going [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=335.76s)]
*  to be needed annually to help developing nations that are most vulnerable adapt to climate [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=340.96s)]
*  change. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=345.36s)]
*  And as you said, these are Pacific Island nations that are disappearing, that are going [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=346.36s)]
*  to have to consolidate their populations on higher atolls and things like that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=349.4s)]
*  But it's not just those countries. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=353.08s)]
*  I mean, there are countries in Africa which are blistering heat and crops being destroyed [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=354.36s)]
*  and people being dislocated, huge numbers of climate migrants. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=359.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's any number of things. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=362.96s)]
*  We talked about somewhat previously on this podcast, there's the how do you adapt to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=364.2s)]
*  extreme heat? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=368.04s)]
*  You know, bringing in air conditioning systems in countries that just don't have them at [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=369.04s)]
*  all so that 130 degree heat can be, you can survive it and then not only survive it, but [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=373.2s)]
*  then what does that mean for livelihoods and other things? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=379.16s)]
*  So yeah, across the board, there are many, many things that need to be addressed. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=380.92s)]
*  And it's not clear when a US administration is going to be able to commit to meaningful [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=384.92s)]
*  amounts of money for something like this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=388.90000000000003s)]
*  Biden administration definitely seems to be intent on trying to support it in ways it [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=390.66s)]
*  can, but ultimately meaningful money comes through congressional authorization. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=394.98s)]
*  And the US Congress is not there yet. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=398.74s)]
*  There are a lot of Republican lawmakers who still will not make the connection between [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=400.74s)]
*  human caused reasons for climate change or that there is climate change in some respects. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=405.54s)]
*  So that's going to be a continuing problem. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=410.5s)]
*  Remember, the previous Republican administration under Donald Trump removed the US from the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=412.22s)]
*  Paris Accords and defunded some of the things the US had committed to. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=415.82s)]
*  So there's a reversibility to some commitments as well on the US side. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=418.98s)]
*  And the Europeans, you know, they in some cases have been slow in following through on [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=422.86s)]
*  some of their commitments. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=426.5s)]
*  It's not to say other things aren't happening. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=427.82s)]
*  There's a lot of interest in private sector involvement, but this gets to other issues [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=430.1s)]
*  beyond the mitigation one. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=436.06s)]
*  The mitigation one seems to be something that is going to need to have countries involved [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=437.42s)]
*  in really committing to to bolstering and committing to some norms and how communities [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=441.14s)]
*  are developed, how coastal communities are developed, among other things. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=445.58s)]
*  While it is definitely disproportionately hitting the weaker countries, the rich countries [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=448.7s)]
*  are dealing with their own issues, too. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  So the two largest emitters are China and the United States. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=455.06s)]
*  And we did see a few weeks ago we talked about it, that there was on the sidelines of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=461.34s)]
*  APEC that there was an agreement between the Chinese and the US to make some progress on [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=466.06s)]
*  greenhouse gases. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=472.38s)]
*  And Chinese for the first time, we're talking about methane. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=473.5s)]
*  Everybody seemed to be somewhat heartened by this. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=475.38s)]
*  But neither President Biden nor Xi Jinping plans to attend the summit. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=478.26s)]
*  Do we know why that is and how much progress can be made if those two leaders are able? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=484.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if they had ever fully planned to go to the summit. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=490.14s)]
*  It was always mentioned that John Kerry, the US climate envoy, and Xi Jinping, if I [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=494.53999999999996s)]
*  pronounce that correctly, the Chinese envoy, were going to be there and trying to follow [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=499.46s)]
*  on some of the dialogue that had been seemingly had some momentum at the sidelines of the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  APEC summit earlier this month and that presidents will go when they have something to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=509.53999999999996s)]
*  kind of cap off or point to. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=514.5s)]
*  And I don't know whether there's enough going on there. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=516.3s)]
*  For example, if the US and China had come to some common cause on phasing out coal fired [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=519.02s)]
*  plants or something like that, for example, just to cite one example, you know, that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=524.86s)]
*  could be the cause for coming together or some sort of commitment to renewable energy [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=528.66s)]
*  that the two sides were going to come together on. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=532.78s)]
*  But I don't think there was a there there for them to come to and kind of fasten on to, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  not that they don't for their own reasons see this as important. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=539.5s)]
*  But but I think it's there wasn't a big enough reason for them to come. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=543.06s)]
*  There are some leaders there, obviously. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  President Lula of Brazil is going to be there. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=547.98s)]
*  Rishi Sunak of the UK, also King Charles is going as well. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  And the new foreign secretary, David Cameron there. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=553.9s)]
*  So there's a big UK contingent. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=556.22s)]
*  And the pope is going right. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=557.82s)]
*  Pope was going to go. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=559.02s)]
*  He's not going. He's been in poor health recently. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=560.5s)]
*  This was on his calendar for a while. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=564.1s)]
*  And he has been and usually strong voice from the Vatican on this issue, including [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=565.7s)]
*  papal encyclical on climate change. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=570.94s)]
*  So it's lost a bit of that luster. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  This is a long summit, though. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  Can't rule it out. For whatever reason, there's a bit of a momentum gets flowing and we [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=576.3s)]
*  come into next week and it's like, hey, guess who's coming? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=580.02s)]
*  So it's still something to watch. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=582.42s)]
*  But I think it's a remoter prospect right now. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=583.94s)]
*  And it's it's more like what are some of the nuts and bolts things that can emerge from [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=586.06s)]
*  this? We've heard of carbon sequestration and things that private sector can get excited [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=589.26s)]
*  about, for example, and then alternative energy investment. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=593.38s)]
*  Maybe there's some sort of boost there. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=596.78s)]
*  But they overtone here back to your original framing of the question, Carla, is that it's [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=598.62s)]
*  a heavy fossil fuel reliant country hosting this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=603.26s)]
*  There are an enormous amount of members of the fossil fuel business community attending [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=606.78s)]
*  the largest ever attendance, I think, of any cop, by the way. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=611.62s)]
*  So it does not seem to present a great deal of hope that we're we're going to look to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=614.7s)]
*  2023 as any sort of a tipping point in global policy. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=619.3s)]
*  Not a tipping point in global policy, even though we are very, very close to the tipping [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=623.06s)]
*  point of what Paris committed to, which is holding it to one point five above [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=627.66s)]
*  pre-industrial levels. And we are, as you said, just a teeny, teeny, teeny bit away [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=632.9s)]
*  from it. One would hope that that stock take would be the real wake up call. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=637.42s)]
*  And I understand that presidents are very conscious about deliverables, but there is [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=642.62s)]
*  something to be said for leadership and maybe just by being there, they could make a [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=647.8199999999999s)]
*  difference. I'm really surprised that Biden in particular, who put so much political [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=653.58s)]
*  commitment to it and who right now politically at home is having a hard time with young [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=658.3s)]
*  voters. He's missing this opportunity. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=663.58s)]
*  I understand he sent his vice president, but honestly and truly, I really think you [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=666.3s)]
*  should be there. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=670.42s)]
*  Yes. And we'll see again whether there's any sort of a really true summit level kind [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=671.74s)]
*  of pressure that comes to bear in this conference or whether it's a kind of a talking [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=676.62s)]
*  shop that leaves people feeling a bit blah at the end, Carla. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=680.74s)]
*  We'll pick it up, though, on this podcast and take stock ourselves in a couple of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=684.1s)]
*  weeks. Carla, I want to change gears and talk about something else, which is a clamp [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=687.82s)]
*  down on journalists in Russia. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=691.58s)]
*  In particular, there is a upcoming pretrial detention date for next Tuesday of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=693.46s)]
*  Alsuk Komarcheva, who is a journalist employed by the US-funded Radio Free Europe [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=699.3s)]
*  Radio Liberty. Carla, full disclosure, I was a former longtime employee of RFERL in [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=703.62s)]
*  Prague. So Komarcheva, she has been in Russian custody since October. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=708.3s)]
*  She's the second US citizen. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=711.6999999999999s)]
*  She's by the way, she's a joint US-Russian citizen, but she's a second US citizen [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=713.3399999999999s)]
*  detained after Evan Gorshkovich of the Wall Street Journal. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=717.78s)]
*  And he's had his sentence extended. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=721.3s)]
*  I think I can't remember the most recent. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=724.26s)]
*  His pretrial detention. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=725.66s)]
*  It continues to be extended. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=727.14s)]
*  And previous cases of detainees of US citizens tended to end up in some sort of a [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=728.7s)]
*  swap type of arrangement. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=734.62s)]
*  Potentially, we saw that happen with the US basketball player, Brittany Greiner, most [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  recently. But what do we know about the chances that Alsuk will even have a trial, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=740.1s)]
*  let alone a fair one? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=744.7s)]
*  Well, as we've seen with Evan Gorshkovich, you know, things move very slowly and very [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=745.98s)]
*  disturbingly. And it is really tough to be a journalist in Russia, whether you are an [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=751.46s)]
*  American journalist or a Russian journalist. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=755.62s)]
*  It's a bad place to be practicing our profession right now. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=758.42s)]
*  Also, Khromysheva, or is it Khromysheva, is a Russian-American journalist and editor, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=762.14s)]
*  as you said, from RFERL of the Tatar Bashkir Service. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=767.0600000000001s)]
*  By the way, is based in Prague. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=771.46s)]
*  Yes, based in Prague. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=772.74s)]
*  And in May, and her family is there, her husband also works for, she's head of the, is [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=774.0600000000001s)]
*  it Current Time? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=778.26s)]
*  Current Time TV, yes. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=779.22s)]
*  TV. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=780.14s)]
*  Poblatorium. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=780.1800000000001s)]
*  And in May, she traveled to Kazan, which is a city about 500 miles east of Moscow, to [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=781.26s)]
*  visit her elderly mother. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=786.02s)]
*  And two weeks later, while she was trying to fly back to Prague, where she lives, she [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=788.62s)]
*  was stopped by Russian authorities for failing to notify them formally about her United [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=792.74s)]
*  States citizenship. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=797.4599999999999s)]
*  And they seized both of her passports at the time. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=798.86s)]
*  But the hope was that she could pay a fine and be done with all of this. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=801.86s)]
*  And it was just your basic harassment. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=805.18s)]
*  But you're nothing in Russia, especially when it comes to journalists as simple. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=807.06s)]
*  Months dragged on. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=811.14s)]
*  And then in October, the Russian government announced that she was being charged with [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=812.3s)]
*  something far worse, quote, failing to register as a foreign agent. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=816.38s)]
*  And this is a legal designation that Russia has used for more than a decade to shut down [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=820.66s)]
*  civil society groups and since the invasion of Ukraine, to go after independent media. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=825.62s)]
*  If convicted of this, she could face up to five years in prison. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=831.14s)]
*  So she's now being held in a pretrial detention, as Evan is. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=834.98s)]
*  And she's being held in Kazan in Kazan. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=839.0600000000001s)]
*  And I'm told that the conditions are pretty difficult. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=842.1800000000001s)]
*  Her cell is really cold. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=845.0600000000001s)]
*  There's very little sunlight. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=846.46s)]
*  At times they've moved, you know, three, four additional people into the cell. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=848.3000000000001s)]
*  Some of them have been unmedicated, mentally ill prisoners, people who are do not have [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=852.1s)]
*  the best hygiene and some of whom appear to be threatening. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=857.1s)]
*  There's been requests by American Consular Services to meet with her, which have been [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=860.62s)]
*  denied. While the Russians repeatedly told her that the American embassy has shown no [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=864.3800000000001s)]
*  interest in her case. So they're playing the psychological games with her as well. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=868.74s)]
*  This next court appearance is supposed to review that detention. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=872.46s)]
*  But as we have seen with Evan Gorshkovich repeatedly, such detention periods are [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=876.14s)]
*  extended with no apparent end in sight. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=881.0600000000001s)]
*  She is, of course, the second American journalist to be arrested. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=885.34s)]
*  Gorshkovich has been held since late March, which is nearly eight months, on ginned up [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=888.38s)]
*  espionage charges. And his pre-trial detention, as you said, was just extended to the end [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=892.26s)]
*  of January. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=896.94s)]
*  The US government has designated Evan Gorshkovich as, quote, wrongfully detained, which [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=898.6600000000001s)]
*  effectively means that the American government considers him a political prisoner, which [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=903.58s)]
*  kicks in all sorts of bureaucratic and diplomatic efforts. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=908.2600000000001s)]
*  Brittany Greiner was designated that way as well, as has Paul Whelan, who was a former [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=911.9000000000001s)]
*  US Marine and a corporate executive who's been serving a 16 year sentence on espionage [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=917.2600000000001s)]
*  charges that the United States also says is totally politically motivated. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=922.7s)]
*  So far, they haven't used this designation with also the Committee to Protect Journalists [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=927.14s)]
*  and a dozen other press freedom and freedom of expression groups this week called on the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=933.62s)]
*  Secretary of State Tony Blinken to designate her that way. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=938.74s)]
*  And I know that RFE-RL is pushing this really hard. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=941.5s)]
*  And I don't know why they haven't come up with this designation. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=944.5799999999999s)]
*  It seems there are resources, there's bureaucratic attention. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=947.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't know why they're not pushing this up very well. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=952.42s)]
*  She's an American citizen and she deserves the full attention and support that American [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=954.5799999999999s)]
*  citizens and that journalists deserve for this, because she's clearly wrongfully detained. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=959.66s)]
*  Yeah. And not only for all the reasons you said, Carla, also, you know, it's worth [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=963.6999999999999s)]
*  pointing out what she works for in its role in the current situation. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=968.14s)]
*  You know, certainly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, what had been a bad media situation [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=971.78s)]
*  has gotten much worse. Russians have very narrow prison to get information. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=976.06s)]
*  There's some various sort of telegram outlets and other sort of shadowy media sites that [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=980.3s)]
*  play cat and mouse with Russian authorities are able to get information through. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=985.14s)]
*  But, you know, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty with 24 hour service in Russian and [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=988.14s)]
*  many other languages and in many other languages that are understood by members of the vast [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=993.2199999999999s)]
*  Russian collection of ethnicities, which includes Tatar-Bashkirs, has been an effective [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=997.3399999999999s)]
*  place for gathering information, disseminating it in various platforms. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1003.62s)]
*  And their their journalists face a lot of intimidation across the board in the region, in [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1007.78s)]
*  the authoritarian countries that are still in much of the former Soviet Union, especially [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1012.86s)]
*  Russia. So it's an important signal, I would think, for the government to say, hey, we got [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1016.78s)]
*  your back on this, even though she wasn't over there collecting information per se, she [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1020.9399999999999s)]
*  was there on a personal trip. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1024.46s)]
*  But, you know, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty also broadcast to Iran. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1025.94s)]
*  We've seen this happen to journalists going to Iran or Americans going to Iran. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1030.82s)]
*  It's an important signal. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1034.86s)]
*  And I think you're right. It should follow through. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1035.94s)]
*  There are journalists that RFE-RL employs in Belarus that have been seized as well and [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1038.26s)]
*  other places. So they have two journalists in Belarus who are in jail, as well as the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1043.66s)]
*  wife of one of these journalists has been in jail and a former RFE-RL journalist who's [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1048.18s)]
*  also been in jail for helping the families of this. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1052.8200000000002s)]
*  And RFE-RL also has a journalist who's been jailed in Russian occupied Crimea. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1056.46s)]
*  Listen, it's really dangerous to be a journalist, to work in any of these countries. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1061.26s)]
*  And clearly working for RFE-RL is also is hugely dangerous and deserves all of our [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1065.8999999999999s)]
*  attention the same way Evan Gershkovich's case deserves all of our attention. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1072.3s)]
*  And one more thing on RFE-RL, you know, it's worth noting this is the sort of the US, a [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1076.1799999999998s)]
*  main soft power tool, as been called in the past, but a tool by the US to support journalism [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1080.7399999999998s)]
*  in these regions where there are vacuums and real need for information. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1086.4199999999998s)]
*  The way these countries, especially Russia and let's say China, deploy their journalists [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1090.34s)]
*  are very much in sort of as information warfare and they're not committing journalism. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1095.4599999999998s)]
*  They are out there spreading propaganda. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1100.4199999999998s)]
*  They're taking part in disinformation, as the case may be, and they're very much towing [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1103.1399999999999s)]
*  the state line. So this is a very unbalanced playing field, to say the least. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1107.22s)]
*  But they really need to support the free exercise of journalism as much as possible because [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1111.02s)]
*  it is part, it is a mission that the US supports and should get behind. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1115.34s)]
*  So Putin, of course, had been shutting down independent media for years and years before [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1119.62s)]
*  the Ukraine war. But once the war started down, they put a law in place that criminalized [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1125.1799999999998s)]
*  even the use of the word war, insisting this is a special military operation. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1130.4199999999998s)]
*  And there is no independent media left there. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1135.02s)]
*  And as dangerous as it is for RFE-RL and for American journalists working there, it's hugely [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1137.82s)]
*  dangerous for anybody trying to do the independent exercise. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1142.5s)]
*  And just in the last few months, the Russian court meted out a 10 and a half and 9 and a half [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1145.86s)]
*  year prison sentences to journalists from an independent investigative website. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1151.22s)]
*  And another in October, a Russian blogger was sentenced to eight and a half years on [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1156.06s)]
*  charges of spreading false information about Russian military actions in the Ukraine war, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1160.82s)]
*  something he says, these people basically do local reporting and they said they had [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1164.5s)]
*  nothing to do with Ukraine. They're just going after people right and left. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1168.9s)]
*  And which then puts even more of a premium, whether or not it's somebody working for the [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1172.58s)]
*  Wall Street Journal or the BBC or somebody working for RFE-RL. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1176.78s)]
*  People in Russia need to know what's going on and people in all these other countries need to [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1180.3400000000001s)]
*  know what's going on and also needs to be brought home as Evan needs to be brought home. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1183.6200000000001s)]
*  And we need to remember what's going on with all the journalists inside of Russia. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1189.74s)]
*  Yes. So we'll continue to follow this and we'll see what happens on Tuesday, Karol. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1193.66s)]
*  Yes, certainly. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1197.18s)]
*  Well, we've talked ourselves into the audience figure of the week part of the podcast. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1198.86s)]
*  This is the figure that listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1205.2199999999998s)]
*  org's Instagram story. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1208.9399999999998s)]
*  This week, Karla, our audience selected the WHO asked China for info on spike in illness. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1211.02s)]
*  Uh oh. Is this a December 2019 flashback? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1217.2199999999998s)]
*  Well, certainly that was the fear when the independent program for monitoring emerging [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1220.9399999999998s)]
*  diseases reported a spike in respiratory illnesses and particularly clusters of pneumonia [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1227.1s)]
*  in children in northern China. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1232.9399999999998s)]
*  And there were also these reports that the main Beijing Children's Hospital was being [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1235.34s)]
*  overwhelmed with patients. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1239.1799999999998s)]
*  But this time, both the WHO and the Chinese appear to have done things by the book. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1240.86s)]
*  WHO asked the question, the Chinese immediately answered the questions, which is what's [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1245.8999999999999s)]
*  required under WHO rules. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1250.1s)]
*  The Chinese reported that they've not found any unusual or novel pathogens and the WHO [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1252.5400000000002s)]
*  has put that out there. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1257.42s)]
*  And what they're saying is there is an increase in pneumonia due to bacteria for [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1259.9s)]
*  mycoplasma pneumonia and a rise in influenza, adenovirus and RSV. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1264.18s)]
*  And all this is being explained by the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1270.8200000000002s)]
*  This notion that there's something like an immunity debt. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1276.3000000000002s)]
*  And we saw that in the United States as well when we lifted the restrictions here and we [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1278.5800000000002s)]
*  saw a lot of kids getting RSV. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1282.22s)]
*  So whether this by the book transparency is a sign that Beijing and the WHO have both [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1284.34s)]
*  learned their lessons from the early days of COVID, which you recall China blocked [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1290.54s)]
*  access to critical information, things like they were seeing human to human spread of [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1294.38s)]
*  COVID, just outrageous things that they did. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1298.7s)]
*  And the WHO enabled that. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1301.46s)]
*  So whether they have gotten religion on this or whether the Chinese are willing to share [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1303.3s)]
*  the information because there are no problems here, so they can afford to be that [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1308.18s)]
*  transparent. We have no way of knowing. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1312.5400000000002s)]
*  But right now, if you believe the Chinese and you believe the WHO, this is not deja [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1314.46s)]
*  vu all over again. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1319.6200000000001s)]
*  It's winter and it's, you know, it's bad infections. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1320.7800000000002s)]
*  And let's hope that's all it is. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1324.66s)]
*  Well, it's significant. Our audience seized on it as the figure given that those concerns [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1326.18s)]
*  still linger out there. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1330.22s)]
*  And while this instance may not be anything serious, there's been warnings about other [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1331.3400000000001s)]
*  potential for pandemics, both originating in China and elsewhere out there. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1336.14s)]
*  So any sign that there's some sort of lessons learned or more cooperation should be [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1339.8200000000002s)]
*  welcomed, I guess. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1346.22s)]
*  So I talk to my students a lot about this sort of the lessons of global governance that [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1347.3000000000002s)]
*  came out of COVID or didn't come out of COVID. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1352.7800000000002s)]
*  And these international institutions like the WHO on paper, they have a huge amount of [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1355.0200000000002s)]
*  responsibility to raise alarms. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1361.5s)]
*  And countries have signed on and made commitments that they're supposed to within 24 hours [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1363.8600000000001s)]
*  when asked respond to questions, that they're sharing information. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1368.02s)]
*  And certainly you can see with the pandemic why it would be in everyone's interest for [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1371.42s)]
*  countries to be transparent. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1374.98s)]
*  And there was a time certainly with SARS when the head of the WHO bullied the Chinese into [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1376.6200000000001s)]
*  sharing information. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1381.6200000000001s)]
*  Harder time with Ebola, not with the Chinese, but with African countries. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1383.8600000000001s)]
*  So a lot of it has to do with the leadership because in fact, they don't have troops to go [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1388.06s)]
*  in and invade a country and demand the information. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1392.54s)]
*  So part of it is norm setting. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1394.86s)]
*  Part of it is the willingness of a country to do it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1396.42s)]
*  And it's kind of like the UN itself. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1399.18s)]
*  You have a coalition of the willing that can seize. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1401.02s)]
*  Sometimes you have a UN agency that takes the lead, but sometimes there's just strong [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1403.1399999999999s)]
*  individual nations and strong individual leadership of the institution itself. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1406.74s)]
*  And we still have the same leader of the WHO that we did with COVID. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1410.54s)]
*  And so we don't know if the transparency this time is because they've learned their lesson. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1414.22s)]
*  And this probably is going to be tested again. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1418.7s)]
*  We'll see how soon. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1421.3000000000002s)]
*  Let's hope not too soon. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1422.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, that's our look at the world next week. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1424.0200000000002s)]

*  Brazil takes over the rotating G20 presidency for a year. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aye6WgTiFAM&t=1429.0600000000002s)]
