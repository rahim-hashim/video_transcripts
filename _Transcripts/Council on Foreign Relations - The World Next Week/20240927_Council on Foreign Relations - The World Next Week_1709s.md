# Zelenskyy’s Diplomatic Drive, Japan’s New Leader, U.S. and Canadian Tariffs on China’s EVs, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is)
*  In the coming week, Ukraine intensifies efforts to get a military boost. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=0.0s)]
*  Japan's ruling party chooses a new prime minister. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=4.32s)]
*  And the U.S. and Canada impose 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=7.2s)]
*  It's September 26, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=11.76s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=26.72s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=27.68s)]
*  Carla, let's kick off with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=29.28s)]
*  Quite a visit already. He appeared just the other day at the UN General Assembly's high-level [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  debate where he spoke about the need for what he called global action and warned the country leaders [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=38.96s)]
*  assembled there of Russia's potential to create a nuclear catastrophe, specifically referencing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=44.96s)]
*  their plans to attack nuclear power plants. He also made stops around the country, including [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  to an ammunition plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He is due to meet, as we're taping this podcast [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=55.68s)]
*  today, with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to discuss what he has been calling [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=60.64s)]
*  his Victory Peace Plan. Carla, is any of this going to add up to a bit of difference? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=65.84s)]
*  Zelensky's certainly rolling the dice big time with this visit. We don't know [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=72.08s)]
*  exactly what is in this plan he's presenting to Biden and Harris today, but we have a pretty good [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=76.8s)]
*  idea of what Zelensky says Ukraine needs to force Russia to the negotiating table, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=81.68s)]
*  and that's the premise of this big ask. A specific list of weapons, which he wants delivered before [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  the end of the year, that's the big thing here. He wants, once again, permission to shoot missiles [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=93.76s)]
*  deep inside Russian territory. And they're saying a clear path with a date, perhaps, for a NATO [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  membership. And before his meeting with Zelensky, the White House announced a new $8 billion package [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=105.84s)]
*  of aid for Ukraine, including the first shipment of precision guided glide bombs called the Joint [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=112.08s)]
*  Standoff Weapon. And that does have a range of up to 81 miles, and that would be a major step up in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=117.68s)]
*  capabilities. And they committed additional air defense and training, but we haven't had any word [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=123.28s)]
*  on the other thing that Zelensky is asking for. These are huge asks, and they're not new asks, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=128.88s)]
*  especially any further NATO commitment. Everyone knows Biden couldn't do that himself. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=134.72s)]
*  And permission to hit deep inside Russia, up until now, it doesn't look like it's something [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  Biden wants to give. Every time Zelensky's talked about these things, they've either been delayed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=143.28s)]
*  or deflected. I think what's new is the urgency of the ask and all the attention Zelensky has drawn [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=147.84s)]
*  to his pitch. And part of that, I think, is a measure of the difficulty his troops are facing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=153.92s)]
*  in the battlefield. Russian troops are getting closer to that city of Pokrovsk we've talked [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=159.12s)]
*  about before, this major Ukrainian logistics hub, which supports military operations in eastern [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=163.2s)]
*  Ukraine. And Russian strikes, which is pummeling Ukraine's energy infrastructure, they're going [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=168.56s)]
*  to have a very, very cold winter. And part of that is a big fear of what's going to happen if Trump [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=173.6s)]
*  wins the election. Zelensky's tried really hard not to criticize the former president directly, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  even after Trump refused to say whether he wants Ukraine to win. You remember that in the debate. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=185.6s)]
*  He wanted to get this new package, which he considers absolutely essential to force Russia [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=190.72s)]
*  to the table, quote, while all the officials who want victory for Ukraine are still in official [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=195.52s)]
*  positions. And so we know what all of that means. So Trump, meanwhile, has blown off Zelensky's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  request to meet, at least so far, and present his plan. And Trump is apparently furious that Zelensky [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  in an interview with The New Yorker questioned Trump's claim that he could end the war in a day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  And in the last few days, the former president has begun regularly attacking the Ukrainian [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=218.24s)]
*  on the stump, accusing him of making little nasty aspersions about me, calling Zelensky [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=222.32s)]
*  the greatest salesman, implying that he's ripping off the US for billions of dollars, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=227.44s)]
*  suggesting all that money is being wasted. He used words like obliterated to describe Ukraine, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  and he's claiming that they're using young children and old men to fight. One quote that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=237.6s)]
*  I found particularly extraordinary, he said, those buildings are down, those cities are gone, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=241.6s)]
*  they're gone, and we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=245.52s)]
*  So Trump is close to right about one thing. Zelensky is certainly a great showman, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=251.28s)]
*  and he's clearly hoping that this big pitch is going to help Biden overcome his own doubts. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=255.52s)]
*  So while he's upping the pressure on Biden, he's also upping the pressure on himself. And we have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=260.64s)]
*  to think about the impact at home, both politically and on the battlefield. If he comes home, it won't [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=264.64s)]
*  be completely empty handed he did get this new $8 billion commitment. But as part of this [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=270.88s)]
*  big push, Zelensky gave a raft of interviews, and a writer for the New Yorker asked him what would [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=275.44s)]
*  happen if Biden says no to his victory plan. And Zelensky didn't have much of an answer. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=280.4s)]
*  All he could say was that's a horrible thought. And then he oscillated between criticizing and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=285.84s)]
*  praising Biden. And then his bottom line was we would end up with a very long war, an impossible, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=290.24s)]
*  exhausting situation that would kill a tremendous number of people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=296.32s)]
*  And apropos the timing of this visit, which is in the final weeks of the heated US presidential [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=299.2s)]
*  campaign, there was a visit that I mentioned at the outset to Scranton, Pennsylvania to an [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=306.88s)]
*  ammunition plant, which has seemed to generate a great deal of controversy among Republicans, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=312.0s)]
*  among Republican lawmakers. The Speaker of the House is now said to be not going to meet with [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=316.24s)]
*  Zelensky and has spoken very critically of that visit to the ammunition plant, where reportedly [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=321.12s)]
*  there were at least two Democratic politicians next to Zelensky as he was making his comments. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=326.16s)]
*  And he toured the plant. He was accompanied by Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=330.48s)]
*  with Senator Casey, and with the local congressmen, all Democrats. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=334.72s)]
*  And so this seems to be adding another element to the difficulties Ukraine made face politically in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  the US. Actually, even regardless of what happens on the presidential race, if Congress continues to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=344.56s)]
*  be divided between Republicans and Democrats. So Johnson sent this letter to Zelensky. He's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=349.12s)]
*  demanding the resignation of the Ukrainian ambassador to the US who organized this visit. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=353.92s)]
*  Really, it was great optics for Zelensky. He thanked the workers who were there. I don't [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=360.32s)]
*  know whether or not they tried to get a Republican member of Congress to show up. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he's trying everything he can do to get the American public to understand [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=369.6s)]
*  what he needs. And these artillery shells are really important. Thanking the workers was great [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=375.04s)]
*  television. And the suggestion that he's, quote, intervening in the American campaign in a swing [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=380.4s)]
*  state, outrage, outrage, outrage. To my mind, Johnson's just following what Trump is saying [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=386.0s)]
*  on the campaign trail. There's even a group of senators who are calling for an investigation of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  whether any taxpayer dollars were used for this Zelensky's trip. This is really faux outrage. And [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=395.2s)]
*  I really have to defer to Tom Tillis, who actually was responding to complaints they're also making, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=401.2s)]
*  because Zelensky's been quite dismissive of Vance's really dismissive attitude towards Zelensky in the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=407.52s)]
*  war in Ukraine. And Tillis said, keep in mind that Tom Tillis is a Republican senator from North [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=413.52s)]
*  Carolina, another swing state. Tillis said, President Zelensky is trying to do everything [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  he can to secure the support for sustained successful effort against Putin. And my guess [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=423.76s)]
*  is if we were in similar circumstances, we'd do the same thing. So if anyone thinks that foreign [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  policy does not play a role in the US presidential race, well, look no further than the events of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=434.24s)]
*  this week. There's certainly other things that are going to come up. And by the way, said VB candidate [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  Vance will be debating next week among the week ahead things to be aware of. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=443.36s)]
*  AMT – Your reasonable people can have a debate about what American interests are. I think there's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  no doubt for anyone who listens to this podcast where I stand, and I suspect you stand, Bob, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  on the importance of this fight in Ukraine. But this isn't a reasonable debate. This is a debate [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  about who are you supporting in a swing state because you went to an ammunition plant in [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=461.76s)]
*  Scranton, Pennsylvania. And it all looks really quite silly in the face of the future of Ukraine [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=465.52s)]
*  and really the future of NATO and the Western Alliance. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=471.36s)]
*  BF – We should point out that another very hot front is getting hotter in the Middle East [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  as a consequence of the United States, and that's the Israeli campaign against Hezbollah now [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=479.28s)]
*  reaching its worst stage since the 2006 war between the two sides. As we were taping this [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=484.08s)]
*  podcast, there seemed to be a proposal being considered for a ceasefire, but it's not clear [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=489.12s)]
*  whether or not we're going to be coming back to tape this podcast with that full-fledged war or [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=495.12s)]
*  with that somehow stalled. AMT – Yeah, and Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  is on his way to the United States right now. He had delayed his arrival. I'm going to give a [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=502.88s)]
*  speech in front of the UN General Assembly right now. I think it's going to be on Friday, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=507.52s)]
*  and I don't know who else is going to be meeting with him. We're hearing very mixed things out of [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=511.76s)]
*  Israel. The Americans and the French have been scrambling to get a ceasefire proposal out. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=516.24s)]
*  Israelis are sending messages. Not only are they not interested in a ceasefire, but there's some [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=520.4s)]
*  suggestions from the Army Chief of Staff that they're preparing potentially a ground invasion. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=525.04s)]
*  I think we're in this very fluid situation. We don't know exactly what is happening. We'll [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=528.88s)]
*  have to listen very closely to what Netanyahu has to say. And let's just hope this doesn't [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=532.4s)]
*  get even further into the American campaign. We all know that it has been already deeply politicized, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=538.08s)]
*  and let's hope that that ceasefire proposal moves forward and that we can get back on track on some [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=543.6s)]
*  sort of ceasefire for hostages deal in Gaza. I'll just have to watch this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=548.72s)]
*  Bob, let's move our conversation to Japan. Tomorrow, September 27th, Japan's ruling party, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=552.4s)]
*  the Liberal Democratic Party or the LDP, will elect a new leader. And since they hold the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=557.92s)]
*  parliamentary majority, don't they? It seems like they always hold the majority. Whoever is chosen [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=562.96s)]
*  will be the new prime minister until general elections. And in August, Prime Minister Kishida [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=567.6s)]
*  Fumio announced that he would not run for reelection. He has called for a fresh face to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=573.0400000000001s)]
*  lead after the LDP's year of scandals and so far not very successful efforts to revive Japan's [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=577.6s)]
*  stagnant economy. Who do you think this new face is going to be? And is it going to really make a [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=583.52s)]
*  difference? Well, the party has what looks to be its largest ever roster of candidates to choose [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=588.48s)]
*  that face from, Carla. And I should note our colleague Sheila Smith has profiled the nine [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=594.56s)]
*  candidates, including two women, which is a rarity in Japanese politics, on the Asia Unbound blog [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=598.88s)]
*  at CFR.org. As you said, it's an LDP vote. This is the party that by far the dominant post-war [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  party in Japan. So it's not a nationwide vote of Japanese. It's vote of LDP members, a little bit [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=609.5999999999999s)]
*  more than a million. For those counting, it's about less than 1% of the country's eligible voters. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=614.4s)]
*  But this group will be selecting the person to lead the country ahead of the next general election, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=620.08s)]
*  which would be a year away. And so it's an important step. And it's happening, as you say, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  at a time of stagnant economy, a party really mired in scandal, a fundraising scandal that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=629.6s)]
*  just got worse and worse over the year. And Kishida Fumio could not seem to transcend that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  And so it was clear to him the polling was at almost a record lows for his popularity. And so [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  he's moved ahead to call these elections. And October 1st, we will have a new leader, a new [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  cabinet for Japan. It's important on all sorts of fronts, in part because while he might have [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=648.96s)]
*  been mired in scandal and economic problems, Kishida did quite well in terms of navigating [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  foreign policy for Japan. He was very important in steering the country closer in its alliance [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  with the United States and shoring up relations with South Korea, which had been just pretty [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=666.72s)]
*  abysmal for many years due to the legacy of Japan's colonization of Korea at the early part of the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=670.64s)]
*  20th century up through World War II. And so he had done a lot to shore up its power to beef up [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=675.6s)]
*  the country's armed forces. And now we're looking at a race between a number of people who might [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=681.52s)]
*  bring something different to the table on that front. So a fresh face, back to your original [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=685.84s)]
*  question, could be in the form of the person who could be the youngest post-war leader, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=689.84s)]
*  Koizumi Shinjiro. And if that name sounds familiar, he is the son of Koizumi Unichiro, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006 and it was known to be a reformer. Koizumi might still [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=699.12s)]
*  be a little bit too young. He's a little bit certainly less known quantity on foreign policy [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=705.28s)]
*  issues and has spoken in language of reform, but it's not clear whether or not he has enough [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  juice to actually get the full LDP behind him or not or whether he helps support. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=716.16s)]
*  He is among the top three polling right now, the latest polls that have been held in the country. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=720.48s)]
*  Another of those top three is a woman, Takeichi Senei. She would be the first ever woman leader [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=725.12s)]
*  of Japan and has kind of fashioned herself as a bit of an iron lady and very much a nationalist [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=729.92s)]
*  and strong on defense. And she would continue to move to shore up the country's military by all [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=735.5999999999999s)]
*  accounts. The other candidate to keep an eye on is an older candidate, Ishiba Shigeru, who's making [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=742.0s)]
*  his fifth try for the leadership of the LDP. He is seen as a bit of a maverick. At the same time, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=747.12s)]
*  you know, could be someone who picks all the right boxes for Japanese people who seem to be [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  disgusted with the status quo in the country. He's a bit of a populist. He's done a lot of [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=758.1600000000001s)]
*  door-to-door campaigning in the country. He seems to be very well known and has of the three has [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=763.12s)]
*  polled what looks to be the highest in the latest round of major polls coming in. So keep an eye [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=768.0s)]
*  out for those three candidates. And again, two of them, Koizumi Shigeru, Takeichi Senei would be [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=773.6s)]
*  first time ever leaders in terms of youth or gender. Is it all about the economy for the Japanese? Is [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=778.64s)]
*  that what they're going to be choosing their leader on who's most likely to revive the stagnant [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=784.56s)]
*  economy? Or do these debates over how strong should the military be? Should we change the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  constitution about the self-defense force? How much does that fit into it? And how much is sort [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=795.28s)]
*  of the broader question? Things like North Korea, how deeply should we be enmeshed in the US alliance [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=800.4799999999999s)]
*  against China? Where do all these issues that we talk about actually fit into their debates? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=805.52s)]
*  Well, if it was a general election, I think the economy would certainly be front and center [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=810.16s)]
*  among the issues. Again, the scandal was playing out at a time when inflation was [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  raising serious concerns. As you mentioned at the outset, this sort of stagnant nature of the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=819.12s)]
*  economy is a real concern to Japanese. So Koizumi is talking, for example, about encouraging [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=823.12s)]
*  competition among industries that seem to be sort of set in stone in the country and trying to [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=828.4s)]
*  spur economic development and revive the country's economy. While at the same time, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=834.16s)]
*  anybody who steps in is going to be mindful of inflation. But I think when you're talking about [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=839.2s)]
*  the LDP, the party in power, and the direction that Abe Shinzo has taken in terms of beefing up [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=844.24s)]
*  its military in this increasingly dangerous neighborhood, I think you're going to find [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=849.84s)]
*  that that is a paramount issue for this party in power, while at the same time trying to pick [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  somebody who does bring a new set of dynamism to the country. Whether the Ishiba, Shigeru, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=860.08s)]
*  the older of the three main candidates fits that bill, it's hard to see. It could be this combination [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=865.12s)]
*  of his sort of populist flair, shall we say, as well as his seniority that wins the day for him. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=870.64s)]
*  Maybe that's why he continues to poll higher. But I wouldn't count on Koizumi Shinjiro as well. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=876.96s)]
*  And again, his father had a well-known legacy as a reformer. I think he was also dubbed kind of the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=882.0s)]
*  Elvis among some foreign policy leaders because of his charismatic nature as well. So not clear [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=886.96s)]
*  exactly what the zeitgeist is among Japanese LDP, but I do think it's this balance of continuing [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=893.76s)]
*  to move the country in this sort of strong defense mode while trying to move it beyond scandal [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=899.52s)]
*  and steadying the ship economically. Carla, I'm going to keep the conversation [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=905.28s)]
*  economically focused, but talk about tariffs. Oh, good. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=910.0s)]
*  Certainly getting a ton of attention in the US. Tariffs. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=913.28s)]
*  And whenever you mention tariffs, you can't seem to not mention China in the same conversation. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=916.16s)]
*  And that's certainly the case with our next topic. In the coming days, both the United States and [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=921.12s)]
*  Canada will impose 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. There are also other tariffs on things [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=924.5600000000001s)]
*  like batteries and steel and critical minerals. And the European Union is considering imposing [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=931.12s)]
*  tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles as well, although it has postponed that decision. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=936.48s)]
*  China has spoken out unsurprisingly against these tariffs, calling them discriminatory [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=940.96s)]
*  and protectionist. The United States at the same time have been pushing for cleaner cars to cut [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=945.6s)]
*  back on tailpipe pollution and a surfeit of Chinese vehicles that are already ready to go, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=949.52s)]
*  and by many accounts are functioning very well, could solve that problem. But it's entering into [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=954.56s)]
*  a bit of both politics and concern about Chinese dumping perhaps. So what's going on here? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=959.76s)]
*  First of all, we don't actually import any Chinese vehicles. And I think the government [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  would like to keep it that way, and the auto industry would like to keep it that way. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=970.0s)]
*  It isn't that they are against Chinese vehicles. What they are opposing is what they say are China's [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=973.6s)]
*  unfair trade practices. And there's no doubt that the Chinese commit intellectual property theft, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=978.48s)]
*  force technology transfer. No doubt they have high government subsidies and dumping. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=983.6s)]
*  And the US government, and we've heard this certainly much more since the pandemic, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=989.12s)]
*  but they are determined to reduce our dependency on Chinese supply chains in critical industries, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=995.2s)]
*  but in things like autos as well, and develop our own industries. So which shall we say are our own [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1000.72s)]
*  subsidies and now tariff walls? There's been a big change in political attitudes toward tariffs [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1006.56s)]
*  generally, both here and among our allies, driven in good part, but not completely by the rise of [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1012.4s)]
*  China and its unfair trade practices. I'm not updating myself here, but I don't remember this, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1017.5999999999999s)]
*  when in 1993 when Al Gore debated Ross Perot, who was a big champion of tariffs on NAFTA, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1023.52s)]
*  he gave him a framed picture of the authors of the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1029.52s)]
*  which was widely blamed for helping trigger the depression. Tariffs were considered a terrible, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1034.08s)]
*  terrible thing. And even in 2016, when Trump ran for president, most quote, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1038.8s)]
*  mainstream Republicans and Democrats still believed that free trade was far, far better policy. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1043.6799999999998s)]
*  And you mentioned tariffs, people immediately went to, oh my God, you're going to open a trade war. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1049.36s)]
*  These days, the debate has shifted from, are we for or against tariffs to one over who should [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1055.12s)]
*  we be targeting with tariffs and at what levels? Former President Trump is promising 60% across [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1061.04s)]
*  the board tariffs on Chinese imports, sometimes higher, and 10 to 20% tariffs on all other imports. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1067.2s)]
*  Vice President Harris calls tariffs a Trump sales tax, but she also says she's going to [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1074.24s)]
*  protect American industry from unfair Chinese competition and shows no sign so far of committing [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1079.44s)]
*  to lifting the tariffs President Biden is adopting. So these tariffs, which are about to go in effect [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1085.12s)]
*  and they're phased, some now, some a year from now, which cover about $18 billion in products or [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1090.64s)]
*  4% of imports from China are a significant departure for Biden, who has until now sought to, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1096.0s)]
*  I think the term they use is de-risk rather than decouple economic ties and the strategic competition [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1102.48s)]
*  by constraining or banning high-tech exports. We talked a lot about this. We weren't going to [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1108.5600000000002s)]
*  sell them chips, but there wasn't a lot of talk about tariffs until recently. And these tariffs [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1113.2800000000002s)]
*  on EVs and steel, they're not things that we buy a lot from China, some of these other things we do. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1118.16s)]
*  And we add on top of this that on Monday of this week, the US Department of Commerce introduced [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  a new policy to ban Chinese and Russian hardware and software from on-road vehicles. They're [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1129.2s)]
*  describing that as sort of, we don't want them to use the technology to spy as well. The goal here, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1133.3600000000001s)]
*  ultimately, I think really is a mixture of protecting supply chains, but also really [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1139.92s)]
*  to allow our own industry to develop. And I think you could call this protectionism, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1144.56s)]
*  but I think you could also make this supply chain argument for it. Is it going to change [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1149.76s)]
*  the Chinese behavior on the things we don't want them to do? So far, no sign. And we're certainly [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1154.16s)]
*  not the only ones doing it. As you said, Canada, they're going to put this 100% tariff on EVs. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1159.6s)]
*  And while the EU has delayed a vote because of internal disagreements, they have a much stronger, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1165.04s)]
*  immediate reason to do it. The EU Commission has recommended tariffs from anywhere from 17% to 38%. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1169.84s)]
*  And they've seen an enormous growth of Chinese cars in their market, and they're really afraid [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1176.56s)]
*  of a massive dumping that could take place. So there's a great debate inside the EU because [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1181.6799999999998s)]
*  they're afraid of retaliatory tariffs on pork and on cognac and on things of that sort. But [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1186.8s)]
*  they've seen a great growth in the market there. As of June, Chinese EV automakers held 12.4% of [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1193.68s)]
*  the market, up from 10% just a year earlier. So they want to protect the market, but they also [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1200.24s)]
*  want to sell their cars in China. So there's a debate there. But ultimately, it really is [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1205.2s)]
*  about developing our own EVs as well, and perhaps trying to get the Chinese to behave better when [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1210.3200000000002s)]
*  it comes to trade. Yeah, it's a particularly thorny dilemma, let's say, for the reasons you laid out. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1216.0s)]
*  And also, again, getting back to the little bit of a climate discussion, let's take a step back [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1221.2s)]
*  for a moment. These Chinese cars, these aren't yougos that are being brought in at $4,000 a pop, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1225.8400000000001s)]
*  and people are gobbling them up and then they break down. These are considered to be highly [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1231.2s)]
*  efficient, definitely lower priced. And there's a real concern that they could quickly dominate. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1234.96s)]
*  And as Xi Jinping ramps up, continues to double down in his China manufacturing policy, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1240.88s)]
*  there's a real concern that they would just flood the zone with these. And European economy, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1246.64s)]
*  as in the US economy, carmakers matter a great deal, the whole industry. The US is also struggling [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1251.2s)]
*  with its own move to electric vehicles in the first place. I think you're seeing more hybrids [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1257.2800000000002s)]
*  being produced. The country's still having problems with creating an infrastructure for [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1261.2800000000002s)]
*  electric vehicles. And there's no real serious plan in place to get rid of the gas station network [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1266.0s)]
*  around the United States. So there's a whole set of things going on here. And it does get back to [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1270.88s)]
*  this concern about China, this concern about moving too quickly in this direction, but also [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1276.32s)]
*  just giving up an entire industry. And then on top of it is, as you said, this use of tariffs, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  which is on the one hand in a piecemeal way, you could understand the rationale, but the concern [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  and the concern that a lot of economists have is that it just keeps building and it becomes tit for [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1291.12s)]
*  tat. And China could turn around on US agricultural products, for example, and that would have a huge [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1295.04s)]
*  impact because the US sells a lot of, let's say, soybean and corn to China. So it's a tricky moment. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1300.08s)]
*  We'll see how they all handle it in the midst of a political season. Did we say it's a political [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1306.0s)]
*  season? It's a political season. As I come up, there are a lot of trade-offs when it comes to [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1309.6s)]
*  tariffs. And despite what President Trump regularly claims, foreign countries do not pay the price for [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1315.6s)]
*  tariffs. Importers do, and they almost always pass the price onto consumers. And there's a new paper [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1322.32s)]
*  from Peterson Institute for International Economics and says that Trump's proposed 10% across the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1328.88s)]
*  board tariffs and 60% tariff on imports for China, they estimate would cost the average American [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1334.48s)]
*  household around $1,700 a year. There are economists who debate sort of the potential inflationary [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1339.2s)]
*  effects of that. And there's a serious concern, of course, about a wider trade war. That's Al Gore in [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1344.32s)]
*  the Smoot-Hawley framed picture. I mean, Perot slammed it down when he gave it to him. I'm not [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1350.08s)]
*  sure it really worked as a device, but there's historical concerns there that you could really [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1354.16s)]
*  potentially set off a trade war, and especially at a time when the word trade organization doesn't [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1359.76s)]
*  work. There is no appeals process, thanks in part to the United States. And then where we started, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1364.48s)]
*  this is the climate trade-offs. These Chinese EVs, as you said, they seem to work. And we're also [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1369.28s)]
*  talking about batteries and other clean energy products. And they're really competitive in price [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  and in quality. And there is this thing. I mean, if you don't let them in, it's going to take a [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1381.04s)]
*  longer time for us to produce these things. We will get to a point of more sufficiency, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1386.64s)]
*  not complete self-sufficiency. But you don't do it now, and you slow down the transition to a [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1390.96s)]
*  greener economy and to a greener environment. And so there's a lot of trade-offs here, which then [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1397.1200000000001s)]
*  raises the question, is this good economics? Is it sound trade policy? And how much of this, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1402.72s)]
*  of course, is politics as well? It's probably all of the above and probably not great for the [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1407.68s)]
*  environment. Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1412.88s)]
*  And this is a figure that listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1419.2800000000002s)]
*  Instagram story. And they exist to frustrate me. This week, Bob, our audience selected [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1424.24s)]
*  Marxist Desenayaka, Sri Lankan presidency. Who is this president? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1430.88s)]
*  Bob Bollingham So Anura Desenayaka, also known by the acronym [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1435.5200000000002s)]
*  AKD. And that's what we'll use so we don't butcher it going forward. He's a compelling figure. He [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1439.52s)]
*  emerged somewhat surprisingly at the forefront of the presidential vote in the country. He's 55 [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1445.92s)]
*  years old. And he survived the country's really violent past few decades of conflict, of internal [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1451.84s)]
*  conflict. And actually, after an insurrection that began in the late 80s, he actually went underground [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1458.72s)]
*  to avoid further government crackdown. He has apologized for what he called armed conflict, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1464.24s)]
*  which should not have happened. And the introductory politics has emerged again as this figure [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1470.48s)]
*  to try to bring the country out of a severe economic funk. And that's even too light a term [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1477.6s)]
*  to describe what's going on in Sri Lanka. It's in really rough shape economically. It also matters. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1483.28s)]
*  And maybe this is also driving some of the audience voting for the figure of the week [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1489.2s)]
*  because of its place in between India and China and their battle for influence and the reason. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1493.36s)]
*  It's located near one of the busiest global shipping routes. It has a $10 billion debt to [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1499.36s)]
*  China and other creditor nations that has been trying to restructure. And it has been moving [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1505.9199999999998s)]
*  forward with an IMF deal to restructure that. But countries that are in this position typically are [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1510.3999999999999s)]
*  in really weak shape and are kind of over a barrel. So it's an important time. He's called elections [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1514.8s)]
*  for mid-November. His party has barely any representatives in parliament. It's going to [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1520.96s)]
*  be interesting to see whether his ascension to the presidency then brings along a tide of parliamentary [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1525.68s)]
*  support or how he's going to actually govern and move this country forward. So what makes him [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1531.3600000000001s)]
*  a Marxist? Well, he's, I guess he would say he has supported a socialist platform through the years, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1536.0s)]
*  although he's talked about more sort of pragmatic economic issues in recent years. But it's something [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1541.6000000000001s)]
*  that's kind of unique to this region of the world where you have candidates like in places like Nepal, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1547.36s)]
*  for example, as well as Sri Lanka, where they espouse a more socialist form of government and [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1552.9599999999998s)]
*  have spoken out against the capitalist way of running things. I don't know really much beyond [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1559.12s)]
*  that, Carla. And I think you might see him move away from that claim, even though it's the one [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1564.7199999999998s)]
*  that he's been labeled with as he moves forward and tries to consolidate a new leadership in [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1569.12s)]
*  Sri Lanka. But I think we're looking at an anti-corruption candidate who's going to try to [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1574.32s)]
*  both be pragmatic on the business front, try to carefully navigate the China-India relationship [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1580.0s)]
*  and get the country back on some sort of a rational footing and maybe also a more stable [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1585.36s)]
*  social situation. Because as I said, it has been through some really turbulent times. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1590.56s)]
*  Well, I think the term Marxist is sort of quaint. In fact, I think we probably hear it more often [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1594.8799999999999s)]
*  American politics thrown around as an epithet. And the reality out there, I don't think there are a [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1600.48s)]
*  lot of Marxists outside of, I'm not sure there are a lot of Marxists even in communist countries [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1604.88s)]
*  these days, but that's a conversation for a philosophy class. No, I mean, if you study the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1609.28s)]
*  Chinese Communist Party, it'd be very interesting to see who are true believers versus who are [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1614.0s)]
*  enthralled to the power of the communist party structure. But that is a discussion for another [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1618.0s)]
*  day, Carla, maybe in your political science class. And that's our look at the world next week. Here [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7r4OE1d2Is&t=1621.8400000000001s)]
