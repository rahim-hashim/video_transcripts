# Blinken Visits China, May Day Stirs Workers’ Rights Concerns, the U.S. Resumes Ukraine Aid, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE)
*  In the coming week, Secretary of State Blinken wraps his second visit to China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=0.0s)]
*  International Workers Day comes at a time of renewed labor ferment, and the U.S. resumes [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=6.68s)]
*  military aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=10.64s)]
*  It's April 25th, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=12.72s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=27.28s)]
*  And I'm Karl-Anne Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=28.28s)]
*  So Carla, Secretary of State Blinken, as we speak, is wrapping up, I think, the first [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=29.98s)]
*  day of a multi-day trip to China. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=34.82s)]
*  There is an enormous amount on the agenda, but let's kick off with one of the areas of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=37.18s)]
*  great concern. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=41.26s)]
*  The Biden administration has voiced a lot of concern about the role of China in the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  support of Russia in its war with Ukraine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=47.14s)]
*  At the same time, there are tensions mounting over surging Chinese exports, not just with [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=49.46s)]
*  the U.S., but Europe in particular. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=54.14s)]
*  And there are concerns about provocations that China has been making in the South China [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=56.98s)]
*  Sea, especially towards the Philippines, all of which could pose security risks that echo [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  and reverberate beyond the region. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=66.02s)]
*  So Carla, what should we be looking for in this quite packed set of meetings? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=67.78s)]
*  Listen, they're just trying to make sure things don't spin out of control on both sides. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=71.66s)]
*  After some very tense months of no contact following, you remember, Nancy Pelosi's August [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=77.06s)]
*  Taiwan and then there was the February 23th spike balloon shoot down over the U.S., Washington [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=83.02s)]
*  and Beijing have been determined that at least they're going to have regular communications, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=88.58s)]
*  which doesn't guarantee that they're going to be nice communications, but at least they're [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  talking. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=97.78s)]
*  So this is a three-day visit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=98.78s)]
*  It's Tony Blinken's second since June. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=100.42s)]
*  President Biden spoke with China's President Xi by phone earlier this month. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=103.1s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was there a couple of weeks ago. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  It was her second trip since last summer. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=110.14s)]
*  And last week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had a video conference with his counterpart. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=112.26s)]
*  And that was a meeting that the Chinese had long resisted. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=117.7s)]
*  So as they like to say, at least they're talking. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=120.0s)]
*  Even then, reality and politics on both sides keep getting in the way. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=123.3s)]
*  And after Yellen's generally feel-good visit, you remember the press, look, she drinks beer, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=126.86s)]
*  look, she eats things. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=131.58s)]
*  Blinken's there on more of a bad cop mission. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=133.82s)]
*  They rolled out this human rights report before he left. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=136.94s)]
*  The US isn't pulling any punches before this one. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=139.9s)]
*  US officials said all the things you listed, Bob. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=142.66s)]
*  Top of his agenda is calling out China for its increasing support for Russia's defense [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  industries. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=150.16s)]
*  Beijing has not sent weapons, US officials said. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=151.16s)]
*  If you recall, Blinken made a very big deal about this a few months ago warning that the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  Chinese were about to do it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=158.06s)]
*  But it is sending an awful lot. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  It's sending chips, machine tools, other dual-use industrial goods. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=161.38s)]
*  And US officials are warning that if China doesn't back off, it's going to start [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=165.22s)]
*  sanctioning Chinese companies and possibly even Chinese banks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=168.9s)]
*  And that's a pretty tough warning. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=172.1s)]
*  And it's got the G7 to issue a warning as well. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=173.66s)]
*  Blinken's also expected to, as they say, raise concerns about Chinese ships harassing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=177.26s)]
*  neighboring vessels in the South China Sea. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  The Philippines in particular is really complaining a lot that their ships are getting water cannon [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=184.3s)]
*  and lasered and all of that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=190.46s)]
*  He's going to reinforce Janet Yellen's and the European concerns that the Chinese are [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=192.86s)]
*  basically rebuilding what had been a very slowing economy by flooding the world markets [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=197.74s)]
*  with cheap exports, solar panels, electric vehicles. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=202.9s)]
*  This is a campaign season in the US and protectionism are us. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=207.5s)]
*  Biden talked about raising tariffs on US steel imports from China last week during a campaign [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=211.34s)]
*  rally. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  This is a favorite topic of former President Trump, so this may only go downhill on both [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=217.38000000000002s)]
*  sides. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  So Tony Blinken may warn of this and the Chinese may push back pretty hard on it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=222.66s)]
*  So for the Chinese, top of mind is likely going to be that foreign aid supplemental [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=228.26s)]
*  that Biden signed into law just as Blinken was about to arrive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=232.42s)]
*  We've all been so focused on the Ukraine aid and we're going to talk about that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=236.54s)]
*  But there's $8.1 billion in that package for Indo-Pacific and about a quarter of that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=240.06s)]
*  is for military hardware for Taiwan. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=245.5s)]
*  This is a particular irritant right now because Taiwan is due to get a new president that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=248.62s)]
*  Beijing sees as a supporter of independence. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  So this is not a great time for them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=255.06s)]
*  It's never a great time to talk about military aid to Taiwan, but it's a particularly [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=256.74s)]
*  neuralgic time for the Chinese. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=260.62s)]
*  And as part of the political deal to get the Ukraine aid through, Congress also passed [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  legislation demanding TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, sell off the app or be banned from [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=266.94s)]
*  operating in the United States. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=272.14s)]
*  And President Biden said he's going to sign the legislation, so that's another neuralgic [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=274.38s)]
*  issue for them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=277.62s)]
*  And while the U.S. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=279.3s)]
*  races concerns about Chinese aggressive behavior on the South China Sea, the Chinese increasingly [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=280.38s)]
*  see the U.S. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=284.7s)]
*  trying to encircle them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=285.3s)]
*  And if you remember, Biden had that meeting with the Japanese and the Philippine president [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=286.5s)]
*  very recently at the White House. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=291.53999999999996s)]
*  So the Chinese have a lot to complain about as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=292.94s)]
*  So I think it's meetings. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=294.94s)]
*  You know, Carla, in the midst of all of that, I'm also thinking back to the what now seems [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=296.94s)]
*  like a very remote period, which is only late last fall, the Biden-Xi summit. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  And one of the takeaways that people were touting as a positive was like, oh, we're [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=307.38s)]
*  ready to talk again and cooperate on potentially limiting the fentanyl supplies because China [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  is a crucial supplier of the precursor chemicals for fentanyl, which is having an incredibly [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=316.26s)]
*  alarming lethal role right now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=321.06s)]
*  And the death numbers continue to go up in the U.S. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=322.3s)]
*  If all these other things weren't going on, one would say, great, we can spend some time [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=324.38s)]
*  on an issue that could actually save some lives. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=329.54s)]
*  But it just seems like an issue like that gets crowded out while you're talking about [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=331.26s)]
*  making sure there's signaling in place so that there's not a mishap in, you know, South [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=335.38s)]
*  China Sea, East China Sea over Russia, Ukraine, as well as a trade war. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  It just seems like the issues are so epic. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=344.74s)]
*  And as you say, it's just maybe like managing this as opposed to trying to solve anything [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=346.46s)]
*  at this point. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=350.94s)]
*  I mean, I think fentanyl has to come up, not least because it's so awful and so many [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=351.94s)]
*  people are dying of it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=356.62s)]
*  The U.S. says that the Chinese are trying to make progress on limiting the precursors. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=357.82s)]
*  But at the same time, the Congress, of course, has been making a very big deal about it and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=364.26s)]
*  saying that the Chinese are doing absolutely no good at all. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=368.3s)]
*  So if Tony didn't mention it, you can imagine how nuts the House would go. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=370.86s)]
*  Would this be front and center for them right now? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=376.94s)]
*  Probably not because they have so much else on the list, but politically, it's absolutely [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=379.09999999999997s)]
*  essential and the number of deaths is obviously intolerable. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=382.18s)]
*  So certainly it's going to come up and certainly will come up in the readouts. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=386.18s)]
*  It's quite interesting. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  They may have slightly more cordial conversations on one topic, which is the Middle East. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=392.42s)]
*  Blinken and his counterpart, Wang Yi, have spoken six times since the outbreak of the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=397.22s)]
*  Gaza War on the 7th of October about the situation in the region. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=401.98s)]
*  Certainly not on the same side when it comes to Israel. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=406.02000000000004s)]
*  But both the U.S. and China urged restraint on their respective partners on the Israel [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=409.74s)]
*  and Iran back and forth because the Chinese certainly are very concerned about disrupting [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=413.82000000000005s)]
*  shipping in the region, keeping the world economy going itself. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=419.94s)]
*  And so there was very interesting sense of fiduciary responsibility there, shared great [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=424.06s)]
*  power responsibility. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=430.02s)]
*  So maybe they can find some shared areas to talk as well, urging the Chinese to become [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  responsible stakeholders as a long time ago we used to talk about the Chinese that way. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=437.17999999999995s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned that, actually, because China had been playing kind of an intriguing [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=442.78s)]
*  role, raising its profile there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=446.82s)]
*  They brokered that kind of a rap push between the Saudis and the Iranians not too long ago. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=448.7s)]
*  But they're also a crucial now market for Iranian oil, you know, as the U.S. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=453.62s)]
*  and as the Biden administration faces pressure to do more to try to block the Iranian regime [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=459.14s)]
*  from getting any revenues from being able to function. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=464.7s)]
*  There's pressure to really close off the oil spigots. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=467.9s)]
*  But it just seems like that's just not nonstarter. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=470.53999999999996s)]
*  And China has a lot to say there. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=473.02s)]
*  And that's always the balancing issue here, which is if you want the Chinese to cooperate [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=475.3s)]
*  and you need the Chinese economy not to go south for the sake of the global economy, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=481.58s)]
*  how much do you push them, whether it's on oil or sanctioning them on supporting the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=486.18s)]
*  Russian defense industrial base? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=491.34000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=493.42s)]
*  Ambassador to NATO gave an interview saying that the Russian military wouldn't be in the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=494.1s)]
*  condition that it's in right now if it weren't for the support of the Chinese. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=498.5s)]
*  And it's defense industrial base. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=503.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's just utterly unacceptable what the Chinese are doing. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=505.85999999999996s)]
*  They're not sending weapons, which was the ultimate of the red lines. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=509.14s)]
*  But they're pretty close to the red line there. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=513.14s)]
*  Russians would not be doing as well as they are in Ukraine if it weren't for the support [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=515.26s)]
*  of the Chinese, all the chips and everything else they're sending there. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=519.66s)]
*  So how they pressure them, we'll see. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=522.62s)]
*  Will they make any progress there? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=525.5799999999999s)]
*  Really worth watching. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=527.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=528.5799999999999s)]
*  Bob, May 1st, pretty much everywhere but in the U.S. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=529.74s)]
*  is International Workers Day. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  And last year's May Day saw workers in many countries protesting unfair [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=534.62s)]
*  conditions and low wages. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=538.18s)]
*  In the U.S., we've seen a revival of union power, most recently at a Volkswagen plant [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=540.38s)]
*  in Tennessee, and that's a right to work state, where almost three quarters of the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=544.02s)]
*  5,500 workers voted to join the UAW. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=547.5799999999999s)]
*  What's the state of labor rights around the globe this year? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=551.14s)]
*  And are we going to see a lot of workers back in the streets? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=553.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of the things that makes this year's May Day particularly interesting [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=556.58s)]
*  to watch, given what 2023 was, not just in the U.S., but particularly in the U.S. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=560.74s)]
*  in terms of labor rights, labor activity. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=565.9000000000001s)]
*  Based on your starting comment, it's worth kind of noting the role of May Day. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=569.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, interestingly enough, it was kicked off by a major protest in the United States, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  the famous hay market rallies, which were bloodily suppressed. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=577.58s)]
*  And they were all about the eight-hour workday. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  You know, imagine that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=583.3000000000001s)]
*  In the late 1800s. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=584.86s)]
*  And that triggered a kind of global sense that there needs to be workers' rights. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=586.54s)]
*  And there was this sense of solidarity. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=590.34s)]
*  And these May Day holidays are in many, many places where there are working [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=592.1s)]
*  publics, not just democracies. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=596.26s)]
*  You're going to see a good number of rallies are expected in the Middle East, for [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=598.14s)]
*  example, from Israel to Morocco to Lebanon. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=602.5s)]
*  You might see, as you've seen in the past, an expansion of the workers' rights [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=606.18s)]
*  rallies to be kind of all-purpose rallies. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=610.3s)]
*  In the case of the Middle East ones, you'll probably see demonstrations on [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=612.3000000000001s)]
*  behalf of Gazans, you know, victimized in the war between Israel and Hamas, for [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=615.78s)]
*  example. These May Day events have taken on a different sheen. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=620.3000000000001s)]
*  People of a certain generation, say ours, would recall during the Cold War, the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  May Day demonstrations in Red Square and the parade of Soviet armaments, which [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=628.5s)]
*  took place on a yearly basis. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=633.74s)]
*  That's really cooled off in Russia. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=635.82s)]
*  The former communist bloc is now a place where May Day is also a holiday in many [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=638.4599999999999s)]
*  places. And yes, it'll be a sense of dealing with the inequality that seems to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=643.18s)]
*  be virtually everywhere. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=650.5s)]
*  We might see South Korea again, where they've had really severe problems with [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=652.4599999999999s)]
*  wages, like in the health care sector, for example. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=657.3399999999999s)]
*  It's the recent elections there that was an issue that resonated. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=659.3399999999999s)]
*  And it's always been a big holiday in Latin America. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=664.26s)]
*  And in the U.S., you can still get events that crop up, even though Labor Day in [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=667.4200000000001s)]
*  September is the official holiday for workers in the United States. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=671.6600000000001s)]
*  There's all sorts of reasons why the U.S. did not adopt May Day. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=674.82s)]
*  So I think we are going to see, certainly internationally, a robust sense of [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=677.94s)]
*  demonstrations. I think what transpired, especially in the U.S., you mentioned the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=682.9000000000001s)]
*  UAW successes, you had the Screen Guild work stoppage. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=686.3000000000001s)]
*  You had a number of them, actually. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=690.1s)]
*  If you go down the list, it was one of the bigger years for labor activity and labor [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=691.1800000000001s)]
*  gains in the U.S. in terms of contracts that boosted salaries and pay and sort of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=695.74s)]
*  standard of living adjustments. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=700.7800000000001s)]
*  But it's also interesting to note that the actual numbers of labor union [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=702.6600000000001s)]
*  membership have not really changed much in the U.S. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=707.7800000000001s)]
*  At the end of 2023, it remained at around 10 percent. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=710.4200000000001s)]
*  And while there are more union members cropping up among the workforces, it's [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=713.26s)]
*  still those who are actually represented by unions. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=718.3000000000001s)]
*  It's not really moving. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=721.34s)]
*  And public polling, whether it's Pew or Gallup, have shown popularity of unions [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=722.94s)]
*  is rising in the United States, but it's tempered by other issues. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=727.5400000000001s)]
*  In the case of public sector unions, for example, public sector unions gaining [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  wage increases also have a role on public budgets. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=736.4200000000001s)]
*  And so we see certain states in the U.S. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=739.5s)]
*  with severe problems in funding their pensions and in other areas. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=741.3000000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of balancing that has to go on. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=745.0600000000001s)]
*  But I will say that we're entering into a highly charged political season in the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=747.5400000000001s)]
*  U.S. where it's very interesting to see both certainly President Biden, but also [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=751.18s)]
*  former President Trump are both making comments that cater to union workers in a [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=755.3399999999999s)]
*  number of ways. And that's something that's a little bit rare. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=759.3s)]
*  Yes, I know that President Trump during the UAW strike first said that he was [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=762.8599999999999s)]
*  going to go to Detroit and then President Biden did something unprecedented, which [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=767.3s)]
*  is he went and walked the line and President Trump did, of course, go to [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=772.3s)]
*  Detroit, but he went to a non-union shop, which I think maybe sort of missed the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=776.5799999999999s)]
*  point. But the UAWs actually, this is a big win for them. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=780.74s)]
*  I think this is going to be the first unionized plant for Volkswagen in the United [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=784.98s)]
*  States, which is a pretty extraordinary thing. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=789.98s)]
*  And I didn't know those numbers, that the numbers hadn't changed, but certainly the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=792.66s)]
*  perception that unions have in the United States have it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=796.86s)]
*  Now, I will say that when Grover Cleveland, I went and looked up the history as well, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=800.62s)]
*  when Grover Cleveland decided that we were not going to have our Labor Day on May 1st [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=804.86s)]
*  because it was too red, even though it started here. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=809.1s)]
*  You don't think it really translated to Labor Day in the United States. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=812.22s)]
*  I mean, Labor Day in the United States is not like May 1st in other places. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=816.3s)]
*  Labor Day is barbecues. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=819.26s)]
*  Labor Day is you don't wear white after Labor Day. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=820.86s)]
*  It's not the union will make a star. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=823.8199999999999s)]
*  Nobody's singing the Internationale here on Labor Day. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=825.46s)]
*  It's basically a great day for a barbecue. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=828.38s)]
*  Not that same sense. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=832.02s)]
*  And that is probably because of the anti-communist Cold War reaction here, although [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=833.1s)]
*  Grover Cleveland predates that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=838.54s)]
*  I think that definitely had a role. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=840.66s)]
*  It's also worth mentioning, you know, as we get into the popularity of unions [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=842.26s)]
*  versus the broader support for workers, who doesn't support workers at the end of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=847.1s)]
*  the day, but the union part of it continues to be sometimes problematic. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=850.34s)]
*  I mean, again, going back to the Cold War period, it was the famous campaigning [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=853.6999999999999s)]
*  that brought Margaret Thatcher to power in the UK, which was busting them, you know, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=858.74s)]
*  the miners and the famous slogan, you know, labor isn't working. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=862.42s)]
*  That really resonated with a lot of brides and brought Thatcher in. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=865.5799999999999s)]
*  And she was the union buster. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=869.3s)]
*  Ronald Reagan was a union buster in the 80s as well. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=871.06s)]
*  Oh, that's true. Air traffic controllers, yep. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=873.3399999999999s)]
*  And there was public support for that at the time. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=874.8199999999999s)]
*  You also have this phenomenon of certainly coming out of the COVID period where [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=877.5s)]
*  the labor supply was so sparse that actually wages were keeping up in some areas, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=882.0999999999999s)]
*  certainly in some of the basic service industries, restaurant workers and so [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=886.14s)]
*  forth, you saw wages going up because the scarcity of workers and it didn't require [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=889.06s)]
*  unionization necessarily. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=893.6999999999999s)]
*  So there's an interesting mix of factors going on, all of which is again, going to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=895.4599999999999s)]
*  make this year's media, I think, pretty interesting, not only for the fact of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=899.4599999999999s)]
*  worker demonstrations, but also the extent to which other issues such as what's [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=903.1s)]
*  going on in the Middle East, you know, tend to seize the stage a little bit. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=908.06s)]
*  Middle East. It's certainly not a place I would be predicting. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=911.86s)]
*  There would be a lot of labor organizing. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=915.74s)]
*  There's a air of protest floating around, Carla. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=918.66s)]
*  Sometimes it gets infectious and spreads to other things. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=921.02s)]
*  So we shall see. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=923.42s)]
*  We touched on Ukraine aid a little bit. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=925.3399999999999s)]
*  We touched on the Ukraine war a little bit, Carla. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=927.38s)]
*  Let's go more front and center on this because it's been a big week in the U.S. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=929.2199999999999s)]
*  President Biden has, I believe, just signed the $95 billion military assistance [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=932.5s)]
*  package for Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan after, you know, months, maybe up to six [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=936.5799999999999s)]
*  months of delays caused by pretty much inter-Republican squabbling in the House [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=942.62s)]
*  of Representatives. Now, $61 billion of that figure is to go to Ukraine's defense. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=947.74s)]
*  It's supposed to help replenish Ukraine's desperately needed artillery supplies, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=952.7800000000001s)]
*  short and medium range air defense systems. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=957.5s)]
*  It's said that some early shipments have already started to move towards Ukraine [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=959.86s)]
*  that were poised to go over there. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=963.46s)]
*  And there were some reports today, Carla, as we headed into the podcast about, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=965.26s)]
*  the U.S. had already been sending some of the longer range, what we would have [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=968.9000000000001s)]
*  called ATTACMs, to Ukraine as well. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=971.62s)]
*  So how do we see this renewal of USAID changing the situation or maybe freezing [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=974.22s)]
*  the situation on the ground in Ukraine? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=979.22s)]
*  Well, the situation certainly was desperate and is desperate. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=981.1800000000001s)]
*  And we should celebrate the Republican speaker finally doing the right thing. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=986.1s)]
*  But while Congress has dithered, the situation on the ground in Ukraine has [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=990.26s)]
*  gotten worse and worse and the people in Ukraine have paid an enormous price for [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=993.86s)]
*  it. And since December, when the U.S. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=997.98s)]
*  had to cut off nearly all the aid, you recall, you know, they found, because of [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1000.46s)]
*  accounting and shaking the sofa cushions, they did find some money. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1005.26s)]
*  But in that time, Russia has captured more than 360 square kilometers or about [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1009.9s)]
*  139 square miles of territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1014.8199999999999s)]
*  And the Russians have also used that time to build up their stock of weapons, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1020.26s)]
*  turning to Iran and North Korea for supplies. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1023.98s)]
*  And they built, rebuilt their forces. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1026.78s)]
*  And the prediction is they're going to launch a major offensive sometime this [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1028.86s)]
*  spring or summer. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1032.42s)]
*  So this aid, you know, really, really is desperately needed if Ukraine is going to [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1033.86s)]
*  survive. Ukraine's forces in this time, they've [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1037.66s)]
*  shorter fighters, shorter machines, shorter ammunition. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1042.14s)]
*  They've been seriously worn down and seriously worn down in morale as well, feeling [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1045.5400000000002s)]
*  completely abandoned by their main backer. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1050.66s)]
*  And as he signed the bill into law, President Biden said the arms shipments would [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1053.14s)]
*  begin in a few hours. And the Pentagon said on Wednesday that they would [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1056.3000000000002s)]
*  immediately send a billion dollar package. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1059.42s)]
*  I mean, they were just waiting for this. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1061.3000000000002s)]
*  Air defense munitions, stingers, 155 millimeter shells, Javelin anti-tank [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1063.42s)]
*  missiles, longer range missiles were also going all of they didn't announce that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1068.22s)]
*  Some of the stuff went before for this money that was found. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1072.02s)]
*  And the hope also is that the Europeans are not going to lose their own sense of [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1075.8200000000002s)]
*  urgency now that the Americans are back in the game and they're going to keep [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1078.6200000000001s)]
*  digging into their own arsenals in their pockets for more ammunition and weapons, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1081.6200000000001s)]
*  including those Patriot batteries we were talking about last week. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1085.8200000000002s)]
*  $61 billion is a lot of money, but we have to keep in mind that more than 40 [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1089.3000000000002s)]
*  billion of that is going to go to replenish U.S. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1093.94s)]
*  stockpiles that have been nearly emptied over the past two years and also go to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1096.02s)]
*  build additional arms for Ukraine. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1101.02s)]
*  Because let's face it, you know, there's money, there's money from Europe, there's [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1103.6200000000001s)]
*  money from the U.S., but we've got to build up this capacity to keep supplying [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1106.98s)]
*  the Ukrainians and to keep supplying ourselves. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1110.8600000000001s)]
*  So it's not an enormous amount of money, even though it looks like it on paper. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1113.22s)]
*  And the Europeans have to, going to have to keep staying in the game. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1118.02s)]
*  Now, will the balance of power change? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1121.34s)]
*  Yes, they're not going to go under now. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1124.62s)]
*  That's the betting, but it's unlikely to change definitively quickly. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1126.18s)]
*  The goal at this point is to hold the line in 24, not lose any more territory, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1129.62s)]
*  particularly on the Eastern front, shore up defenses around the second largest [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1134.18s)]
*  city of Kharkiv, which we've talked about before. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1138.42s)]
*  People were really afraid they were going to lose this and use the time for the [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1140.46s)]
*  Ukrainians to build back their depleted forces. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1144.82s)]
*  They've lowered the draft age, they've increased penalties for draft dodging. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1147.34s)]
*  And the U.S. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1151.1s)]
*  and the Europeans build up their production capabilities. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1151.7s)]
*  And then if things go well, and there are absolutely no guarantees, but there is, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1154.46s)]
*  I think the Ukrainians are going to be reenergized by this, go back on the [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1158.66s)]
*  offensive in 2025. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1162.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1165.18s)]
*  And I should note, we have a new piece up on our site, an expert brief from our [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1165.34s)]
*  colleague, Max Boot, that kind of compares the, in crucial areas, what the Russians [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1168.38s)]
*  have versus what the Ukrainians have. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1172.46s)]
*  And in particular, he notes ammunition that the Russians just have soared ahead [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1174.46s)]
*  and just sheer volume. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1178.38s)]
*  And part of that is again, you have these Western democracies, you know, kind of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1180.6200000000001s)]
*  hemming and hawing over guns and butter issues still. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1184.8600000000001s)]
*  And the Russians don't have that. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1187.66s)]
*  The Russians basically have quotas now that they're going to produce a certain [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1188.74s)]
*  amount, and then they're getting a big assist from North Korea in some respects, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1192.5s)]
*  certainly ammunition, Iran, certainly in drones, for example. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1196.14s)]
*  And you still have some of the NATO countries struggling a bit. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1199.38s)]
*  You mentioned Patriots, Karl, I saw an estimate somewhere that what Ukraine [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1203.22s)]
*  could really use is something like 23 Patriot systems, you know, which is a lot. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1206.5s)]
*  But again, back to our previous discussion from a previous podcast, seeing what they [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1210.6599999999999s)]
*  saw happen when Iran sought to attack Israel, they would love to be able to [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1214.98s)]
*  envelop their skies with these systems that can really be effective. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1219.74s)]
*  And then they have the summer coming online, supposedly some F-16s that might be [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1224.06s)]
*  able to intercept these so-called glide bombs that have become really devastating [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1228.58s)]
*  as well. So there's just a lot going on. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1232.58s)]
*  And I tend to agree with you. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1234.9399999999998s)]
*  I think that we're looking at just holding the line as opposed to, you know, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1235.9399999999998s)]
*  momentum shift that sends the tide back the other way. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1239.26s)]
*  So the secretary general, NATO said that there will be some F-16s coming, not from [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1242.86s)]
*  the United States. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1247.78s)]
*  Biden is still self deterring on that, but the U.S. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1249.3s)]
*  will be training these pilots. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1251.78s)]
*  But it's coming online really slowly for that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1253.54s)]
*  The Atacams, which we had talked about months ago, Biden did secretly approve to [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1256.62s)]
*  send more than 100 of these longer range missiles and they're hitting inside [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1261.18s)]
*  Crimea. Americans have been very clear. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1267.6200000000001s)]
*  We don't want you hitting inside Russian territory, but Russian control territory. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1269.5s)]
*  But I think when you talked about Iran, that was quite interesting as well. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1274.3000000000002s)]
*  The equipment they're getting from North Korea, the equipment they're getting from [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1278.74s)]
*  Iran, we'll see how good the stuff is. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1283.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, there's certainly a superiority in what NATO has. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1285.3000000000002s)]
*  And if the Ukrainians can be trained to use the superior, I think they'd have a major [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1288.62s)]
*  leg up there. But right now, the Russians are overwhelming, you know, seven to ten [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1292.78s)]
*  times superiority and just dumb stuff they're throwing at them. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1297.34s)]
*  So they're going to have to push back really hard. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1301.82s)]
*  They're going to have to get a lot more troops back into the Ukrainian forces. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1304.26s)]
*  And the U.S. and the Europeans are going to have to stay the course. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1308.1399999999999s)]
*  And then you've got the question of the American election. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1311.22s)]
*  So no guarantees here, but they got another chance here. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1313.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's all we can say. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1317.46s)]
*  It is worth stressing the issue of the troops as well. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1319.38s)]
*  Like you've had the Ukrainian force that is just exhausted and has not been replenished [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1322.2600000000002s)]
*  in great degree recently, whereas Russia has now seemed to have developed the capability [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1327.22s)]
*  to bring on new recruits. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1331.7s)]
*  They've still been sort of treating them as cannon fodder, but they have the potential [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1333.46s)]
*  to bring more into the arena of battle. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1336.7s)]
*  So one would be looking for this infusion of new certainly material and capability [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1339.3400000000001s)]
*  to maybe jazz up the Ukrainian side to bring more fighters into the fray, as dangerous [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1345.02s)]
*  as that's still going to be. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1350.06s)]
*  But in the end of the day, of course, we've been reading story after story about how [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1351.58s)]
*  demoralized the Ukrainians are because they felt abandoned. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1355.58s)]
*  One would hope that knowing that the Americans are back supporting them, they are fighting [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1358.26s)]
*  for their own country. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1363.94s)]
*  And let us never underestimate the commitment that people feel when they're fighting for [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1365.1399999999999s)]
*  their own country. So let's hope that we stay with it. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1369.58s)]
*  So, Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1372.98s)]
*  And this is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1378.46s)]
*  org's Instagram story. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1382.7s)]
*  And this week, Bob, another happy number. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1384.42s)]
*  Our audience selected global military spending increases by 7 percent. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1386.74s)]
*  It's not a surprise that the war in Ukraine has led to a spike in defense budgets in Europe [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1391.58s)]
*  and the United States. But I understand that for the first time since 2009, the numbers [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1395.82s)]
*  are up all over the globe. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1399.78s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1401.46s)]
*  Yes. So, first of all, we should note the source of this, which is the highly respected [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1403.22s)]
*  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute or the acronym SIPRI. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1407.0600000000002s)]
*  They have a closely watched report they put out right around this time in the year every [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1411.5s)]
*  year. And these numbers have been ticking up every year, but they have not ticked up [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1414.5s)]
*  this amount, as you say, in 15 years. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1417.7800000000002s)]
*  The war in Ukraine, definitely a role. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1420.5s)]
*  And in fact, it's the majority of the spending is coming from United States, Russia [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1422.22s)]
*  and China, United States and Russia for reasons that we've already touched on a bit. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1427.22s)]
*  There's the background to those upticks and that will continue based on the recent [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1431.22s)]
*  developments that we've just been talking about. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1436.02s)]
*  China is continuing to ramp up its spending. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1438.1000000000001s)]
*  It's spent almost 300 billion dollars in 2023. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1440.54s)]
*  That's up 6 percent from 2022. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1443.98s)]
*  And according to SIPRI, the 29th straight year on year rise in China's military [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1447.42s)]
*  expenditures. So there's a trend line for you. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1453.42s)]
*  That's very clear. And this is happening at a time for, again, what you cited earlier, for [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1455.3799999999999s)]
*  reasons where the neighborhood is getting testy. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1459.74s)]
*  Japan is allocating a lot more. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1462.62s)]
*  It allocated 50 billion to its military in 2023. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1464.3s)]
*  That's 11 percent more than 2022. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1467.1s)]
*  And Taiwan also increased its spending by 11 percent in 2023. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1469.78s)]
*  It's at 16 billion. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1474.82s)]
*  So you have the Asia Theater and Ukraine and Eurasian landmass, shall we say, being [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1476.3s)]
*  chief areas. And then you have, you know, there's fighting going on and there is [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1481.74s)]
*  supplying going on in various other places, too. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1486.3s)]
*  And we can just tick it off, whether it's Africa or Myanmar or what have you, Carla. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1489.1000000000001s)]
*  So it is a sign of this state of the planet right now. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1493.26s)]
*  And the question is, you know, where is this money going and where can it be put [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1497.02s)]
*  the best to use deterrent and otherwise? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1502.8600000000001s)]
*  Not a happy figure. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1505.94s)]
*  We'd like to hope that it was deterrent and defensive. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1507.86s)]
*  We always cheer when NATO spending goes up because we hope that it will be deterrent [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1511.5s)]
*  and defensive and given how destabilized things are since the Russian invasion of [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1518.1399999999999s)]
*  Ukraine. But at the same time, we have to remember that there's certainly a lot [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1521.82s)]
*  better things we could be spending money on than weapons. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1526.06s)]
*  So all told, I don't think that's a happy 7 percent. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1529.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, that's our look at the militarized world next week, Carla. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1533.94s)]
*  Here are some other stories to keep an eye on. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1538.6200000000001s)]
*  This may also marks the 30th anniversary of the end of apartheid in South Africa. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1540.98s)]
*  Togo begins its parliamentary elections and the World Economic Forum holds a [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1545.5800000000002s)]
*  special meeting on global collaboration, growth and energy for development in [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1549.38s)]
*  Riyadh. So there's a there's a happy story right there in Iraq, Carla. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1553.5800000000002s)]
*  Although the end of apartheid is a truly fabulous story. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1556.8200000000002s)]
*  Yes, it is a fabulous story. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGf-SEoXCE&t=1559.5800000000002s)]
