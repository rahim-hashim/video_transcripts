# U.S. Presidential Campaign Picks Up, Iran Mulls Retaliation, Bangladesh’s New Government, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU)
*  In the coming week, diplomacy intensifies to prevent wider war in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. presidential campaigns ramp up with a complete democratic ticket, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=4.8s)]
*  and Bangladesh prepares for a new interim government after its longtime leader fled. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=8.16s)]
*  It's August 8th, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=12.72s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=27.12s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=28.0s)]
*  Carla, let's kick off in the United States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=30.24s)]
*  This week was a big one for the democratic side of the competition for president. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=32.72s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris was certified as the Democratic presidential nominee, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=37.2s)]
*  and she announced her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=41.2s)]
*  Now, governors tend to not have large foreign policy portfolios, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=44.8s)]
*  and as we know, vice presidents don't necessarily come in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=49.68s)]
*  with a major foreign policy portfolio as well. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=53.2s)]
*  However, we are the Council on Foreign Relations, and we like to talk about these things, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=56.0s)]
*  whether it's vice president or president. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=59.44s)]
*  Wait, let's back up here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  We had Al Gore, who took responsibility with Clinton, took responsibility for Russia, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=61.68s)]
*  and Joe Biden with Obama. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  More experience on foreign policy, but please continue. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=68.8s)]
*  No, as has been borne out, and we actually have a backgrounder on this on our site, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=72.4s)]
*  vice presidents actually have stepped up and taken on important initiatives in foreign policy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=76.56s)]
*  But as you get into the campaign, as President Trump said recently, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=81.52s)]
*  the president is the one that matters. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=85.28s)]
*  And so we'll see. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=87.68s)]
*  It got a lot of attention. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=89.28s)]
*  Tim Walz was the leading news cycle figure in a very busy news week at the start of the week. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=90.48s)]
*  What can we say about his foreign policy chops? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, I was thinking about all this, and particularly thinking about this question of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=96.72s)]
*  this commander in chief challenge for presidential candidates themselves typically face. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=100.56s)]
*  Remember Hillary Clinton, that 3 a.m. phone call ad from the 2008 primary? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, it showed that picture of sleeping children with a voice over, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=109.92s)]
*  it's 3 a.m., and the phone is ringing somewhere in the White House. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  And part of that was pushing back against sexism, of course, but even male candidates, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=116.0s)]
*  what Bill Clinton ran as the Arkansas governor, first term Senator Barack Obama ran, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=121.52s)]
*  neither of them had foreign policy credit, and they chose vice presidential candidates [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=126.64s)]
*  with much stronger resumes to bolster their bona fides. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=131.92s)]
*  And Kamala Harris has built her career on domestic policy, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=135.36s)]
*  and then Walz, she got another candidate who was built a career on domestic issues. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=138.4s)]
*  In fact, all of her final candidates for the job, except Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=142.88s)]
*  who spent 25 years in the Navy and flew combat missions in the Gulf War, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=147.04s)]
*  had domestic policy credentials and not foreign policy credentials. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=150.56s)]
*  So what I was asking myself is why haven't we heard more about the commander in chief test? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Although we have been getting on the swift boating about Walz in the last 24 hours, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=159.04s)]
*  but we can talk about that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=162.56s)]
*  So what's the answer? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=164.4s)]
*  Well, nearly four years as vice president, certainly good understudy preparation, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=165.92s)]
*  even if until recently this White House has downplayed Harris's role. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=170.48s)]
*  I was intrigued to read in Fred Kaplan's column in Slate that she has attended almost every one of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  Biden's PDBs, these presidential daily briefs in which a top Intel officer outlines the major [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=178.88s)]
*  threats for the president and other developments around the world. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  But I suspect the main reason why this test hasn't come up either from the chattering class [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=187.28s)]
*  or from US allies is that the anxiety over Trump and getting out of NATO and disrupting [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=192.64s)]
*  alliances and everything else so intense. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=198.96s)]
*  They've seen Kamala so often out there, including at Munich and all the things we've talked about, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=201.68s)]
*  that it's been enough to persuade themselves that the alternative and this by proxy internationalism [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  looks plenty good enough. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=212.56s)]
*  And so who cares if Walz is not a major international player? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=214.32s)]
*  So the commander in chief test hasn't come up that much, which is a long intro to the question [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  you asked me, but one that I've been spending a lot of time thinking about. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=223.36s)]
*  As for what Walz brings to the foreign policy conversation, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=227.04s)]
*  there was no mention of his foreign policy credentials in his rollout, at least that I've [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=230.64s)]
*  heard so far. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=234.72s)]
*  But he isn't a complete neophyte. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=235.84s)]
*  He served in the Armed Services Committee in Congress. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  He was ranking on Veterans Affairs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=240.4s)]
*  He served 24 years in the Army National Guard, although not in combat. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=242.4s)]
*  And as for his policy positions, there was a lot of scrambling going on as soon as he was [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=247.04s)]
*  announced to find him on the record on foreign policy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=251.76s)]
*  But that's not that surprising for a man who's mainly a governor. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=254.24s)]
*  He left the House in 2019. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=257.12s)]
*  And I don't remember having him in especially high profile, certainly not in foreign policy [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=259.12s)]
*  when he was there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=262.88s)]
*  So what did we find? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=264.56s)]
*  Like Harris sees the support of Israel's right of self-defense while criticizing its handling [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=266.0s)]
*  of the war in Gaza. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  He called in March for the United States to push for a ceasefire and hostage release. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=271.68s)]
*  On other issues, he ran originally in Congress, in part on a platform opposing the war in Iraq. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=275.92s)]
*  He traveled to Syria in 2009 on a codel that met with Bashar al-Assad that pushed unsuccessfully [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  to cut off the pipeline of weapons to militants in Iraq where National Guard members from [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=286.88000000000005s)]
*  Minnesota were serving. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  In 2013, he spoke out against Obama airstrikes in Syria. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  He supported the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  I think the things that most importantly, he's a trade skeptic like Biden and Harris, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=300.48s)]
*  although as a governor of an agricultural state, he's been more flexible on that issue. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  And he's very good at environmental issues. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=310.0s)]
*  And I think for US allies, that's going to be a big deal. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=312.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=315.76s)]
*  And I think that extends to his energy policy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=316.0s)]
*  I think he's been bullish on trying to promote electric vehicles, for example. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=317.92s)]
*  As you say, as a governor, he brings those kind of governor credentials of someone who's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=322.32s)]
*  had to make the tough trade-off choices and having a state that produces things that they [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=326.16s)]
*  would like to sell abroad makes them a bit more pragmatic on trade policies too. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=331.04s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  I think immigration is another interesting issue because Minnesota has a lot of people [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=336.8s)]
*  who are either refugees or asylum seekers, Somalis in particular in the state, but also [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  others. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=345.2s)]
*  And he was also outspoken on the Ukraine war, condemning Russia's invasion. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=345.92s)]
*  So he's got a voice. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=350.24s)]
*  We're going to hear a lot more of it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  I think, as you say, very domestically focused, seen as very willing to take on the Trump [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=353.12s)]
*  ticket and challenge them in a number of ways. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=358.48s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see if they do end up coming up with either a first ever Trump [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  Harris debate or a JD Vance and Waltz debate and see what comes out at that time, because [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=364.16s)]
*  you're starting to see some of the veterans type squabbling going on involving his record [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  there vis-a-vis Vance who served in Iraq. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  And I think it was a communication office, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, the swift boating thing is, we'll see how much legs it has. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=380.16s)]
*  I mean, the Cary campaign. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=383.04s)]
*  We should know what swift boating is really quickly for those who might not be totally [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=384.32000000000005s)]
*  familiar with the 2004 campaign. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=388.16s)]
*  Okay. So when Cary ran, and Cary was a swift boat veteran, and some people who served with [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=389.84s)]
*  him falsely claimed he had exaggerated his service in Vietnam. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=395.52s)]
*  They didn't push back. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=399.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, they just let it go. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=400.56s)]
*  They didn't think it was going to be a big deal. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  And the things that were said were not true, but it hurt him. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=403.52s)]
*  And he, of course, had been someone who had served in Vietnam and then had opposed the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=407.52s)]
*  war when he'd come out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  And it had become a very emotional issue for a lot of people who served in Vietnam. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=415.84s)]
*  But the term itself, the verb swift boating, becomes part of the political lexicon. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  And now here's Walls who served 24 years in the National Guard. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  And the accusation is from Vance, for which there appears to be absolutely no substance, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=428.23999999999995s)]
*  is that he left to run for Congress to avoid going to Iraq for deployment. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=434.4s)]
*  And what the record seems to show is that he made the decision to go before they got [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=438.64s)]
*  their orders. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=443.52s)]
*  And so thank you very much. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  But what we know is when he ran for governor, there were several people who surface this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=447.68s)]
*  charge, people who were opposed to him. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  And he opposed the war in Iraq. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=453.76s)]
*  So it got much like with Kerry and Vietnam, that there are these divisions. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=455.28s)]
*  My husband is a swift boat veteran himself. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  And I see this division among the swift boat people. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=462.32s)]
*  I've seen people who opposed the war in Vietnam, people now opposing the war in Iraq. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=464.64s)]
*  You can see how that can get very, very emotional. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=468.24s)]
*  But he, you know, Walls made the decision to run for Congress. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  He ran for Congress in part, as I said, opposing the war in Iraq, drew this, you know, some [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=473.6s)]
*  flak for this when he ran for governor. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=478.32000000000005s)]
*  And then it went away. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=479.68s)]
*  And now Vance has serviced it again. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  So they're using terms like stolen valor. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  They're doing all sorts of other things that are going on. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  I would think that the public, having seen it, I'm not sure it's going to have legs a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=487.12s)]
*  second time around, but they're certainly pushing it really hard. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=491.20000000000005s)]
*  We'll see if it's a one-day story or a two-day story. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=493.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  It's interesting to note that Vance, while having served in Iraq, has also come out as [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=496.0s)]
*  being very outspoken against entangling military involvement for the U.S., whether in the Middle [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=500.48s)]
*  East or elsewhere. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  So, but that's a separate topic for debate. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=506.0s)]
*  I think it is an interesting point. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=508.72s)]
*  And then we, of course, haven't even gotten into, and they haven't even gotten into, you [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  know, President Trump, who was hugely critical of the war in Iraq. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=513.28s)]
*  And, and, you know, I don't like, you know, his criticism of John McCain, who said he [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=516.08s)]
*  wasn't a hero because he got shot down and it was terrible things. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=521.28s)]
*  And his refusal to visit an American World War I cemetery in France and all of that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is a very problematic thing for the Republican ticket itself. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=529.6s)]
*  So JD Vance served, he should be thanked for his service. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=533.6s)]
*  While served, he should be thanked for his service. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=536.88s)]
*  And this sort of nastiness is really not a substance of a campaign. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=538.96s)]
*  I mean, let's move on from it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=542.88s)]
*  Well, Carla, we are going to return to another topic that I think will be a frequent topic on [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=545.2s)]
*  this podcast, which is the Middle East. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=550.08s)]
*  We are in a state of heightened anticipation about Iran's expected retaliation against [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  Israel for the assassination in Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=556.96s)]
*  Leaders and diplomats have been scrambling to avoid a wider regional war. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=560.88s)]
*  Iran insists there's no room for compromise on this front, but there are also reports, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  persistent reports that it also may be reconsidering how it responds. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=569.2s)]
*  Hamas, meanwhile, has named Yahya Sinwar, who is the main architect of the brutal October 7 attacks [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=573.84s)]
*  against Israel as its new top official. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=579.52s)]
*  And Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister, has said Israel is prepared to engage in [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=582.0s)]
*  a multi-front war with Iran. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=586.8s)]
*  So what to think of the diplomacy going on and this anticipation, Carla? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  This is one of the moments when both of us desperately miss daily journalism. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm sure in your case, miss wire service journalism because at least you get to do it hourly. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=598.8s)]
*  We're taping this Thursday morning with no certainty that it won't all be OBE by the time [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=602.7199999999999s)]
*  the podcast drops. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=607.92s)]
*  So with that enormous caveat, we, like everyone else, are waiting to see what Iran does [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=609.8399999999999s)]
*  and predictions on both the when and the how big have swung wildly, as you noted in recent days. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=614.88s)]
*  Iran has warned Israel that it's going to hit back hard for the Honea assassination, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=621.04s)]
*  but also, as it did in April, has signaled that it doesn't want to spark a much wider war. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=626.16s)]
*  Or at least that's what Iran's new, somewhat more reform-minded president, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=630.88s)]
*  Amassoud Pesachin, said earlier this week when he declared that Israel, quote, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=635.2s)]
*  will definitely receive a response for its crimes and insolence. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=639.04s)]
*  But he also said that Iran was not seeking to, quote, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=642.16s)]
*  expand the scope of the war in the region. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  That was his statement. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=647.12s)]
*  Whether the Revolutionary Guard Corps, whether the supreme leader feels that way, who knows? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=648.8s)]
*  Many countries very nervously urge their citizens to leave Lebanon and avoid travel in the region. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=655.04s)]
*  Some airlines cancel flights to Israel and then resume the flights. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=660.24s)]
*  Others have stopped flying to Beirut altogether. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=663.68s)]
*  And over the weekend, Secretary of State Tony Blinken reportedly told his G7 counterparts [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  that an attack on Israel from Iran and Hezbollah was imminent and urged them to use their [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=671.28s)]
*  diplomatic influence not to avoid it but to halt further escalation. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  It seemed so inevitable at that point. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  But yesterday we began hearing, while U.S. officials still expect some Iranian response, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=682.4s)]
*  they began to think it may not be as large as they originally feared, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=687.76s)]
*  and that the Iranians have been talked down either by diplomatic pressure or the U.S. military buildup [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=692.0s)]
*  in the region. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=697.36s)]
*  Or one explanation that I found puzzling but intriguing is the argument that Haneeyat was [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=698.48s)]
*  killed by a bomb, not by a missile, as originally believed, which seems somehow to be a much smaller [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  assault on their sovereignty and a tactic that Iran also uses. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=709.84s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=715.36s)]
*  But I was also, what we're hearing is that even if the Iranians may be rethinking the size of it, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=716.16s)]
*  does that mean that Hezbollah is rethinking what they're going to do? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  We do know that in private Jordan, Qatar, Egypt, and the Saudis have warned Iran [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=725.04s)]
*  to calibrate any response. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=729.68s)]
*  After the humiliation of Haneeyat being murdered, the betting had been that Iran was going to try [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=732.24s)]
*  to inflict a much larger pain than it managed in April. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=736.72s)]
*  They sent 300 drones and missiles. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=740.4s)]
*  The U.S. and its allies managed to push back with the Israelis. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=742.56s)]
*  The U.S. has again moved forces into the region. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=745.92s)]
*  But the feeling was that the Iranians, if they were going to do it bigger, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=748.96s)]
*  could perhaps get through this defense by not just sending its own missiles, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=752.32s)]
*  but also having barrages from this axis of resistance. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=757.6800000000001s)]
*  Things coming from Hezbollah, things coming from the Houthis, things coming from Syria and Iraq. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=761.36s)]
*  So we don't know what's going to happen. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=766.4000000000001s)]
*  Has Iran been persuaded to scale it back? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=768.4000000000001s)]
*  Can Iran control what Hezbollah does? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=771.44s)]
*  And if the Iranians do hit, can the U.S. persuade Bibi to once again [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=774.08s)]
*  cool it in his own response? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  So we'll have to watch. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=781.04s)]
*  Yeah, and I think particularly what you said about Hezbollah is important because [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=782.88s)]
*  it wasn't just Haneeyat who was assassinated. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=786.88s)]
*  The day before, a very senior military commander in Hezbollah was killed in a Beirut suburb, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=788.7199999999999s)]
*  which is another very, very clear warning shot from the Israelis that they can go very high [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=793.52s)]
*  if they have to, to go after the leadership in Hezbollah. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=799.52s)]
*  Hezbollah leader Nasrallah came out with another sort of fire and brimstone speech this week, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=803.28s)]
*  warning about repercussions. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=809.2s)]
*  And so I think where maybe things have tempered a little bit on the Iranian side itself, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=811.2s)]
*  Hezbollah is the place to watch and you're seeing special jitters in the region in and around [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=816.24s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=821.36s)]
*  So I think that's what we should watch. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=822.0s)]
*  And again, as you say, as we tape this, all bets are off. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=823.28s)]
*  Something else could have overtaken our discussion as this podcast drops. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=826.0s)]
*  And we also don't know. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=829.36s)]
*  This is sort of like the Star Trek Prime directive. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=830.64s)]
*  Even when the reports come out that say that the Iranians have been persuaded to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=833.52s)]
*  calibrate their response, how is that going to go down in Tehran? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=837.68s)]
*  Do not underestimate us because this was a huge assault on their sovereignty. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=841.5999999999999s)]
*  So we do know that the US has moved forces into place, that they have put together once again [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  a coalition. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=851.1999999999999s)]
*  How many Arab states are willing to participate in it? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=852.0s)]
*  Not so publicly this time with radar, are the Jordanians still going to be willing to [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=854.8s)]
*  shoot drones down over Jordan? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=859.28s)]
*  We certainly know most of the Arab states don't want to get sucked into a regional war. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=860.8s)]
*  Huge numbers of uncertainties there. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=865.28s)]
*  And then there's the question about the ceasefire talks. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=867.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=869.44s)]
*  The White House is still predicting that there's some sort of a deal is within reach. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=869.76s)]
*  Is this the triumph of hope over experience? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=874.48s)]
*  Are they trying to jolly them along? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=876.88s)]
*  We know that CIA Director Bill Burns and officials from Israel and Qatar and Egypt met again last [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  week and they're trying to move things ahead and pretty much everyone agrees, including [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=884.1600000000001s)]
*  the Israeli military leadership, that Bibi is the main obstacle. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=888.4000000000001s)]
*  But how Hamas is in your face naming of Yahya Sinwar, who is the architect of the October [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=892.32s)]
*  7th attack to succeed Haniya, changes the dynamic isn't clear. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=896.88s)]
*  US officials say that Sinwar always had veto power over any deal, but at least with Haniya [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=901.76s)]
*  there was at least a small voice, some voice for compromise. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=906.56s)]
*  That's now gone. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=909.92s)]
*  And then there's the basic logistical challenge of negotiating with a man who's hiding in [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=911.92s)]
*  tunnels and refuses to use electronic communication. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=915.84s)]
*  And add to that is Bibi going to compromise with a man he describes as dead man walking. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=918.96s)]
*  Certainly an in your face appointment of Sinwar and I really don't know why the White [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  House keeps saying that this is so close to happening. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=931.28s)]
*  than that, the stakes are incredibly high and they certainly have been active and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=933.9200000000001s)]
*  it would like that to be the case. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=937.84s)]
*  But as you say, is it wishful thinking or there's something really going on? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=938.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=942.4s)]
*  Bob, let's move to Dhaka, Bangladesh, where after weeks of bloody protests, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=943.76s)]
*  some 400 plus people reportedly died. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=949.0400000000001s)]
*  Long serving increasingly autocratic Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=952.88s)]
*  basically just ahead of the crowds. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=958.08s)]
*  These protests began after a high court reinstated a quota that reserved more than half of civil [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=960.96s)]
*  service jobs for specific groups, including 30% for the descendants of those who fought [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=966.1600000000001s)]
*  in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=970.96s)]
*  This is a constituency that is largely made up of supporters of Hasina's Awami League party. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=974.8s)]
*  And this is particularly intolerable in a country where youth unemployment is really high [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=980.8s)]
*  and Hasina's repression getting worse and worse and increasingly undermining any [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=984.9599999999999s)]
*  legitimacy that she had left. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=989.5999999999999s)]
*  So what happens now? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=991.52s)]
*  Hasina had ruled the country for what, 15 years? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=992.9599999999999s)]
*  This is a pretty big change. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=995.92s)]
*  It absolutely is. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=998.0799999999999s)]
*  It's extremely breathtaking to watch and potentially in a positive way, the term people [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=999.2s)]
*  power has been used in terms of what's happened with these protests and the dislodging of [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1004.72s)]
*  someone who had been thought to be a very powerful leader. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1009.28s)]
*  First, let's just take a quick note. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1011.76s)]
*  Bangladesh, eighth largest country by population in the world, third largest Islamic country [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1013.2s)]
*  in the world. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1018.48s)]
*  One of the world's factories for what's called fast fashion produces enormous amount of textiles. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1019.44s)]
*  And yet with some deep problems, deep rooted problems that we've seen these protests really [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1025.2s)]
*  bear out. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1029.44s)]
*  As we were taping this podcast, another fluid situation, there was the installation going [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1030.56s)]
*  on of Muhammad Yunus as a head of an interim government, which was agreed on by the current [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1035.44s)]
*  president of Bangladesh, Muhammad Shahabuddin, military leaders and student leaders. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1040.4s)]
*  Then student leaders in particular had said they would not accept a military led government, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1044.88s)]
*  but wanted Muhammad Yunus to lead. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1049.04s)]
*  He is a noble laureate. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1050.96s)]
*  He's well known for establishing what's known as Grameen Bank, a microcredit organization [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1052.64s)]
*  was aimed at lifting the poor from the abject poverty and seen as a real solution and not [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1057.76s)]
*  just Bangladesh, but really worldwide. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1062.64s)]
*  He became almost a global rock star in this way, very well known internationally, had been [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1064.48s)]
*  seen as an opposition figure by Hasina's government and now could be coming back and bringing [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1070.96s)]
*  Bangladesh to some sort of a new era of stability. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1076.64s)]
*  He said as he was returning to the country today, today is a glorious day for us and [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1079.36s)]
*  also referring to it as saying it's as if Bangladesh has got a second independence. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1084.0s)]
*  And then he also called for the restoration of law and order. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1088.56s)]
*  So we'll see what kind of ability he has to bring about that law and order. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1091.12s)]
*  As you said, 400 people killed. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1094.24s)]
*  These were increasingly dangerous and lethal protests that caused the prime minister to [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1095.76s)]
*  leave. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1101.1999999999998s)]
*  There were a lot of people killed. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1101.6s)]
*  Police were killed. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1103.1999999999998s)]
*  Thuggish attacks happening by Omi League supporters in particular. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1104.3999999999999s)]
*  And a country that still can be considered a powder keg, but I think there seems to be [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1108.8000000000002s)]
*  this prevailing mood that they want to bring it into a new era and that Eunice could be [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  this transitional figure that helps to bring that about. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1118.48s)]
*  We'll take it day by day, Carla, but it's certainly a different situation than what [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1121.28s)]
*  we're seeing in Venezuela, another place we talked about recently. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1125.2s)]
*  The protesters wanted Eunice to take over. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1127.92s)]
*  This really isn't actually a legal or constitutional process that's going on here. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1132.24s)]
*  The military is the one that said, okay, you can have them. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1136.96s)]
*  Is the military really going to be pulling the strings? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1140.48s)]
*  Do we have a process actually? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  Is there going to be elections? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1143.9199999999998s)]
*  Is there some constitution behind it that actually makes this a legitimate transition? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1145.28s)]
*  All really good questions. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1149.6s)]
*  The military is, as it so often is in these cases, is really crucial. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1150.8s)]
*  And apparently it was the military that had reached this tipping point and signaled to [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  Hasina as well as members of her family and some others that she needed to lead the country that [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1159.28s)]
*  they were not going to be engaging in a violent crackdown on protesters. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1164.0s)]
*  The military could be in place to back up and support a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1169.6s)]
*  Yes, it currently seems to be outside the bounds of constitutional change, but Hasina's [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1175.76s)]
*  government was re-elected, what was widely seen as a not free and fair vote earlier in the year. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1180.64s)]
*  I think the country is trying to put things back together. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1187.04s)]
*  And that would seem to have to include the main opposition party known as the BNP and headed up [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  by the longtime rival, another legendary woman figure in Bangladesh, Khaled Azizia. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1195.92s)]
*  She was released from house arrest. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1201.04s)]
*  She herself has been urging her followers for, quote, no destruction, revenge or vengeance. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1202.8s)]
*  So she wants to basically help to contribute to democratic national elections. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1208.8s)]
*  So I think the hope is that you're going to see emerge from this process, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1214.16s)]
*  Eunice's installation is relatively quickly some sort of a path towards elections that will be [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1217.68s)]
*  free and fair and where people can feel like they have some sense of agency [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1224.0800000000002s)]
*  and move beyond this kind of corruption, cronyism, thuggishness that was leaving the country. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1228.4s)]
*  It's been a tough half century of independence though, and we'll see if Bangladesh is ready. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  Lots to watch there. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1237.92s)]
*  Bob, time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1239.2s)]
*  And this is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's Instagram story. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1243.2s)]
*  And this week our audience selected 400 arrested in UK anti-immigrant riots. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1251.28s)]
*  Far-right groups using social media and a huge amount of disinformation have been driving the violence. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1258.0s)]
*  And UK science and tech secretary Kyle has been especially critical of X and its owner Elon Musk, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1264.56s)]
*  who tweeted on X that quote, civil war is inevitable in response to the riots. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1270.56s)]
*  Is the UK's new prime minister Keir Starmer getting this under control? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1276.24s)]
*  That is the major question, obviously the first big test for him, worst riots in more than a decade [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1280.56s)]
*  in the UK. We are just taping this after a night in which there were counter protesters who were [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1286.1599999999999s)]
*  trying to change the narrative. So there were bracing for protests to resume again on Wednesday [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1290.72s)]
*  night. They were pretty muted. And then actually the biggest voices that came out were those [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1296.16s)]
*  seeking to protest against the violence, against the anti-immigrant hatred that has come out of this. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1301.28s)]
*  But let's just take a quick note about what spawned this. A truly horrible event occurred in late July. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1306.5600000000002s)]
*  A 17 year old man with a knife killed three girls between the ages of six and nine, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1312.16s)]
*  injured eight other children, two adults at a dance event in a seaside town of Southport, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1317.6000000000001s)]
*  Northern England. Initially the name of the accused assailant was not released under British [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1323.12s)]
*  law. People under 18, they would not release the name. And social media that you were referencing [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1328.8s)]
*  sort of filled the vacuum along with people who in the UK and outside the UK who are from the UK [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1334.56s)]
*  sort of whipping up hatred as well and basically saying it was an immigrant, it was Muslim, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1340.9599999999998s)]
*  it was someone who came in the country by a boat last year. None of which was true. It turned out [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1345.9199999999998s)]
*  and they did release the name of the accused assailant. It was a person born in the UK in [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1350.08s)]
*  Cardiff, Wales of Rwandan background. And still not known exactly what triggered this attack. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1355.4399999999998s)]
*  But that almost became beside the point because these protests had whipped up, which was this [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1362.48s)]
*  sort of percolating hatred of immigrants, of the quote unquote other that has come in. And [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1367.1999999999998s)]
*  to some in England and UK have started to pose this huge threat to life and limb. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1373.28s)]
*  And so it really became this situation that was kind of building on itself. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1379.84s)]
*  Keir Starmer has a background as a public prosecutor, very much had a law and order [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1383.6799999999998s)]
*  response in terms of the sweeping arrests, threatening of jail time and so forth. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1388.08s)]
*  What he's being looked to for now though is a kind of more of the political messaging that the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1392.3999999999999s)]
*  country really needs to kind of overcome this really traumatic period. I think last night's [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1397.12s)]
*  counter protests tapped into some of the concern, the deep concern that many in the UK feel about [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1401.9199999999998s)]
*  just the violence that was happening. I mean, you saw people breaking into hotels that had been [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1407.36s)]
*  temporary lodging for asylum seekers and trying to set them on fire, trying to burn people to death. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1412.1599999999999s)]
*  They actually set on fire a library. And it was a combination of sort of people who are deeply [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1417.04s)]
*  resentful of immigrants, as well as people who were looking to basically just pile on, frankly. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1423.12s)]
*  It's been a real ugly period of time for the country. And Starmer is really on the spot. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1428.9599999999998s)]
*  Again, first big test for him and he's going to be looked to, he's been described as a bland [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1433.44s)]
*  technocratic figure in some ways. He's going to be looked to for some, if not eloquence, at least [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1437.92s)]
*  some consistent messaging that gets the country back on its feet. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1442.8s)]
*  Social media has played such a central role in this. And you're always caught between questions [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1446.64s)]
*  of free speech and the problems of disinformation. And you see how potentially destructive. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1452.64s)]
*  Are they handling that? Do they have new legislation over there? Are they handling [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1461.92s)]
*  it any better than we're handling it? Is there some sort of model there or are they [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1465.6000000000001s)]
*  overstepping our whole notion of the First Amendment? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1469.52s)]
*  It's a really good test of what is still an emerging piece of legislation known as the [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1472.3200000000002s)]
*  Online Safety Act that allows for the prosecution of people who convey information they know to be [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1477.2s)]
*  false, which has certainly happened in this case. And if the information was intended to cause [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1484.0s)]
*  either psychological or physical harm to a likely audience. This act is not in effect yet. It's [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1489.68s)]
*  still sort of going through its implementation phase. And so the government is in this really [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1495.52s)]
*  challenging interim period. It can still go ahead and prosecute people who are trying to incite [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1500.72s)]
*  violence online, but it's not able to sort of employ the full effect of the Online Safety Act. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1505.04s)]
*  The European Union has very vigorous online safety legislation that the UK would have been able to [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1510.96s)]
*  take advantage of had it still been part of the European Union, but it's now sort of facing its [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1516.4s)]
*  own threat here. There is this really difficult exchange, as you cited, between Elon Musk and the [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1522.0800000000002s)]
*  Starmor government. And it must be said that the platform X is really continuing to show consistently. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1527.68s)]
*  It is a not responsible place in these moments. So this is going to be something that is going to [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1535.0400000000002s)]
*  have to be closely watched as well. And that's our look at the turbulent world next week, Carla. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1541.1200000000001s)]
*  Here's some other stories to keep an eye on. Japan's Prime Minister Kishida Fumio visits Uzbekistan, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1546.5600000000002s)]
*  Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. And, and I know you're waiting for this one, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1551.76s)]
*  San Diego Zoo officially welcomes back two new pandas. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8xGunp-zU&t=1555.52s)]
