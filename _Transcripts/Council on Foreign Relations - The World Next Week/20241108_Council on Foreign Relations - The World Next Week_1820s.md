# World Reacts to Trump Win, Israel’s Gaza Aid Deadline Nears, Azerbaijan’s Climate Summit, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU)
*  In the coming week, the world reacts to Donald Trump's presidential win. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel faces a deadline to increase aid to Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=4.0s)]
*  And the annual UN climate change conference COP29 begins in Azerbaijan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=6.88s)]
*  It's November 7th, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=11.36s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=27.28s)]
*  And I'm Karl-Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=28.32s)]
*  Bob, but let's start with what else the results of the US election. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  This week, the world watched as Trump scored a really remarkable comeback [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=35.28s)]
*  to become the 47th president of the United States. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=39.52s)]
*  Foreign leaders and the rest of us have spent the year imagining the consequences [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=42.72s)]
*  for good and ill of the second Trump term. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=46.8s)]
*  Remember the talk in the NATO summit this past July? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  It was all about so-called Trump proofing the alliance, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=52.0s)]
*  though I'm really not sure that's possible. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=54.56s)]
*  So what's the global response so far? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  Now that Trump is on his way back to the White House? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=59.36s)]
*  Well, it's very interesting that there was an already scheduled European [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=61.76s)]
*  summit taking place in Budapest. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=66.08s)]
*  And guess what the favorite place of Trump's exactly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=68.4s)]
*  Well, guess what the topic, one of the primo topics at that summit was this morning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=71.12s)]
*  And that was the Trump election and what it means. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=75.84s)]
*  There were views across the spectrum there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=78.48s)]
*  It could be an interesting quirk that Hungary happens to be the rotating president [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=80.56s)]
*  of the EU at this point, given its leader, Viktor Orban, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=84.88s)]
*  is one of the strongest proponents of Donald Trump, as well as one of the strongest sort [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=87.6s)]
*  of go-betweens, shall we say, between Russia and European countries, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=92.8s)]
*  and famously and proudly illiberal Democrat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=96.8s)]
*  So let's see whether he finds a way of translating, let's say, EU cross-cutting [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=100.08s)]
*  cooperation with the United States in a way that other European leaders might [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=106.0s)]
*  have more difficulty with. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  That could be fanciful. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  It's just an interesting sort of thought exercise. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=111.36s)]
*  But this was a meeting of European Union leaders. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=113.52s)]
*  It was NATO leaders. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=115.44s)]
*  It was other European countries all getting together to talk about the news at hand. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=116.32s)]
*  And there was other news buzzing too, which included the collapse of the German government, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  which was not insignificant given the size and influence of Germany [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=124.24s)]
*  and broader sort of questions about security, about Ukraine security. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  One of the earliest persons to respond to the Trump victory was Ukrainian President Zelensky. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=131.6s)]
*  And he not only ended up talking to the president-elect, but he had a long post on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=138.0s)]
*  X where he congratulated Trump on his, quote, impressive election victory, unquote, and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=142.8s)]
*  talked about the decisive leadership of Trump in the past and his commitment to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  peace through strength and so forth. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  So I say that to say that one of the more interesting responses outside of Europe proper [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  was from Russia, which was quite guarded, quite kind of almost trollish in some of the comments. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=160.4s)]
*  There were various members of the Russian elite who responded in interesting ways. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said he was not aware of any plans by President Putin to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=170.08s)]
*  congratulate Trump in the election. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=175.28s)]
*  He said the United States and Russia were unfriendly and that the United States is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=177.12s)]
*  directly and indirectly involved in a war against Russia. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  And there were other comments along those lines from Russians. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=183.28s)]
*  And so we'll have to see what happens. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=187.28s)]
*  As we speak about Russia, I also thought it would be worth just sort of citing an [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=188.96s)]
*  interesting comment in a new interview published by Foreign Affairs with historian Steven Kotkin. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  He's a famous historian of Russia and he had kind of an interesting take on Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=198.08s)]
*  At one point he says in the interview, quote, it's extremely hard to predict because Trump is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=203.68s)]
*  hard to predict even for himself. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=208.08s)]
*  You could even have Ukraine getting into NATO under Trump, which was never going to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  happen under Biden. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying it's going to happen. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=213.84s)]
*  I'm not saying there's even a high probability, nor am I saying it would be a good thing or a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=215.28s)]
*  bad thing if it happened. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm just saying the idea that Trump is some special gift to our adversaries doesn't wash [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  with me and he may surprise them on alliances and on rebuilding American power. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  It might well cut in multiple directions at once, end quote. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=227.44s)]
*  So that's the school of Trump is his own foreign policy and we're in for an unpredictable ride, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=231.28s)]
*  but not necessarily one that's good or bad, but just different. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=237.76s)]
*  There's all sorts of other takes too, obviously. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=241.12s)]
*  We're going to talk about it a little bit later in this podcast, but climate is clearly an area [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=243.44s)]
*  where you're going to see US policy change abruptly. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=246.88s)]
*  We didn't see a lot of reaction to that respect, although you'll probably see it at the upcoming [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=249.6s)]
*  COP, which again, we'll talk about later. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=253.68s)]
*  But also Trump heard from Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, effusive response about [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=255.6s)]
*  his historic comeback. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=260.48s)]
*  He heard from Asian allies reinforcing the Asian alliances that the US has. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=261.92s)]
*  So the other one that will be interesting to keep on watching is comment from China, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  where leaders there are bracing for a wave of new tariffs from the United States. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=272.96s)]
*  Trump has repeatedly maybe talked about tariffs more than any other issue, foreign or domestic. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=277.52s)]
*  That's the most beautiful word. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=282.32s)]
*  Beautiful tariffs, correct. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=284.88s)]
*  That could be seen as posturing ahead of making some sort of a deal, who knows? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=288.0s)]
*  But Chinese are bracing for a new economic round of hard talk from the United States [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=291.92s)]
*  in a Trump administration. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=296.64s)]
*  The only other thing I'll add is that whether you consider Ukraine or the Middle East, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=297.92s)]
*  there's been a lot of messaging coming out from Trump and from aides about him wanting to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=302.4s)]
*  bring an end to wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=307.76s)]
*  Most experts you talk to will say, nice dream, easier said than done. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  You're not going to be able to just flip a switch and make this happen because you're Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=314.88s)]
*  But he continues to double down on it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=318.72s)]
*  At his victory speech, he talked about him being a president of peace, that he was not [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  about wars. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  And that is among the many other things you can take from the various messages that seem [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=325.04s)]
*  to have garnered support that did seem to resonate with some of his base, which are [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  people who have been very hostile towards the US military deployments of the early 21st [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=333.92s)]
*  century in Iraq and Afghanistan, and see Trump as someone who is going to end American [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=339.84s)]
*  adventurism abroad and make defense strong, but then not have to use it because he's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  projecting so much strength. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=349.84s)]
*  So that's my roundabout wrap up right now, Carla. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=351.44s)]
*  Carla Buehler The big takeaways that I've been getting in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  this is, I suppose three things. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  One is easier said than done because we have seen no Trump policies other than tariffs. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=360.88s)]
*  And even then, he's bit himself up on this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  We started off with 10%, then we talked about 20% across the board, 60% for China. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  At this point, we really don't even know. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=376.8s)]
*  And are we doing tariffs on China because we want the Chinese to stop stealing intellectual [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  property? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=384.56s)]
*  Are we doing them because we want to bring everybody back to the United States? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  We don't even know why tariffs. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=389.44s)]
*  And this whole question about, are you going to punish your friends at the same time you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=391.6s)]
*  punish your adversaries? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=395.6s)]
*  You know, a tariff policy that punishes Europe at the same time it punishes China, you lessen [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=397.52s)]
*  your leverage on China. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=402.64s)]
*  And we saw that in the first Trump term. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=403.52s)]
*  So that's the first thing is that we don't see a plan and we don't see plans on the Middle [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=405.2s)]
*  East. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=409.84s)]
*  We don't see a plan on Ukraine. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=410.08s)]
*  We don't see a plan even on Taiwan versus China itself. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=411.92s)]
*  Trump in the past has said that Taiwan's got to spend more money before we're going [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=416.56s)]
*  to protect them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=419.6s)]
*  He said that about South Korea. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=420.08s)]
*  So people are very confused, not just the analysts like us. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=421.92s)]
*  All these countries are scrambling. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=426.8s)]
*  They're trying to figure out what is Trump want from us because erratic is not really [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=428.24s)]
*  a strategy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=435.44s)]
*  He seems to think it's a strategy, but I think that's one of the big things. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  And the other big takeaway, what you're seeing from the analyst and from some leaders as [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=439.44s)]
*  well, is that Trump is extremely transactional. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  And that also goes back to the what does he want from us because they know what they want [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  from him. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=450.72s)]
*  They don't want him to start a nuclear war. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  They want the United States to continue to provide protection in a good way, not as a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=454.32000000000005s)]
*  protection racket. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  So countries are trying to figure it out. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=460.8s)]
*  And there's finally this one big choice, particularly countries that are in alliances [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=463.12s)]
*  have to make, and this is starting with Europe. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=467.36s)]
*  When Trump was president last time around, he was always trying to cut deals individually [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  with European countries. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=475.04s)]
*  Angela Merkel, we had to cut a deal, a direct Germany-U.S. trade deal. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=476.88000000000005s)]
*  And she kept saying, I'm part of a trade bloc here. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=481.92s)]
*  Countries in Europe are going to have to make a decision, which is do we try to mollify Trump [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=485.12s)]
*  individually or do we hold together with a security pact? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=490.64000000000004s)]
*  Do we hold together with our trade deals? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  Do we hold together or not? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  And we don't know yet which way it's going to go. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=497.20000000000005s)]
*  It's will Europe be stronger because of the United States is going to pull back or will [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  it break the block apart? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=504.48s)]
*  So we're going to have to watch for all of those things. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=505.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=507.2s)]
*  And following up on a few of those, Carla, the, you know, where's the plan approach? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=508.0s)]
*  I think one example of that in the negative is, you know, remember all the hoopla around [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=512.24s)]
*  unprecedented U.S.-North Korean symmetry and talks. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=518.4s)]
*  It was an extraordinary thing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=521.28s)]
*  It was U.S. and North Korean leaders meeting, saying nice things. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=522.64s)]
*  With no planning at all from the administration beforehand. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=526.48s)]
*  There was no planning. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=529.04s)]
*  And at the end of the day, there was no result. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=530.0s)]
*  It created a pause in what had been a very tense period of time that included rhetoric [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=532.1600000000001s)]
*  between the two sides, but real ramping up in the North Korean side. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=537.44s)]
*  I buttoned the speaker then asked you. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=540.32s)]
*  Rocket man claims and things like that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  And it was nice to see a pause. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=544.24s)]
*  It was nice to see potentially a movement towards what seemingly the sides wanted, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=545.6s)]
*  which was a de-escalation and potentially a demilitarization of the peninsula. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=550.48s)]
*  But you had North Korean experts saying where is the roadmap here? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=554.4000000000001s)]
*  And there really wasn't ended up being about the fact of this being able to pull off a meeting, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=558.32s)]
*  but no, they're there. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=563.36s)]
*  So that's one thing to keep an eye on as we look ahead and whether there was [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=564.4000000000001s)]
*  learnings from that process or not. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=567.5200000000001s)]
*  The other thing on the on the terrorist front is going to be important to watch. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=570.1600000000001s)]
*  And you had a lot of interesting pieces from economic focus publications since the election [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=572.6400000000001s)]
*  is, you know, tariffs tend to create a straight line to inflation because, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=578.08s)]
*  you know, not only are they putting up walls against other countries trade, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  but they're making things more expensive for American consumers. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  And if there's any issue that resonated more than any other in this election, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=588.16s)]
*  by all accounts, it was inflation that was the stain on the Biden administration that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=591.6s)]
*  affected the Harris campaign. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=596.16s)]
*  And so, you know, if 60% tariffs or whatever levels are suddenly emerging and it's creating [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=598.0s)]
*  huge problems in the grocery and department stores, I think you're going to see a real [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=604.56s)]
*  change in that pretty quickly and maybe a dissembling and movement towards other policies. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=608.0s)]
*  So the speed and the way in which that kind of thing is going to be rolled out will be [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  really worth watching, Carla. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=616.16s)]
*  And as you say, the individual, the focusing on individual nations is no place is more [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  focused on that than the European Union. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=622.88s)]
*  That was definitely some of the messaging coming out of the European Union since the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  election where you had Ursula von der Leyen cautioning that escalating trade tensions [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=627.76s)]
*  would be against both US and European interests. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  That was part of her congratulatory remarks to Trump. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  So watch that issue, watch for the plans and watch for the timing on these things as [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  this transition starts to get underway. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=642.48s)]
*  I know we want to move on to the Middle East and I think this is a good segue because [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=644.32s)]
*  there is one other world leader we haven't talked about for the response and that's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=647.44s)]
*  President Biden. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=650.88s)]
*  He has to make a decision how he's going to spend his remaining two and a half months [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=652.4s)]
*  and what he can do possibly to Trump-proof American policy to preserve his legacy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=656.8s)]
*  And I think the place to watch that we don't know the answer to is, is he going to give [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  more to Ukraine? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=667.12s)]
*  Is he finally going to loosen the restraints on using long range weapons to hit inside [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=668.08s)]
*  of Russia, particularly now the North Korean troops are there? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=672.72s)]
*  Is he going to push out as much military aid before Trump turns the spigot off? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=675.44s)]
*  It's something that we can talk about, I suspect, on the podcast. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=679.52s)]
*  But one more world leader, he said the right things talking about the peaceful transition [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=682.32s)]
*  and making all these commitments, but he's going to make some decisions on his policy [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=691.44s)]
*  And some of that, in past times you've sometimes had that baked into some of the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=692.08s)]
*  presidential transition processes even from party to party. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=697.52s)]
*  Transitions involving Trump are different types of transitions, at least they have been [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=700.9599999999999s)]
*  in the past. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=704.48s)]
*  So we'll have to see how that plays out as well, Carla. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  But let's do shift to the Middle East. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=707.92s)]
*  On October 13th, seems like an era ago, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=709.84s)]
*  Lloyd Austin sent a letter to Israel warning that if it did not significantly improve [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=715.6s)]
*  humanitarian conditions in Gaza by next week, November 12th, it could risk restrictions [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=719.6s)]
*  on US military assistance. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=724.64s)]
*  Earlier this week, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller even announced a fail grade [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=726.64s)]
*  for Israel on improvement in aid deliveries. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=731.2s)]
*  With that deadline now just days away, what's going to happen? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=734.0s)]
*  Well, let's start with why they are getting a failing grade. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=737.76s)]
*  And he did say there's a little bit more time. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=740.96s)]
*  The humanitarian situation in Gaza is really desperate. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=744.24s)]
*  When Blinken and Austin sent the letter, one of their demands was that Israel allow a [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=747.6s)]
*  minimum of 350 aid trucks a day entering Gaza. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=751.68s)]
*  And by the end of October, according to the UN, average was just 71 trucks a day were [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=755.8399999999999s)]
*  getting in. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=760.3199999999999s)]
*  So that's failing, failing, failing, failing. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  It's also a huge concern over the Israeli government's decision to ban UNRWA's work [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=764.64s)]
*  in Gaza at the start of next year. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=769.8399999999999s)]
*  The UN aid agency is the main provider of humanitarian support there. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=771.92s)]
*  Israel accuses UNRWA of being deeply infiltrated by Hamas, a charge for which it has not [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=776.4s)]
*  provided evidence. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=781.44s)]
*  And Blinken and Austin had opposed that move in their letter as well. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=782.72s)]
*  The US is a major funder of UNRWA and that's likely to go away with the return of President [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=786.72s)]
*  Trump. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  But pretty much every humanitarian aid agency, not just the UN, says that there's no other [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=790.96s)]
*  group that has the expertise to do this at a moment of desperation. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  And last weekend, the head of UNICEF, Kathy Russell, who's an American, warned that, quote, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=800.72s)]
*  the entire Palestinian population in North Gaza, especially children, is at imminent [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=804.96s)]
*  risk of dying from disease, famine, and the ongoing bombardments. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=810.24s)]
*  So that's why they're getting a failing grade and it's a desperate circumstance. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=814.32s)]
*  As for what the Biden administration does now, my question and I suspect their question, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=819.52s)]
*  is there anything within reason that a lame duck administration can do that's going to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=824.48s)]
*  change Benjamin Netanyahu's behavior over the next two and a half months? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=828.72s)]
*  As you said, Bob, there are few governments that were more delighted with the Trump win [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=833.36s)]
*  and I don't think there's much they can threaten. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=837.6s)]
*  They're certainly not going to say, we're not going to defend you from Iran. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=841.6800000000001s)]
*  And you just had the defense minister step down in Israel as well, who wasn't in town. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=847.12s)]
*  Well, and Netanyahu is really, even before Trump won, he's not in a compromising mood [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=850.24s)]
*  these days. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=855.52s)]
*  Before the results were in, as you said, he fired his defense minister, Yoav Galant. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  And this is a really risky time to go around firing your defense minister. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=861.52s)]
*  He's fighting a war in Gaza, war in Lebanon, stepping up attacks in Syria, stepping up [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=864.96s)]
*  attacks in the West Bank, could face another retaliatory barrage from Iran. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  And still he went ahead with this. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=874.88s)]
*  This firing brought tens of thousands of Israelis into the streets because Galant is not a dove, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=877.0400000000001s)]
*  but he was seen as very much pushing for a ceasefire for hostages deal. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=881.9200000000001s)]
*  And notably, he was also the interlocutor with the Biden administration. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=887.44s)]
*  He's the guy they always talk to. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=890.88s)]
*  So Netanyahu wasn't interested in compromising before Trump won, and he's certainly not going [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=892.8s)]
*  to be interested in compromising. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=897.52s)]
*  So I don't see what levers they have to get them to open up Gaza. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=899.1999999999999s)]
*  If there's any pressure at all on Netanyahu, it's going to, I think, come from within and [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=904.7199999999999s)]
*  focused on some sort of a ceasefire deal. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=910.88s)]
*  The Israeli public doesn't seem to be demonstrating concern for humanitarian suffering inside [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  of Gaza itself. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=918.3199999999999s)]
*  And so far, these ceasefire negotiations aren't going anywhere. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=919.4399999999999s)]
*  The only other thing I would point to in the unpredictable category, Carla, relates to the [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=922.48s)]
*  election, which is you had certain groups of Palestinian Americans come out for Trump or [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  come out demonstrably not for Harrison voted for, it's like Jill Stein, let's say. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=932.08s)]
*  Or didn't vote at all. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=935.84s)]
*  Or didn't vote at all. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=936.64s)]
*  And some of them did, though, speak for Trump. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=937.5200000000001s)]
*  Some of them were local office holders and things like that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=940.24s)]
*  In the event that they were to message to the president-elect their concern, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=942.32s)]
*  you could see that in some way expediting some action. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=947.52s)]
*  There has been that type of outreach before. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=951.28s)]
*  So that's the only thing I would point to as another outlier. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=954.56s)]
*  Your point is well taken. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=957.3599999999999s)]
*  And I think it is hard to imagine anything major changing, but we live in strange times. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=958.56s)]
*  CAROLINE Well, this goes back to the, you know, what is former president, future president [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump's policy for the Middle East. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=968.16s)]
*  And we don't know. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=969.92s)]
*  This is one of these things that he said that he's going to solve in two minutes. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=970.7199999999999s)]
*  He said in August that he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get your victory [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=975.6s)]
*  because the killing has to stop. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=982.0s)]
*  But he's also fiercely criticized Biden and Harris for calling for a ceasefire. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=984.4s)]
*  So he's been all over the lot on this. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=988.96s)]
*  Will Netanyahu be more willing to compromise if Trump is putting pressure on him? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=992.08s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=996.72s)]
*  But certainly the Netanyahu that we're seeing right now is showing no signs of [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=997.76s)]
*  willing to compromise on any of these conflicts. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1002.4s)]
*  And with Gallant out of it, and certainly the right wing members of his coalition, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1004.9599999999999s)]
*  were just tweeting up a storm and giving speeches in the Knesset and taking huge victory laps [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1010.16s)]
*  because they think that, you know, all the pressure is going to go away. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1015.1999999999999s)]
*  Bob, with that happy thought, let's move north to Baku, Azerbaijan, which is going to host [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1018.8s)]
*  the 29th UN climate change conference starting next Monday. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1025.2s)]
*  And like its predecessors, COP29 is going to focus on reducing emissions, increasing green energy, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1029.5200000000002s)]
*  and climate financing. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1035.5200000000002s)]
*  How successful is this going to be in addressing climate change? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1038.24s)]
*  Azerbaijan is a major oil and gas producer. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1041.5200000000002s)]
*  This is, I bet, the second one of the oil and gas producers to be the host. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1044.48s)]
*  And we have the other factors. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1050.0s)]
*  You know, how is the Trump election going to affect these negotiations? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1051.7600000000002s)]
*  President-elect Trump calls global warming a scam. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1055.2s)]
*  He pulled out of Paris. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1057.68s)]
*  And I think the betting is he's going to pull out again. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1059.2s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1061.28s)]
*  So it's this trend of petro powers hosting climate conferences. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1062.8s)]
*  And it does really cast a pall over this sense of ambition. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1067.6000000000001s)]
*  It was also already going to be more lightly attended, in part because of a scheduling [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1072.0s)]
*  overlap with the upcoming G20, Group of 20, summit taking place in Brazil, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1075.8400000000001s)]
*  which comes like halfway through this conference. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1080.72s)]
*  And Azerbaijan's capacity to host larger delegations and so forth, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1083.44s)]
*  all that adds up to one that might be a more muted affair. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1086.8s)]
*  But the climate has not stopped climating, Carla. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1090.24s)]
*  And we're seeing one extreme set of events after another. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1094.24s)]
*  The latest was the extraordinary flooding that we saw in Valencia, Spain. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1098.3999999999999s)]
*  The pictures almost looked apocalyptic of cars bunched on top of each other. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1102.6399999999999s)]
*  And what happened to people in that torrent? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  Hundreds of people killed. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1109.9199999999998s)]
*  Hundreds of people killed. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1111.04s)]
*  We've talked about the extreme weather that has hit the United States. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1112.6399999999999s)]
*  Helene's heavy dumping of rain, unprecedented dumping of rain almost, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1115.92s)]
*  on parts of North Carolina, for example, and what that did. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1119.6000000000001s)]
*  We're just in a period of ourselves. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1124.0800000000002s)]
*  I think it's on record now as tied for, or we've reached the longest period of no rain [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1126.0s)]
*  in Washington, DC area, 35 days or so. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1130.72s)]
*  All of these are things that are happening with more frequency. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1133.76s)]
*  They're hitting smaller communities larger. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1136.0800000000002s)]
*  And so let's look at what the summit's supposed to accomplish. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1138.16s)]
*  And a little bit of context. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1140.88s)]
*  Cops are supposed to increase the ambition of countries to curb global warming below [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1142.16s)]
*  2.7 degrees Fahrenheit of pre-industrial levels. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1147.68s)]
*  That is a level seen as being able to avoid catastrophic harm to the planet. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1150.88s)]
*  The planet is close to breaching that limit already. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1155.28s)]
*  And countries are going to be trying to, especially the poorer countries, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1158.4s)]
*  communities that are more vulnerable to extreme climate events, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1162.48s)]
*  they're going to be pushing for more ambitious emissions reductions, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  as well as identifying new sources of finance, because the finance can help. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1167.76s)]
*  In these two terms, you're going to hear continuously mitigation and adaptation. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1170.56s)]
*  Mitigation had a move from heavy reliance on fossil fuels to green energies in ways [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1174.56s)]
*  that can help a poorer country that doesn't have the wherewithal to do that. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1180.8s)]
*  And climate finance is seen as a way to help that as well as adaptation, which is [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1184.56s)]
*  buttressing, building up your infrastructure, whether it's moving people away from coastal [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  areas, just really hardening the ways in which structures are built in the first place. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  And being able to withstand everything from extreme flooding to extreme heat, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1199.52s)]
*  and both of which are increasing in frequency. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1204.0s)]
*  There's a lot of money at stake and a lot of money is needed. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1206.8s)]
*  The independent high-level expert group on climate finance two years ago found that [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1209.12s)]
*  developing countries need around one trillion with a T dollars per year by next year, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1212.72s)]
*  and 2.4 trillion by 2030 to meet their climate finance needs. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1218.08s)]
*  They are short of that. The ambition to pony up more could take a big hit with the incoming Trump [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1222.32s)]
*  administration, which has not been a fan of the cop process, which has deeply skeptical of the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1228.16s)]
*  charge of human caused climate change. And as you said, is likely to just yank the United States [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1233.52s)]
*  out of the Paris Accord as well, which is what had given impetus to this climate finance among other [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1237.92s)]
*  goals that had been set up by the international community. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1242.96s)]
*  It doesn't mean that there will be a total stalling or lack of movement though, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1245.6000000000001s)]
*  Karline. I think that's going to be interesting to see. First of all, who attends from the US [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1250.48s)]
*  and what kind of agency they have and Baku, but what other countries are saying about what they're [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1254.72s)]
*  prepared to do regardless. The US is a major emitter, but it's not going to be the major [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1259.92s)]
*  emitter going forward. Climate experts are saying that it's China and emerging economies [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1264.24s)]
*  that are the bigger ones, India in particular. The US also can tap into and continue to tap [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1268.96s)]
*  into technological innovation that has made the purveying of power cheaper. And there's interest [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1274.8s)]
*  in really ramping up power because of the needs of sectors like AI. And one power that has some [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1279.92s)]
*  controversy, but has zero emissions is nuclear power. And you're seeing a lot more interest in [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1286.0800000000002s)]
*  that, including in so-called red states, very pro-Trump states that even during the Trump's [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1289.76s)]
*  first administration ramped up their green energy. So these are interesting dynamics that are playing [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1295.44s)]
*  out that mean that it's not a black and white world as far as this goes, but it's going to be [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1300.48s)]
*  a more challenging world, I think, as we see this next cop, COP 29 play out. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1304.3200000000002s)]
*  And last time when the US pulled out of under the Trump administration, pulled out of Paris, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1309.68s)]
*  people said, don't despair completely because there's a lot of progress going on in the states. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1315.3600000000001s)]
*  Even energy companies are switching, moving away from coal, that there is a positive inertia [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1321.92s)]
*  behind this. But there's also interesting political dynamics are going on here. One of the things the [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1327.52s)]
*  Republicans have vowed to do is to repeal this IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, which has nearly [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1332.96s)]
*  $400 billion in green projects, which have been excoriated by many Republican politicians. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1338.16s)]
*  But an enormous amount of that money is going to red states. And so we will see that'll be a really [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1345.28s)]
*  early test of a political commitment that was made that is not going to be kept because people [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1350.3200000000002s)]
*  are seeing the real value of it on the ground. So there's some positive things there that are [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1355.1200000000001s)]
*  probably going to continue to go on whether or not the US is inside the Paris Accord, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1361.44s)]
*  but it's a race against time. And I don't think even the US, which is making an enormous amount [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1366.3200000000002s)]
*  of progress, is going to make this. What are we supposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1372.24s)]
*  by 2030? I don't think even the United States is going to meet that. I think we're going to be, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1378.0s)]
*  what, at 40% by 2030? Yeah, that's right. The goals are just kind of achingly slow. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1382.24s)]
*  And despite the clear ramp up wherever you live, blue state, red state, wherever, purple state, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1388.8s)]
*  it just is not a breakthrough issue. Florida seemingly would need to get hit by 20 powerful [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1394.72s)]
*  hurricanes a year before the increasingly red governorship of that state would take up and [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1399.76s)]
*  call a spade a spade, although you are seeing money going to adaptation and not so much mitigation [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1405.76s)]
*  but adaptation. So it's going to be hard to see that argument prevailing. As you say, as the clock [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1411.1999999999998s)]
*  is ticking and global warming is accrued, and you could tomorrow have an incredible breathtaking [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1417.12s)]
*  commitment towards mitigation efforts, and still what's built up in the atmosphere is troubling [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1422.64s)]
*  enough that there will be consequences as the world needs to adjust and move on. But there are [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1428.0s)]
*  these cross-cutting elements, as you say. And President-elect Trump has been very strong in [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1433.92s)]
*  saying he wants to go tap into what he's called the liquid gold of the vast US fossil fuel [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1439.5200000000002s)]
*  resources. But there was tepid interest in that even during his first administration [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1444.88s)]
*  among oil companies, even bidding on Alaskan fields, for example. So it's going to be very [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1449.04s)]
*  interesting to see how much the industry sources take them up on that. And people like Elon Musk, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1454.0s)]
*  who's Tesla, he does not run on fossil fuels, whether or not that triggers a move in another [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1458.8799999999999s)]
*  direction that we're not seeing right now. But the signs are that there's going to be a chilling, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1463.92s)]
*  pardon the expression, and climate policy for the US, at least in the near future. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1467.92s)]
*  Temperatures go up, they go down. Indeed. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1472.0s)]
*  As the soon to be president would say. Well, Carla, we've talked our way into [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1474.96s)]
*  the audience figure of the week portion of the podcast. This is where listeners vote every [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1478.64s)]
*  Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's Instagram story. And the choice this week also [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1484.3200000000002s)]
*  had to do an election in Moldova, of all places. The figure was pro-West President Sandhu re-elected [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1489.44s)]
*  in Moldova. So Maya Sandhu, what does it mean for her to continue in her role? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1495.92s)]
*  Well, first, I want to thank our listeners for choosing the rare topic these days with a happy [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1500.64s)]
*  outcome and an election topic with a happy outcome. So thank you. And this race was actually a runoff [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1505.52s)]
*  and it drew a lot of attention and anxiety because while sitting president Maya Sandhu [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1511.84s)]
*  finished ahead in a field of 11 candidates in the first round of elections last month, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1516.6399999999999s)]
*  which we actually talked about on the podcast, a referendum at the same time last month championed [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1520.56s)]
*  by Sandhu on whether to amend their constitution to commit to future EU membership passed, but only [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1526.24s)]
*  by a shockingly low margin of 50.39%. And everybody was really surprised because the polls said they [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1533.28s)]
*  were going to do fabulously well on this. And so it just barely eeked out. And adding to the anxiety [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1539.92s)]
*  in the second round Moldova vote, it just came just a week after the pro-Moscow Georgian Dream [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1545.84s)]
*  Party triumphed in a hotly contested election in Georgia. And the Russians were accused by the EU [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1551.28s)]
*  and pretty much everybody else of aggressively meddling in both the Georgian and the Moldovan [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1557.44s)]
*  vote. And one of the favorite themes of their misinformation efforts in both places was you lean [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1561.6s)]
*  too far west, you end up like Ukraine. So a lot of people said that this was not a fair election in [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1567.52s)]
*  Georgia, but it certainly went pro-Moscow in Georgia. And the fear was that it wasn't going [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1574.24s)]
*  to turn out well in Moldova. But despite all the fears, Sandhu won handily with 54.9% of the vote [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1578.3999999999999s)]
*  against 45.3 for Alexander Soyanlu. I'm probably pronouncing that wrong. He's a former prosecutor [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1585.12s)]
*  who she fired because he was under criminal investigation for corruption. He denied he was [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1593.36s)]
*  what she kept calling him Moscow's man, but investigative journalists in Moldova reported [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1598.8s)]
*  that his candidacy was backed by this elaborate $30 million plus vote buying operation, which is [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1604.1599999999999s)]
*  financed and directed from Moscow by a fugitive Moldovan tycoon. So certainly tight there with [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1609.36s)]
*  Moscow. So it turned out well. Everybody's thrilled. The EU is thrilled. Washington has been [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1617.12s)]
*  supporting Sandhu politically and with an enormous amount of foreign aid. But she can rest on her [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  laurels for a very short period of time. Next year, Moldova holds parliamentary elections. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1630.8s)]
*  There's no sign that the Russians are going to back off. And we're going to see if the Trump [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1635.44s)]
*  administration was going to continue to support Sandhu with the same level of enthusiasm. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1639.3600000000001s)]
*  It is a pretty impressive development given, again, if you look at a map, tiny Moldova perched up [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1644.96s)]
*  against Ukraine with a separatist region where there are Russian troops, heavy Russian misinformation [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1651.44s)]
*  campaigns. This is the weakest country in Europe. The yearning to be part of Europe, the yearning to [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1656.56s)]
*  support a candidate who wants to be part of Europe was compelling and they did it. And it is a story [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1661.84s)]
*  definitely worth watching and seeing where they're able to take it in the coming years. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1668.0s)]
*  Well, I want to believe, and it certainly was a very happy outcome, but we do have to note, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1671.52s)]
*  and the pro-Russian socialist party, which was backing her opponent, denounced the election [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1677.36s)]
*  outcome, said that she was an illegitimate president, claiming that their candidate had [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1682.48s)]
*  won the majority of votes cast inside Moldova. And I think that is actually true. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1686.48s)]
*  She won because she got 80% of the more than 300,000 people who voted from outside the country. And [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1691.2s)]
*  you had people voting in London, you had people voting, a lot of them in Romania itself. Moldova [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1698.56s)]
*  has lost an enormous amount of population because their economy is done so poorly. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  So this is the sort of the internationalist vote wanting Moldova to prosper and be internationalist [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1708.16s)]
*  and part of the EU. So I think a lot of the sort of grievance vote that exists in a lot of countries [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1715.44s)]
*  in Europe is still there as well inside of Moldova and they went for her opponent. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1722.16s)]
*  But she didn't steal the election, even though the pro-Moscow guy said she did. She won fair and [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1728.4s)]
*  square. And that's our look at the world next week. Here are some other stories to keep an eye on. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1733.76s)]

*  anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Another happy story. 35 years, Carla, can you believe it? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArRya0kIcU&t=1749.8400000000001s)]
