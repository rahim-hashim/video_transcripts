# GOP Election Enthusiasm, Netanyahu Addresses U.S. Congress, Cyprus 50 Years After Invasion, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA)
*  In the coming week, the world reacts to the U.S. Republican presidential ticket. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu addresses the U.S. Congress, and tensions in Cyprus [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  are high 50 years after the Turkish invasion divided the island. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  It's July 18, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=12.44s)]
*  I'm Paul McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=27.04s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=28.04s)]
*  Carly, let's start here in the United States where there is a heck of a lot going on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  It has been a momentous week for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=33.12s)]
*  And we should note, as this podcast was being taped, it was a few hours ahead of his capping [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=37.64s)]
*  speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=42.14s)]
*  His party's nominating convention there has been rallying vigorously behind Trump following [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=45.96s)]
*  the weekend assassination attempt and the announcement of his vice presidential running [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=54.64s)]
*  Through the course of events, there has been reinforcement of Trump's populist messages [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=57.08s)]
*  on trade, immigration, and U.S. alliances, to name a few. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=60.96s)]
*  Carla, how's this playing in the rest of the world? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=64.56s)]
*  Well, it's head spinning abroad just like it's been here, Bob, between the attempt on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=67.04s)]
*  President Trump's life and now the revived questions about whether President Biden is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=71.92s)]
*  going to remain in the race and, of course, President Biden's COVID diagnosis. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=76.16s)]
*  So for anyone watching, the GOP convention has exercised the last vestiges of traditional [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=81.32s)]
*  Republican internationalism. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=86.08s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this, but Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was booed when he appeared [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=88.36s)]
*  in Milwaukee on Monday night. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=93.08s)]
*  And the crowd cheered Marjorie Taylor Greene as she denounced globalist tech investor David [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=94.84s)]
*  Sacks in his own primetime speech blamed President Biden for provoking the Russians to invade [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=100.28s)]
*  Ukraine with talk of NATO expansion. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=105.16s)]
*  And the crowd in the convention center has been out there waving end the war in Ukraine [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=107.88s)]
*  signs along with those signs calling for mass deportations. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=110.92s)]
*  So bye bye, Republican internationalism once and for all. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=114.32s)]
*  And the rest of the world has been watching very closely. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=117.96s)]
*  And what has gotten the most attention abroad has been the choice of JD Vance as his running [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  mate. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=125.28s)]
*  Let's face it, vice presidents may not have any real influence on policy, but the signaling [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  here is clear and loud. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=131.16s)]
*  President Trump is not looking to balance the ticket in any way. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=133.04s)]
*  And he certainly isn't looking for the sort of adult supervision on national security [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=136.28s)]
*  that frustrated him so much in the first term when he found his impulses stymied again and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  again by Defense Secretary General Jim Mattis, by National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  and Chief of Staff John Kelly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  Remember the days when he loved his generals and then he got so frustrated by them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=152.0s)]
*  So Vance is a very different guy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=155.94s)]
*  He's full on MAGA and like Trump, he's a guy who really relishes breaking the crockery. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  The new starboard government in Britain has shrugged off his comments that Britain under [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=163.44s)]
*  labor could be seen as the first Islamist country with a nuclear weapon, but they are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  clearly not amused and everybody else is pretty nervous about this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=172.36s)]
*  So on policy, Vance is pretty much but not completely in lockstep with Trump. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=177.0s)]
*  In the days before the invasion of Ukraine, he declared on Steve Bannon's podcast that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=182.58s)]
*  he thought it was, quote, ridiculous that we're focused on this border and said he didn't [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  He tried to block Ukraine funding in the Senate, arguing that Putin doesn't pose an [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=195.16s)]
*  existential threat to Europe, that Ukraine cannot beat the Russians and the US does not [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=198.68s)]
*  have manufacturing capacity to support a ground where Eastern Europe indefinitely. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=203.68s)]
*  He has an enormous amount of swagger. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=209.16s)]
*  Even when he went to Munich, which was his first appearance there, he skipped a meeting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=210.76s)]
*  with Zelensky arguing that he didn't think it would learn anything new from it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  That was the Munich Security Conference earlier this year. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=218.94s)]
*  At the same time, unlike Trump, he has said he doesn't think we should pull out of NATO. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=221.48s)]
*  Trump has been back and forth on that, so not completely locked up on that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=226.16s)]
*  We'll see where he comes out, of course, now that he's part of the ticket. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=229.56s)]
*  He told The Times last month he thinks we should make it as hard as possible for China [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=233.64s)]
*  to take Taiwan. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=237.32s)]
*  He's very much of that group there that's arguing that we shouldn't be focused on Ukraine. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  We should be much more focused on Taiwan. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  And he complained that we're not focused on Taiwan because we're giving all these weapons [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=249.6s)]
*  But even there, there may be some real daylight with Trump. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=250.92s)]
*  This Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek just this past week that Taiwan should be paying [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  us for defense. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=257.36s)]
*  Lots of that complaining that we heard about South Korea, Japan, lots of other countries. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=259.24s)]
*  And keep in mind that Taiwan already pays for nearly all of the weapons it orders from [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=267.0s)]
*  So potentially some daylight there on that, but it doesn't matter. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=268.24s)]
*  Ultimately, it's the president who gets to decide. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=271.4s)]
*  On climate, Vance is in lockstep with Trump, questioning the human causes for climate change. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=274.32s)]
*  He floated legislation last year to repeal the clean vehicle tax credit in the IRA very [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=279.0s)]
*  much with Trump on hating on EVs as much as possible. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  And he seems most enthusiastic when it comes to economic protectionism, another way Trump's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=289.04s)]
*  choice is challenging traditional GOP values. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=294.24s)]
*  Vance is a fierce believer in tariffs. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=298.12s)]
*  Trump has talked about 60 percent tariff on Chinese imports and 10 percent across the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=299.88s)]
*  board, much to the dismay of the Europeans. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=303.88s)]
*  He's also called for a higher minimum wage and increased barriers to corporate mergers. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=306.52s)]
*  Don't know whether Trump is on board with that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=310.88s)]
*  Yeah, you're right to point out for starters, Carla, that it's not clear exactly what a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  vice presidential candidate brings to foreign policy at the end of the day. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=318.5s)]
*  But it's not insignificant. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=322.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of messaging going on, as you indicated. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=323.84s)]
*  And certainly, as a starting point, if you just contrast it with Trump's previous vice [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=326.35999999999996s)]
*  president, Mike Pence, who, while really unstintingly loyal, was an internationalist Republican [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  in many respects in terms of national security and the NATO alliance and a lot of the standard [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=336.32s)]
*  sort of Republican establishment foreign policy values he definitely held. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=342.04s)]
*  At the end of the day, he was not willing to go against the norms and not certify the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=346.56s)]
*  results of the 2020 election. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=350.88s)]
*  Something Vance says he would definitely not have certified. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=353.28s)]
*  Something Vance is saying he would do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=357.64s)]
*  And by the way, the January 6th events, all but certainly not acknowledged in terms of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=358.64s)]
*  being something bad. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=362.64s)]
*  Something that's hovering there and behind all of this as well, in addition to feeling [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=365.04s)]
*  like there was a great deal of momentum and really confident that Trump will win outright. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=369.38000000000005s)]
*  There's still messaging coming from Trump campaign officials that they won't accept [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=373.72s)]
*  a non-Trump victory if that's the result that comes in November. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=377.12s)]
*  So that's a concern that's separate from all the foreign policy issues. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  That's sort of a US democracy, national security concern. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  The foreign policy issues that you mentioned are very interesting. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  I think there's a number, aside from Ukraine, there could be some other areas where there's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=390.72s)]
*  internal dissent. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  I think there's been a number of reports coming out of the Milwaukee convention about concern [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=397.0s)]
*  about the populist economic message and what that means for Republican donors who have [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=401.68s)]
*  done quite well through trade and through policies that the campaign is now saying it's [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=406.68s)]
*  going to turn against. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=411.6s)]
*  And certainly tariffs, those who understand tariffs know very well what impact that can [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=412.6s)]
*  have. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=417.0s)]
*  And it also has an impact on inflation. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=418.0s)]
*  So I think when the rubber meets the road, you might start seeing some modification of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=419.8s)]
*  some of the rhetoric here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=423.52s)]
*  And conventions are nothing if not full-fledged areas for rhetoric and exaggeration and so [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=425.12s)]
*  forth. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=432.44s)]
*  But there is a consistency here. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=433.44s)]
*  And then, as you said, by virtue of just choosing JD Vance, Trump is doubling down on his message [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=434.88s)]
*  and finding someone from a younger generation who articulates even more than he does the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=440.52s)]
*  America First mantras. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=446.52s)]
*  And so it was also revealing that this convention, we kicked off with a very long address by [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=448.76s)]
*  a labor official from the Teamsters. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=453.64s)]
*  So organized labor is now speaking at the Republican convention. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=457.08s)]
*  Populist message is very strong and isolationist message, although not complete, is still permeating. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=460.92s)]
*  So that is, I think, what the world is looking at. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=466.4s)]
*  I think there is a great deal of concern about how to deal with this incoming administration. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=469.0s)]
*  But there are officials who are reaching out. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=474.14s)]
*  I think the Keir Starmer administration has already reached out to Trump, for example. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=475.84s)]
*  And I think there's a bit of pragmatism that's starting to set hold, or at least practicality, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=479.0s)]
*  about what a second Trump administration will mean with a different cast of people in important [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  cabinet roles. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  That's the thing to really watch in terms of who emerges beyond VP, who emerges in these [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  crucial roles that countries are going to need to deal with and try to deal with in [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=495.15999999999997s)]
*  a sense of confidence, Defense Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, and so forth. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  So Starmer, of course, is hosting this meeting in Blenheim today, somewhat counter-programming [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=504.32s)]
*  their long plan. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=510.32s)]
*  And they are talking about how Russia poses a threat across Europe. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=512.04s)]
*  Zelensky is there. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  And they are certainly talking about how they're going to have to push forward. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=517.68s)]
*  We haven't seen the reports fully from the meeting. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=521.08s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be criticizing the Republicans or Trump about it because [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=523.16s)]
*  not that they're predicting inevitability here, but they're certainly very nervous about [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=527.64s)]
*  the same way they were talking about Trump proofing last week at the NATO summit. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  But Europe's got some really big questions here about how much they are going to try [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  to wheedle, how much they're going to try and work with Trump on this, and how much [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  they themselves are going to have to make decisions about whether they can go it alone [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=542.88s)]
*  on Ukraine. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  Vance talks about manufacturing capabilities, how much they themselves continue to support [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  Ukraine and what they're going to do if Trump is elected. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=552.24s)]
*  And he goes to them and says, I've got a deal with Russia. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=554.24s)]
*  What are you guys going to do? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=557.6400000000001s)]
*  So there's some really big decisions ahead if Trump is elected. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=558.68s)]
*  But it's still quite a while until the election themselves. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=561.56s)]
*  I think migration also is one more point which we need to think about. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=565.8s)]
*  There are all those signs out there, stop the migrant invasion. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  That's part of the 20 promises in the platform. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=572.52s)]
*  Carry out the largest deportation operation in American history. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=575.4s)]
*  I think to find that personally intrinsically un-American, it certainly has strong populist [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=578.68s)]
*  appeal to some of the brightest governments in Europe itself. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=583.96s)]
*  But when you talk about it going against the grain for American business, I think there's [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=587.98s)]
*  a lot of business leaders who also are going to bristle against us. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=591.38s)]
*  So there's a lot to watch here. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=594.66s)]
*  There's the business community and there is some, just the legality of it is going to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=596.14s)]
*  run up against some real problems. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=600.58s)]
*  I mean, the first Trump administration, if that is indeed the case, that was the first [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=601.58s)]
*  of two, dealt with quite a bit of legal challenges in terms of some of its immigration policy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=605.22s)]
*  And deportation certainly could not be handled in the way promised at this convention. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=610.32s)]
*  But they will certainly take a strong position. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=615.68s)]
*  There are some things they can do. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=617.88s)]
*  I think one other thing that's going to be interesting that plays out is a result of [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=619.6999999999999s)]
*  this latest incredible session of the Supreme Court where the ruling, the so-called Chevron [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=623.3199999999999s)]
*  ruling takes out of the executive's hands the ability to exercise authority in certain [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=627.64s)]
*  areas like immigration, for example. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=631.4799999999999s)]
*  And that will be interesting to see how much that runs up against this ruling. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=634.0s)]
*  Bob, let's shift to Washington, D.C. where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=637.92s)]
*  was set to address a joint session of Congress next Wednesday, July 24th. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=642.48s)]
*  Despite growing tensions between the two, Netanyahu is also scheduled to meet with U.S. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=647.24s)]
*  President Joe Biden. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  Whether that will go forward with the president's COVID diagnosis, we'll have to see. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=652.6800000000001s)]
*  Like Netanyahu's 2015 address to Congress, this invitation was pointedly issued without [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=656.72s)]
*  the White House's blessing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=661.52s)]
*  Indeed, Republican leaders were describing it as a way to jam Biden and Democratic leaders [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=662.88s)]
*  by highlighting tensions over the Gaza war. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=667.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, back in Israel, some opposition leaders there and hundreds of academics have [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=670.5200000000001s)]
*  been urging the U.S. to disinvite the prime minister. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=674.2s)]
*  Nevertheless, Bibi is coming. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=677.24s)]
*  So Bob, what should we expect out of this speech? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=678.96s)]
*  You're right. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=682.5200000000001s)]
*  The speech is the focus point, and we don't know to the extent to which Netanyahu is going [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=683.5200000000001s)]
*  to have the ability to meet with administration officials. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=686.2800000000001s)]
*  We're going to post a piece on our website shortly from our colleague Stephen Cook about [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=689.5200000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=693.44s)]
*  And he basically points out that Netanyahu is going to need to be messaging in multiple [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=694.44s)]
*  directions. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=698.6s)]
*  He's going to be messaging to the Israeli public, which as you say, he's faced a great [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=700.0s)]
*  deal of opposition from, but basically demonstrate to them that he has the support of the crucial [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  ally of the United States and that he comes across with a message that resonates in Congress [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=708.28s)]
*  about what kind of struggle the Israelis have been up against for the last nine months and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=713.44s)]
*  what they plan to do. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure you're going to see great deal of sort of mapping out of a Gaza plan per [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=719.12s)]
*  But you will see a doubling down on Israel's approach and Israel's right to defend itself, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=724.84s)]
*  not only vis-a-vis Hamas, but against Hezbollah, against which there's an escalating and worrisome [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=730.6s)]
*  conflict in the north of the country near the Lebanese border. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=736.1s)]
*  So as Stephen writes in his piece, they're going to be looking for to sort of signal [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=739.44s)]
*  that they're going to be shortly moving on or hoping to move on from the conflict in [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=743.84s)]
*  Gaza and focusing on the conflict with Hezbollah, which is of a different magnitude altogether. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=748.1s)]
*  Hezbollah, among other things, possesses more than 100,000 missiles of various sorts that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=753.94s)]
*  could do damage, despite the very effective missile shield we've seen in Israel. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=758.74s)]
*  And there's already caused tens of thousands of Israelis to have to flee the border areas [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=763.26s)]
*  in the north. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=767.46s)]
*  And so that would involve all sorts of things because Hezbollah is, among other things, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=768.58s)]
*  a prime proxy of Iran and could involve an important added U.S. military commitment in [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=771.78s)]
*  the area. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=777.58s)]
*  So there's that existential issue involving these two conflicts. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=778.58s)]
*  There's the relationship issue involving how much the U.S. has Israel's back. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=782.94s)]
*  And you'll certainly see Republicans and full-throated support for Netanyahu in Congress. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=787.4200000000001s)]
*  And then it's a question of how much this plays on the domestic Israeli scene where [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=793.0200000000001s)]
*  people are still very upset, not only about the unresolved hostage situation and not having [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=796.98s)]
*  been returned, but any sort of sense of a plan for what next in Gaza. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=804.06s)]
*  And in the run-up to this visit, there's been a real ramping up of Israeli military strikes [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=809.5799999999999s)]
*  throughout Gaza. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=813.66s)]
*  Last weekend, they went after the head of Hamas's military arm and seemingly were not [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=814.66s)]
*  successful, but there was high casualties. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=819.0999999999999s)]
*  And Gaza continues to be a fraught humanitarian situation. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=821.8599999999999s)]
*  The U.S. just announced it was abandoning its plan for this humanitarian pier. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=824.8599999999999s)]
*  It was an attempt. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=829.0999999999999s)]
*  It was a creative attempt to try to provide another way to get aid into Gaza. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=830.62s)]
*  But everything that happened with that, both logistically and sort of politically, showed [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=834.94s)]
*  how difficult that whole process is. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=839.0600000000001s)]
*  And the humanitarian situation remains really dire. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=841.5s)]
*  Why is Bibi so determined to do this speech? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=843.82s)]
*  I mean, does it get a benefit for it back home? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=846.86s)]
*  I mean, there was a long time in which any Israeli leader got a benefit for having the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=850.02s)]
*  blessing of U.S. leaders. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=854.94s)]
*  But that relationship with, you know, Biden is a strained one, to put it mildly. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=856.9399999999999s)]
*  Why is he so determined to come when he's sort of the 13th guest at the wedding? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=862.38s)]
*  It really does seem like he feels like he's going to get a boost, some wind in his sails. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=867.8199999999999s)]
*  First of all, it would be a record fourth visit to Congress. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=872.74s)]
*  He was tied to Winston Churchill with three addresses to Congress. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=875.6999999999999s)]
*  So this puts him in his own category. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=878.38s)]
*  Is he going to Missouri also? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=880.38s)]
*  Yeah, maybe there's a Iron Curtain speech in his future. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=883.1s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  And it's not to be underestimated the amount of support he's going to get, especially from [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=887.5799999999999s)]
*  Republicans in Congress. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=891.62s)]
*  And I think whether it's further playing to his coalition, his hardline coalition, or [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=892.9399999999999s)]
*  to other Israelis who are still coping with a really difficult time right now, maybe he [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=899.02s)]
*  sees this as just a net plus to be able to come and get a boost. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=903.6999999999999s)]
*  It was pointed out that his previous visit, politically charged visit in 2015, you know, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=908.54s)]
*  which was in many ways intended to try to disrupt the deal over Iran's nuclear program, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=913.18s)]
*  that it was not successful. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=918.18s)]
*  The U.S. went ahead and brokered the deal. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=919.18s)]
*  But what also happened at that time was that Republicans and other opponents to the deal [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=920.62s)]
*  did not give up their opposition. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=925.94s)]
*  And within not too long afterwards, when the Trump administration came in, they removed [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=927.42s)]
*  the U.S. from that deal. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=931.38s)]
*  So Netanyahu resonated certainly with that base. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=932.74s)]
*  Not only is there a presidential race, obviously, in the U.S., in Congress, we could see a change [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=936.38s)]
*  in control of Congress in terms of both houses. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=940.82s)]
*  And maybe Netanyahu gains some traction there. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=943.5400000000001s)]
*  So for him, it makes sense to go ahead and do this at a time when things couldn't be [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=946.82s)]
*  more difficult in Israel to get a boost from the biggest ally that the country has. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=951.38s)]
*  And do we have any sense of whether the Hamas talks are going to be revived anytime soon? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=956.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, that's interesting. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=962.26s)]
*  Even as these Israeli IDF attacks have been ramping up, there have been talks going on. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=963.26s)]
*  There have been talks over RAFA, for example, involving the U.S.-Israeli Palestinian Authority [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=968.54s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=974.42s)]
*  And there continue to be a number of top figures, U.S. Middle East envoy Brett McGurk and top [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=975.62s)]
*  Israeli officials talking about the logistics involving the end phase in Gaza in terms of [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=981.8199999999999s)]
*  the end phase of hot military action. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=988.62s)]
*  So I think that continues to percolate. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=991.34s)]
*  I wouldn't rule it out on top of everything else, but it still seems like it's so intractable [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=993.3000000000001s)]
*  in terms of what they're willing to ultimately agree to that it just feels like compromise [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=998.5s)]
*  is still remote. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1002.74s)]
*  Well, we'll see which BB we get, the conciliatory BB or the pugnacious BB in front of Congress. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1003.74s)]
*  And who knows? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1010.7800000000001s)]
*  Maybe he's going to bring some good news. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1012.14s)]
*  He'll certainly come back to Israel with a fresh insight into the U.S. political landscape, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1014.7s)]
*  that's for sure. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1018.5s)]
*  Bob, the Mediterranean. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1019.5s)]
*  This Saturday, July 20th, as you said, marks the 50 years since Turkey invaded northern [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1022.58s)]
*  Cyprus and they split the country into two. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1027.7s)]
*  Turkish Cypriots hold the upper third of the country, Greek Cypriots the south, and there's [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1031.7s)]
*  only this very thin UN-protected green line, which is a buffer zone which separates the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1035.7s)]
*  two. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1040.22s)]
*  And in the past few months, the UN peacekeeping mission has reported a 70% increase in buffer [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1041.22s)]
*  zone breaches. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1047.72s)]
*  A lot of this seems innocuous, it's name calling, but there has also been something [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1048.98s)]
*  of a scale up of security forces on both sides. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1054.42s)]
*  Is there a real threat of conflict here? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1057.5s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a reminder that the world has a number of these so-called frozen conflict [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1059.7s)]
*  zones and that they're not frozen forever. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1065.7s)]
*  Some of the other ones are in the former Soviet space, for example, and a recent example would [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1068.8600000000001s)]
*  be the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave that was contested by ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1072.8600000000001s)]
*  After a couple of decades, Azerbaijan finally gained the upper hand and was able to win [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1079.8200000000002s)]
*  the day and ethnically cleanse the enclave in Nagorno-Karabakh of something like 100,000 [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1084.6200000000001s)]
*  ethnic Armenians. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1090.5s)]
*  And that's still playing out and it's still the source of a great deal of anxiety, especially [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1091.8600000000001s)]
*  in Armenia right now. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1096.5400000000002s)]
*  And you have frozen conflicts in Georgia and Moldova and other parts of the world. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1098.26s)]
*  And this one now, 50 years old, is one that has the potential to have impact far beyond [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1103.74s)]
*  Cyprus, but certainly for Cypriots, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots who've inhabited [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1108.74s)]
*  this island for years and years, it's a source of a great deal of angst. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1112.4199999999998s)]
*  Fifty years ago with the Turkish invasion, you had people fleeing their homes thinking [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1117.48s)]
*  they're going to be coming back within a couple of days and never returning. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1121.06s)]
*  And it's thousands on both sides left. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1124.74s)]
*  There's this buffer zone that runs across the island. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1127.3s)]
*  And as you say, there's arming up going on. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1131.5s)]
*  There is a UN mission that's supposed to be maintaining the status quo while diplomatic [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1132.76s)]
*  efforts that have lurched back and forth over the years are supposed to be trying to come [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  up with some sort of permanent solution. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1142.52s)]
*  And it's at loggerheads. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1145.18s)]
*  There were some hopes back in 2017, the so-called Trans Montana Summit, where they were going [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1146.7s)]
*  to come up with a deal that would finally settle the issues between the two sides. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1152.46s)]
*  At the moment, it's Turkish Cypriots want two states, want to exist side by side. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1157.14s)]
*  They have declared independence on their side for the last 40 years, recognized by nobody [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1161.46s)]
*  but Turkey, and a handful of other states do business with them. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1165.74s)]
*  But it's really a Turkish recognized affair. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1169.22s)]
*  And then there's the Greek side of the island, which is actually part of the EU. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1171.8400000000001s)]
*  But the EU considers it unfinished business and would love to get this process solved [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1175.26s)]
*  because of the animosities and because of the fact that it could be a flashpoint ultimately [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1178.66s)]
*  between Greeks and Turkey. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1183.22s)]
*  We talked previously not too long ago in this podcast about Greek and Turkish leaders actually [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1185.2s)]
*  have been involved in rapprochement of sorts. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1189.38s)]
*  But there are lots of issues that the two countries are still at odds over. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1192.68s)]
*  And Cyprus is an extension of some of that. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1196.8s)]
*  And some of it also has to do with Cyprus's own location in the Mediterranean. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1199.1200000000001s)]
*  Among other things are nearby hydrocarbon deposits. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1203.66s)]
*  Who has sovereignty over those? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1206.5800000000002s)]
*  Who claims them? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1208.2s)]
*  Well, you know, the Greek Cypriots think they do and can benefit from exploiting, say, national [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1209.2s)]
*  gas reserves. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1213.76s)]
*  But that can't happen seemingly unless they reach agreement with Turkish Cypriots. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1215.1s)]
*  It's a very complicated situation. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1219.1s)]
*  But it's one in which this anniversary is sort of bringing fresh light to because I [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1221.5s)]
*  think most people recognize the status quo is not really acceptable there. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  And frozen conflicts are not frozen forever. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1231.5s)]
*  So we did talk about Erdogan and Mitsotakis meeting and sort of declaring that they saw [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1234.36s)]
*  no unsolvable problems and wanting to move things ahead. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1240.6599999999999s)]
*  How much control do they actually have over these disagreeing parties? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1244.5s)]
*  And are they proxies for those disagreements or are they just unruly ethnic allies who [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1249.88s)]
*  they actually don't have control over? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1257.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a good point. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1258.7s)]
*  I think we should not consider them mere pawns for these two bigger countries. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1259.98s)]
*  They actually do have their own agency. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1264.82s)]
*  Even the northern Cyprus Turkish Cypriots are not in total lockstep with what Ankara [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1267.22s)]
*  is decreeing, even though they really heavily rely on Turkey. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1272.26s)]
*  It's basically its connection to the outside world. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1276.1s)]
*  That's one of the things that's complicated these efforts, these painstaking efforts over [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1278.9s)]
*  the years, especially this century to try to come to a final agreement. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1281.98s)]
*  So I do think that if you had a real sense of momentum at the levels of Athens and Ankara, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1286.2s)]
*  you could create some pressure that might bring us at least out of these tensions and [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1293.8s)]
*  into some sort of more productive diplomatic path. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1298.76s)]
*  But beyond that, they've walked up to the water, but have not been able to drink and [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1302.02s)]
*  it's really posing a problem. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1305.74s)]
*  So I think there's further attention on just kind of maintaining peace, not letting the [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1307.08s)]
*  situation get out of hand and coming up with some sort of practical way. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1313.78s)]
*  I mean, the two sides do have some technical agreements, the two sides of the island, maybe [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1317.6200000000001s)]
*  building on that to try to create ties that are more practical and not antagonistic. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1322.0s)]
*  But these skirmishes at the border, they have to do with occasionally there's activity on [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1327.52s)]
*  one side of the other that the other side sees as threatening. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1331.2s)]
*  And, you know, I think it's things like that that make this worth keeping an eye on and [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1334.32s)]
*  worth the attention. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1338.8600000000001s)]
*  And certainly having the Greek-Sypriot side of the island as part of the EU helps in that [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1340.14s)]
*  you have EU attention to this and EU resources, diplomatic and otherwise, that can sometimes [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1345.18s)]
*  come into bear and have an impact. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1350.5800000000002s)]
*  Again, it's been overlooked amidst everything else going on in the Middle East, but it actually [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1352.44s)]
*  has ramifications for the area. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1356.44s)]
*  Among other things, Cyprus is an important sort of staging point for humanitarian aid [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1358.0800000000002s)]
*  for the Middle East, as well as a place where refugees tend to get funneled through on their [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1362.8s)]
*  way across the Mediterranean. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1367.1200000000001s)]
*  Carla, we've talked ourselves into the audience figure of the week portion of the episode. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1369.48s)]
*  This is where listeners vote every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's Instagram [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1376.1200000000001s)]
*  story. This week, our audience selected, interestingly, Communist Party leader Oli is [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1381.24s)]
*  Nepal's new prime minister. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1386.52s)]
*  What does this mean for Nepal? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1388.86s)]
*  Never would have predicted they would have chosen this one. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1392.1399999999999s)]
*  Bob, when I started co-hosting, I was a bit confused about whether the audience figure [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1394.9s)]
*  was supposed to be a figure number or a figure person. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1400.54s)]
*  And you and Esther explained to me it could be either. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1405.82s)]
*  And in this case, it's both. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1410.34s)]
*  The stats around Nepal's disruptive politics are pretty incredible and concerning. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1413.48s)]
*  KP Sharma Oli, who leads Nepal's largest Communist Party, which is actually a moderate [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1419.36s)]
*  grouping. This is his fourth stint in the job. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  He's Nepal's fifth prime minister in five years. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1428.72s)]
*  And this is the 14th government since 2008 when Nepal's 239 year old Hindu monarchy was [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1432.04s)]
*  overthrown. And what he's promising above all else is political stability, something [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1438.36s)]
*  most people inside and outside the country are skeptical he or anyone else can deliver. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1443.74s)]
*  And his predecessor, Pushpa Kamal Dehal, who led the violent insurgency that overthrew [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1449.3799999999999s)]
*  the monarchy, well, he served as prime minister three times and he was subjected to five [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1454.56s)]
*  confidence votes. This could be like a kid's rhyme here during his nearly two year tenure [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1459.62s)]
*  before being voted out. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1464.1599999999999s)]
*  As for the sources of this instability, Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1465.38s)]
*  and the political instability has discouraged outside investment, feeding more instability. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1469.8200000000002s)]
*  And there's constant meddling from neighboring China and India, which certainly isn't [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1475.18s)]
*  helping. And so Nepal is squeezed by this geopolitical rivalry and add to that, in [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1479.0600000000002s)]
*  particular, China's further interest in preventing any anti-Chinese activities in Nepal [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1485.0600000000002s)]
*  by supporters of Tibet. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1489.8600000000001s)]
*  In his first term as prime minister in 2015, India imposed an unofficial economic blockade [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1491.1s)]
*  on oil, medicine and other materials, which led to severe shortages and was in response [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1497.1s)]
*  to a reform of their constitution. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1504.4199999999998s)]
*  So we'll see whether he does any better this time around. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1508.1799999999998s)]
*  This is just a really, really hard place with nothing other than people trying to meddle [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1511.5s)]
*  and constant instability. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1515.62s)]
*  That's kind of a fascinating rundown, Carla, because maybe like many, my knowledge of Nepal [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1517.38s)]
*  is almost limited to its Himalayan hiking prowess or the incredible Himalayan hiking [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1522.1000000000001s)]
*  venues there are there. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1528.3400000000001s)]
*  It's beauty and its reputation as a place for sort of ecotourists to come. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1529.6200000000001s)]
*  But it obviously has this political backdrop and it's in this place. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1534.7800000000002s)]
*  If you look at a map, it's really, you know, at this loggerhead between Nepal and India. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1538.8200000000002s)]
*  Who are starting to compete in other parts, too, and have their own sort of mountain border [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1543.1s)]
*  dispute on top of everything else. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1547.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm saying India and China there. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1548.9799999999998s)]
*  So do we think Oli's got the stuff to bring Nepal through? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1550.62s)]
*  You're now going beyond my expertise here. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1555.58s)]
*  As I said, if history is any guide, but certainly these people deserve a break. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1557.5s)]
*  And it would be nice if their neighbors could be there. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1563.74s)]
*  But I think it's a great place to be. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1566.6999999999998s)]
*  Certainly these people deserve a break and it would be nice if their neighbors gave them a break. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1568.58s)]
*  All right. Spotlight on Nepal. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1574.26s)]
*  We will keep an eye on that and possibly return to it. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1575.7s)]
*  And that's our look at the world next week. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOKN-yrGPA&t=1578.74s)]
