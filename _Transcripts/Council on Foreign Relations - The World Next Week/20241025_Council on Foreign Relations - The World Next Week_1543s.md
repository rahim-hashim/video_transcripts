# France Presses for Lebanon Aid, Japan Holds Snap Election, Georgia’s Divided Vote, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI)
*  In the coming week, France intensifies a push for humanitarian aid and a ceasefire in Lebanon, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=0.0s)]
*  Japan holds a snap general election, and Georgia hits the polls with the country divided over [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=5.8s)]
*  pro-Russian or EU sentiments. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=9.88s)]
*  It's October 24th, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=12.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  Carla, let's get going with Lebanon, where the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah continues. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  Now, this is a country seen as a quasi-failed state by some, and its government is ill-equipped, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  to say the least, to help the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by Israel's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=39.8s)]
*  ground offensive in southern Lebanon and stepped up bombing campaign in the south and other [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=44.32s)]
*  places. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=48.2s)]
*  Hezbollah continues to send rockets into Israel as well. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=49.2s)]
*  U.S. Secretary of State Blinken was in Tel Aviv to try to revive peace negotiations this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=51.56s)]
*  week and briefly had to take shelter during a Hezbollah rocket attack. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=55.28s)]
*  France's President Emmanuel Macron has been outspoken in calling for a ceasefire and humanitarian [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=59.68s)]
*  aid to Lebanon, and even an end to arms exports to Israel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=64.16s)]
*  He's hosting an international conference as we were sitting down for this podcast that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=68.36s)]
*  was supposed to be in support of Lebanon. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=71.88s)]
*  So can France make a difference or push things forward in that way? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=73.84s)]
*  Well, Lebanon certainly needs all of the help it can get. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=78.12s)]
*  There's some debate about the numbers here, as there always are in the midst of a war, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=81.28s)]
*  estimate is around 600,000 people are displaced within the country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=85.68s)]
*  Another 400,000 have fled across the border into Syria. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  And as you said, its government, such as it is, is barely functional. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  It hasn't had a president for two years. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=96.92s)]
*  It's been effectively bankrupt since the financial collapse of 2019 and 2020. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  And its military is only slightly better shape. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  And why that matters is because any potential deal to end the war will need the Lebanese [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=106.68s)]
*  army. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  Despite its condition, it's still the most trusted institution in the country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=113.52s)]
*  They're going to need them to help establish a security zone along the border with Israel, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=117.24s)]
*  along potentially with these UN peacekeepers that are there and unfortunately can't do [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  anything. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=126.64s)]
*  So far, Hezbollah, which operates as a state within a state, and its benefactor Iran are [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=127.92s)]
*  driving all the action. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=132.18s)]
*  So the most Macron's conference was likely to produce, and it's not to be dismissed, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  because Lebanon really needs money. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=139.12s)]
*  And France had a target of half a billion euros or about $540 million. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=142.52s)]
*  And by the end of Thursday, France's foreign minister announced that they'd received pledges [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=147.76s)]
*  and keep in mind pledges aren't money, but pledges of $800 million in humanitarian aid [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=152.56s)]
*  and another $200 million for Lebanon's security forces. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  And that money was 300 million from the US, more than 100 million from France, and nearly [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=162.36s)]
*  the same from Germany. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=167.76s)]
*  And I think they'll probably ante up that money. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=169.56s)]
*  And now it's a lot of money, but Lebanon needs so much more. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=172.8s)]
*  There was never really a chance that this meeting was going to produce a diplomatic [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=176.72s)]
*  breakthrough because except for the French, who have been part of ceasefire efforts in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=179.92s)]
*  Lebanon, none of the other key players were there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=183.96s)]
*  Israel wasn't there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=186.12s)]
*  Hezbollah didn't have any representatives at the table. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=187.12s)]
*  Iran wasn't there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=189.64s)]
*  And Secretary of State Tony Blinken, who is in the region, he sent an aide to represent [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=191.4s)]
*  the US. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=196.04s)]
*  So not really a place for diplomatic negotiations. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=197.52s)]
*  That said, the hope has been since the death of both Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Hezbollah [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=201.88000000000002s)]
*  leader Hassan Nasrallah, that there's potentially a new path for a wider ceasefire deal. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=206.72s)]
*  But US Special Envoy Amos Hoxtey was in Bay Road earlier this week, and he warned that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  the situation there had, quote, escalated out of control. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=217.84s)]
*  So not a reshoring delegation from a negotiator. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=220.84s)]
*  Yeah, it is hard to see things getting better before they deteriorate further, frankly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  And as you say, the escalation continues. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  It's not clear what Hezbollah's strength is. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=233.5s)]
*  And I think that's going to be an interesting point. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=236.52s)]
*  We're in the process of preparing a leadership chart graphic for our website. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  And the number of Hezbollah leaders eliminated by Israel is staggering, but that's the number [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=243.56s)]
*  of the ones we know, and we don't know what we don't know. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  And so that will be very interesting to see who steps in. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=250.4s)]
*  By many accounts, despite the really heavy blow Hezbollah has taken, it is still a potent [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  force. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=258.72s)]
*  And certainly if there was any sort of ground combat going on, it is expected to be still [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=259.72s)]
*  potent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=264.48s)]
*  And potent and well-armed for it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=265.48s)]
*  And well-armed, extremely well-armed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=267.56s)]
*  And again, thanks to Iran. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=269.76s)]
*  And then the other thing that everybody's waiting for, although it's been a little [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  bit sidelined, is in what fashion is Israel going to hit Iran in retaliation for the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=274.46000000000004s)]
*  salvo of missiles that hit Israel not that long ago? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=280.32s)]
*  And that has been threatened and appears to be imminent, but we just don't know what's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=284.24s)]
*  going to happen on that front. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=287.92s)]
*  But to what extent will that then trigger a new round of reprisals? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=289.42s)]
*  Those are what things calm down. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=292.52s)]
*  And back to your original point, though, is Hezbollah going to be weakened enough that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=294.12s)]
*  it does not hold its previous position in Lebanon, and then Lebanon is able to assert [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=298.68s)]
*  itself as a state with its security forces in the forefront? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=302.64s)]
*  That seems to be the crucial aspect of all this, that those security forces can get proper [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  aid to patrol their borders, to police within, and then maybe things can be rebuilding. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=309.84s)]
*  But it just seems like a real flight of fancy to think they can do that any time soon. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  And Hezbollah, of course, is a political party. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  It's a social welfare organization. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  It's all of these things. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  It really, I think, the different- Lebanon is fractured into Shia factions, where Hezbollah [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  held sway, and that's a considerable faction. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  It's got Christian, it's got Sunni. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=330.84s)]
*  That's always what comes back to it with Lebanon, and I guess France, having its long-standing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=332.67999999999995s)]
*  ties to Lebanon, feels like it could play a role. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  And then there's the question of what do they want? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=339.3s)]
*  That border, Hezbollah's incredibly well-armed, and certainly infinitely well-armed than Hamas [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=341.58s)]
*  was, but there's been UN Security Council resolutions there forever, and certainly since [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=346.58s)]
*  the 2006 last invasion, last major war. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=350.98s)]
*  But they never lived up to the Lebanese army, couldn't impose the deal. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=354.74s)]
*  Hezbollah was along that border there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=359.26s)]
*  Nobody could put order there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=360.8s)]
*  But it was reasonably calm, comparatively calm, until this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=361.88s)]
*  When Hezbollah began this throwing rockets at Israel, quote, in solidarity with Hamas [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=365.38s)]
*  and what was going on in Gaza, and up until now, and we haven't heard a lot from them, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=372.02s)]
*  they've insisted that they're going to keep doing it until there's some sort of a deal [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=381.46s)]
*  So this seems to be linked. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=383.5s)]
*  Whether they're going to change their position with their leadership, we really don't know. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=385.18s)]
*  Bill Blinken said today, he was in Riyadh, that negotiators were going to resume talks [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=390.02s)]
*  in coming days in Doha. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=395.29999999999995s)]
*  But everybody's also warning they don't know whether Hamas is really willing to talk. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  They were also floating this idea that there might be a mini, mini deal in which maybe [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=401.58s)]
*  there would be a very short ceasefire in exchange for a limited number of prisoners and hostages. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  This great expectation that cutting off the head of Hamas and cutting off the head of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah, at least that round of leadership, was going to change things in a big way. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=417.38s)]
*  So far not. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, the war goes on, lots of people die, and both Gaza and increasingly Lebanon [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=423.09999999999997s)]
*  are being turned into rubble. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  Bob, let's take our conversation to Japan. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=429.62s)]
*  This Sunday, October 27th, the Japanese will vote in an earlier than expected general election. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=432.94s)]
*  And we talked before about the change such as it is in leadership there. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=438.41999999999996s)]
*  I have a newly sworn in prime minister, Ishiba Shigeru, and he hopes to strengthen his and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=443.62s)]
*  his party, the LDP's legitimacy after a year of really damaging party scandals. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=448.82s)]
*  The LDP has held nearly uninterrupted power since 1955, but there seems to be growing [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=453.98s)]
*  support for opposition parties. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=459.3s)]
*  Is the LDP finally in trouble, and does Ishiba know what he's doing in calling these elections? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=461.66s)]
*  That's the big question at the moment. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=466.64s)]
*  There are certainly indications from recent reporting and polling and sort of veteran [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=468.04s)]
*  political observers in Japan that they could be a kind of a hung parliament coming up. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=472.46000000000004s)]
*  Ishiba has said that a goal for his governing coalition, which is LDP and this party known [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=477.18s)]
*  as Kometo, would be to win a simple majority of 233 seats. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=482.14s)]
*  There's 465 seats in parliament. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  That would be a drop of almost 50 from what the two parties had held in the chamber that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=488.1s)]
*  was just dissolved because of this scandal that you mentioned. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=492.1s)]
*  The scandal is still very much there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=495.42s)]
*  Ishiba has been contrite and has said he wants to move on. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=496.74s)]
*  This is a moment for the country heading into a new direction and has tried to lay out [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=499.7s)]
*  the very important agenda that he's trying to accomplish because behind this is LDP and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=504.09999999999997s)]
*  he at the helm as a former defense minister has spoken about trying to beef up the country's [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=508.9s)]
*  defense budget. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=514.74s)]
*  He wants there to be the capability of responding to attacks, basically change the country's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=516.22s)]
*  constitution to allow more military activity than it has been allowed while still saying [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=522.1s)]
*  the country's largely pacifist. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=526.8199999999999s)]
*  We should note there was a recent Nobel Prize awarded to an anti-nuclear group in Japan [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=528.48s)]
*  as a sort of reinforcing that strong feeling of the country not being a wielder or user [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  of nuclear weaponry. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=539.36s)]
*  Even though they're sitting on a pile of plutonium. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=540.84s)]
*  Yes, and had been a strong user of nuclear power until the Fukushima disaster of 2011. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=543.48s)]
*  This is a country that is possibly at a tipping point. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=551.12s)]
*  We could be seeing very unusual for Japan, but as we're seeing more increasingly usual [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=553.2s)]
*  in Europe, a sort of a splintering into coalitions potentially if LDP does not get the level [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=557.76s)]
*  seats that it needs to rule in this block with Kometo. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=563.08s)]
*  The main opposition group is the Constitutional Democratic Party or CDP, but they are seen [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=566.84s)]
*  as by a number of observers as ineffectual and not really capable of rallying any sort [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=572.08s)]
*  of effective opposition block that could challenge the longstanding LDP dominance even with the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=578.24s)]
*  scandal. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not clear what we're going to see coming out of this weekend in terms of Ishiba having [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=584.92s)]
*  a mandate or Japan having a sort of a stalled situation at a really important time, not [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=588.5999999999999s)]
*  only in the security realm, but economically there's a real kind of funk and real concern [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=594.64s)]
*  over rising living costs in this country, which is still one of the world's largest [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=598.5999999999999s)]
*  economies. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=601.8s)]
*  I know we tend to put things in terms of our own self-interest, but let's face it, we're [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=602.8s)]
*  really close to the American election and we have a pretty big choice between outward [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=608.0s)]
*  looking and inward looking. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=612.52s)]
*  Is the Japanese sort of grappling with that word versus inward looking like so many other [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=613.84s)]
*  countries are and has the US election come up in any of these discussions? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=617.88s)]
*  On the latter I have not seen that, although it has been acknowledged whoever emerges as [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=622.72s)]
*  Japanese leaders is going to face a really tough challenge if Donald Trump is elected [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=627.54s)]
*  because Abe Shinzo was especially skillful and because of his particular gifts as a politician [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=632.16s)]
*  and diplomat frankly, he was able to strike a let's say a workable relationship with [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=637.52s)]
*  Donald Trump who is, as we've said many times, has sort of a transactional approach to even [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=642.88s)]
*  the closest US allies. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=647.36s)]
*  So Japan is facing a challenge regardless of who emerges as the next leader, but in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=649.24s)]
*  terms of their worldview, I think it does devolve more to the internal workings in terms [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=654.68s)]
*  of how much are some of these newer politicians, there's a lot of younger politicians, a lot [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=660.34s)]
*  more women that are running for these open seats. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=664.68s)]
*  How much do they see the country governing itself and what might change sort of the compact [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=667.0799999999999s)]
*  we can government and citizens versus how they would be handling themselves in the rest [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=672.92s)]
*  of the world? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=676.8s)]
*  I do think this issue of constitutional change was one that was driven by Abe Shinzo and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=677.8s)]
*  is an LDP priority. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=681.12s)]
*  So that is one that could be affected. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=683.0s)]
*  It could be just sort of shelved for the time being, even while Japan is concerned about [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=685.4s)]
*  what's going on in North Korea, shall we say, and has just come from a period where it has [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=690.24s)]
*  reached remarkable new level of understanding, let's say, with South Korea, which had had [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=694.42s)]
*  very rocky relationships dating back to World War II era. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=699.54s)]
*  So I don't think, to answer your question, Carlo, we're looking at a major sea change, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=702.86s)]
*  but in the LDP being out of the scene is a change and it's a change across the board [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=707.2199999999999s)]
*  for Japan. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=711.3s)]
*  And so I do think it's at the very least Japan in which there's some instability in terms [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=712.3s)]
*  of the government not having a clear cut program at a time when the US is going through its [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=716.86s)]
*  own possible leadership change. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=720.66s)]
*  That's a recipe for some real concern because these are two bedrock countries in the so-called [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=722.22s)]
*  Western Alliance. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=726.62s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=727.62s)]
*  Chinese are probably sitting back and rubbing their hands. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=728.62s)]
*  Carlo, let's stick with the election theme and give a preview of the upcoming vote in [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=730.86s)]
*  Georgia. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=734.86s)]
*  And not in the state of Georgia. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=735.86s)]
*  This is not the state of Georgia, which has its own election concerns and controversies. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=737.4200000000001s)]
*  This Saturday, Georgia will hold a parliamentary election. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=742.64s)]
*  Earlier this year, we saw the ruling pro-Russia Georgian Dream Party pass a controversial [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=745.58s)]
*  foreign agents law that was clearly in part targeted at trying to stop the sort of pro-democratic [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=751.34s)]
*  support that the democracy minded parties or the Western aligned parties, shall we say, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=758.58s)]
*  were getting support from. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=763.7s)]
*  Many believe Georgia Dreams continuation power will strengthen authoritarianism and end all [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=765.34s)]
*  hopes of EU accession, even though Georgia Dreams has said it is in favor of EU accession, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=769.34s)]
*  but it is in favor also of a sort of a Hungary model of EU membership. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=774.9200000000001s)]
*  Is there a chance that the pro-EU democratic leaning parties will prevail or not? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=779.26s)]
*  I think the first thing here is to remember that post-Soviet Georgia has a history of [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=786.1s)]
*  democratic leaders turning into authoritarians. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=791.34s)]
*  So we really want to be careful not to overdo this forces of light versus forces of darkness [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=794.88s)]
*  narratives in Georgia. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=799.52s)]
*  But there's no question about the different aspirations of Georgian voters. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=802.34s)]
*  There's one camp that is championing Georgia's future in Europe and the ideals of free speech [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=806.18s)]
*  and free elections. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=810.78s)]
*  And in the other camp, there's the supporters of the Georgian Dream Party, and they have [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=812.5799999999999s)]
*  a much more populist, nativist, and increasingly pro-Russian future for Georgia. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=816.14s)]
*  And it's true that the Georgian Dream Party started out as a pro-Europe party. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=821.54s)]
*  I don't think they're a pro-Europe party anymore. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=825.9399999999999s)]
*  Certainly what we've seen from the current government, which is led by this Ivan Ishvili, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=829.02s)]
*  who is this billionaire leader, he's described the EU as, quote, the global war party and [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=834.54s)]
*  claims that it's pushing Georgia into a conflict with Russia. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=839.8199999999999s)]
*  So that doesn't sound to me like a guy who really wants to get into the EU. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=842.66s)]
*  As you noted in June, the government adopted this so-called foreign agents law for NGOs [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=846.5s)]
*  and media, and they even overwrote a veto by its pro-European president. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=851.62s)]
*  And this law requires civil society organizations, including newspapers, human rights groups, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=856.5s)]
*  receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad, and a lot of them get funding from [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=862.22s)]
*  abroad. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=866.5s)]
*  They have to register as, quote, pursuing the interests of a foreign power. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=867.66s)]
*  And that's a clear attempt, and we've seen this in a lot of places. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=870.54s)]
*  We've seen it in Egypt. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=873.18s)]
*  We've seen it in Russia. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=874.18s)]
*  We've seen it in a lot of places. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=875.18s)]
*  It's a clear attempt to stigmatize and suppress opposition voices. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=876.3399999999999s)]
*  So now the ruling party is pushing a Russian-style legislation targeting so-called LGBTQ plus [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=880.54s)]
*  propaganda. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=887.42s)]
*  And if this were to go through, same-sex marriages wouldn't be registered. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=889.22s)]
*  Only, quote, heterosexuals would be allowed to adopt children. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=893.1s)]
*  This is really horrifying. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=895.98s)]
*  Changing gender would be outlawed. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=898.34s)]
*  Even references to LGBTQ plus people would be erased from public spaces. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=900.82s)]
*  Nothing could be taught in schools that recognizes different ways of loving and marrying. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=904.74s)]
*  This is just – this is not a democratic vision for the future of Georgia. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=910.78s)]
*  The EU and the US have been so concerned that Brussels has put Georgia's accession to [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=915.98s)]
*  the EU on hold. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=919.8199999999999s)]
*  And funding from the US and EU have been frozen since the law was passed in July of 24. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=922.6999999999999s)]
*  Interestingly enough, pursuing membership into the EU is actually written into Georgia's [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=929.02s)]
*  2018 constitution. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=933.02s)]
*  And I went and looked it up. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=934.66s)]
*  It says, the state constitutional body shall take all necessary measure to ensure Georgia's [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=935.66s)]
*  full integration into the EU and NATO. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=940.5s)]
*  So this is a pretty big shift for them in a reasonably short period of time. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=943.1800000000001s)]
*  Tens of thousands of Georgians marched in the street recently. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=948.1800000000001s)]
*  Opinion polls say that people overwhelmingly want this. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=951.5400000000001s)]
*  But there are candidates from four opposition parties. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=955.26s)]
*  A lot of analysts are warning that that may confuse people. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=957.94s)]
*  We'll just have to see how the vote turns out. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=960.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's – you know, we use the term polarized society so often. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=962.9000000000001s)]
*  It's a bit of a broken record at this point. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=966.74s)]
*  But we're looking at a country which has become polarized, that these demonstrations [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=968.0600000000001s)]
*  are large. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=971.62s)]
*  And the pro-Russian elements in the country are also real. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=973.54s)]
*  My one experience visiting Georgia, it was interesting. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=976.46s)]
*  It was fascinating. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=978.94s)]
*  First of all, it's a remarkable country, culturally rich. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=979.94s)]
*  And it was interesting also to see it's still pretty poor. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=983.14s)]
*  They could really use – and there's a keen desire to have the infrastructure boosting [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=985.74s)]
*  potential that the EU gives it in terms of funding. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=991.34s)]
*  Some of the newer facilities that we saw funded there were either funded by EU projects, E-related [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=994.34s)]
*  projects, or by the country's billionaire power behind the throne, Bidziny Ivanishvili. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1000.26s)]
*  You would point to some new structure, some new facility, and somebody would say, oh, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1005.5s)]
*  that was Ivanishvili's, or oh, that the EU gave us that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1008.74s)]
*  And so this is part of what's at stake. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1011.9399999999999s)]
*  The idea that an individual versus the entire EU, which is sort of an extraordinary thing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1013.9399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1017.9399999999999s)]
*  And an individual, a very rich individual by many, many magnitudes richer than anybody [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1018.9399999999999s)]
*  else in the country and any other even institution who's aligned with Russia, who made a lot [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1023.0s)]
*  of his fortune in Russia. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1028.26s)]
*  It's really important. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1029.7s)]
*  It's also a country that has a deep, long history with its Orthodox Church, has many [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1030.7s)]
*  conservative elements, but also it permeates many things. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1035.5s)]
*  I mean, the countries are extremely proud of its both religious and musical tradition, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1039.26s)]
*  which is all integrated into the Church. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1044.06s)]
*  So many incredible monasteries and churches, UNESCO listed places, and yet they are – there's [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1046.38s)]
*  some of this attempt to align it with Russia or with forces that are against sort of LGBTQ [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1052.18s)]
*  issues, for example. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1057.54s)]
*  Makes this a really difficult time for a lot of Georgians who really want to be part of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1059.1399999999999s)]
*  the Western aligned bloc and see sort of malign influence from Russia. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1062.8999999999999s)]
*  It is also a place, by the way, where many Russians fled to after the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1066.4599999999998s)]
*  It's just a place they feel comfortable in and can function in, ironically enough, in [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1070.4199999999998s)]
*  that these are Russians who did not want to be aligned with the war and can function in [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1074.6599999999999s)]
*  Georgia. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1077.82s)]
*  And yet part of the country is seeing its future aligned with Russia. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1078.82s)]
*  It's happening at the same time that we're coming out of a Moldovan election, razor thin [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1082.02s)]
*  majority voted in favor of EU alignment. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1086.18s)]
*  There's still a runoff to take place with its president who's pro-EU, who is running [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1088.86s)]
*  against a pro-Russian figure, and it's not clear whether she's going to emerge ahead [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1093.18s)]
*  or not. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1097.02s)]
*  That election is the same week as the U.S. elections. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1098.02s)]
*  So there's just a lot at stake in the region, and we don't want to get caught up in the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1100.14s)]
*  black-white Russia versus West thing, but that's going to be the narrative. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1103.54s)]
*  Well, I think the Moldovan election also just shows you it's really hard to sort of figure [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1106.78s)]
*  out what happened there. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1112.1200000000001s)]
*  This referendum was a much milder commitment than the one the Georgians made six years [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1113.94s)]
*  ago. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1118.3s)]
*  The reference was whether they were going to declare the future membership in the EU [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1119.3s)]
*  was a strategic direction in their constitution, much less definitive than the one that the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1124.66s)]
*  Georgians themselves adapted. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1129.1000000000001s)]
*  And as you said, the way the vote came out was much lower than all the polling. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1131.54s)]
*  It was only 50.39 percent. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1135.8200000000002s)]
*  Now what is going on there? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1138.98s)]
*  Are people rethinking their commitment to Europe or is something else going on there? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1140.62s)]
*  The Moldovan government believes that this is the result of a huge amount of money and [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1144.9399999999998s)]
*  disinformation pouring in, hybrid warfare. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1149.1399999999999s)]
*  That's what the EU is describing it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1151.4599999999998s)]
*  The police there have charged a billionaire who's sitting in Russia, claimed that they're [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1153.9399999999998s)]
*  pouring lots of money in, buying votes. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1159.62s)]
*  They're reporting all sorts of disinformation. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1162.1799999999998s)]
*  And interestingly, one of the themes there is that if you hew too closely to the West, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1164.38s)]
*  you're going to end up like Ukraine. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1170.6200000000001s)]
*  And if you want peace and if you want stability, the best thing you can do is be neutral. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1172.46s)]
*  And that certainly is the argument of the gentleman who only got 26 percent of the vote [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1178.22s)]
*  but who was running against the pro-West current president in the runoff. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1183.42s)]
*  But Ukraine really hangs over a lot of this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1188.66s)]
*  And the Russian warning, you don't want to go the way of Ukraine. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1191.9s)]
*  The best thing you can do is just and how many people are buying this? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1195.26s)]
*  How much of this is Russian disinformation? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1199.3400000000001s)]
*  And how much of this is just the realignment we're seeing in the rise of populism? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1206.8200000000002s)]
*  We're just going to have to see how that vote turns out. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1207.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1208.8200000000002s)]
*  Another thing worth pointing out in addition to that is the Russian military sort of overtones [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1209.8200000000002s)]
*  here. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1214.26s)]
*  Moldova has a breakaway region called Transnistria where there are Russian troops based. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1215.26s)]
*  That is a pro-Russian entity. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1218.68s)]
*  Status has been unresolved since basically the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1221.1s)]
*  Georgia has two breakaway regions that are under the sway of Russia as well that had [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1225.34s)]
*  previously constituted almost 20 percent of Georgian territory, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1229.02s)]
*  There was a Russian invasion from South Ossetia in 2008 that sent a real clear signal to the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1233.54s)]
*  Georgians to watch out on their pro-Western tilt and their provocations against Russia [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1238.7s)]
*  at the time which is… [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1243.6599999999999s)]
*  Right after their invitation. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1245.1399999999999s)]
*  Right after their invitation. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1246.56s)]
*  So yeah, we're entering into a new phase with these two countries where it's a very [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1247.56s)]
*  big Russian military overtones. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1251.84s)]
*  Well, the Russians are bullies. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1253.96s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1255.76s)]
*  Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1257.36s)]
*  And this is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1261.1599999999999s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1267.48s)]
*  And this week they selected China and India reach border deal. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1269.2s)]
*  China and India have clashed over this border since the 1960s. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1273.52s)]
*  What caused them to make a deal? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1277.12s)]
*  Do we think the deal is going to last? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1278.9199999999998s)]
*  And is this the result of the BRICS meeting that we were talking about? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1281.4399999999998s)]
*  A positive outcome of this? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1286.04s)]
*  The Russians get any credit for this? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1287.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I go that far on the Russian side, but I do think the BRICS meeting, I [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1289.6s)]
*  think they were moving towards this and provided them a moment for Chinese President Xi Jinping [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1293.6799999999998s)]
*  and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come together and speak and sort of formally [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1297.84s)]
*  indicate their thought. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1303.36s)]
*  It's the first time in more than five years that they had formal talks. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1305.2s)]
*  They've had informal talks, but these were formal talks they had on the sidelines of [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1308.72s)]
*  the BRICS summit. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1311.8s)]
*  Certainly Russia, by hosting the summit, sure tried to facilitate that and was in their [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1313.64s)]
*  interest to do so. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1316.76s)]
*  It has very good relations with both countries, which is another interesting international [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1317.76s)]
*  curio that's worth watching. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1322.18s)]
*  But I think it was an extremely interesting, somewhat unexpected to outside eyes deal that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1324.8s)]
*  is a border where, to those who might recall it, back in June 2020, there was a nasty incident [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1330.94s)]
*  where basically hand to hand with heavy implements combat that resulted in deaths on both sides [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1337.06s)]
*  and a real chill in relations and suspension of commerce and diplomatic interactions and [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1343.26s)]
*  so forth. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1348.8600000000001s)]
*  And now they've come out and said, and details are still to come and those are going to be [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1349.9s)]
*  really important to watch, but this line of actual control, which is more than 2100 miles, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1353.42s)]
*  so it's incredibly big border that had involved a great deal of concern on both sides in terms [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1358.7s)]
*  of patrolling it and so forth. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1363.82s)]
*  They are now saying they will jointly patrol contested areas along this border. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1365.5800000000002s)]
*  These were what you would call confidence building measures because both sides have [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1370.9s)]
*  been building things like roads seen as the run up to seizing more territory or bringing [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1373.8600000000001s)]
*  in more military material and so forth to be able to beef up their presence and create [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1379.4s)]
*  facts on the ground for what they claim to be their place. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1384.7s)]
*  It's still a long road ahead for them to get into any sort of process where they can actually [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1387.7s)]
*  mark out an agreed upon border, but it's still an all-in-all and really important. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1390.8200000000002s)]
*  There were a number of troops that had been diverted there at a time when these countries [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1394.5s)]
*  have concerns that they would rather be spending focus on elsewhere. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1398.5s)]
*  China, certainly South China Sea, for example, India and Pakistan, as always, and they don't [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1401.5400000000002s)]
*  want to get caught up into any sort of simmering military threats on this gigantic border. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1407.14s)]
*  So I think it was a chance to use this BRICS meeting where they are both champions of the [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1413.26s)]
*  global south and have really invested a lot into this movement, which is still yet to [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1417.5s)]
*  see sort of tangible outcrops as we discussed last week. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1422.9s)]
*  But still in all, I think it was important symbolically watch the fine print on terms [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1425.94s)]
*  of what they do agree on or whether they do carry forward some more formal steps. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1430.1s)]
*  But it was seen as a really big step for these two countries. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1435.1s)]
*  I was feeling better that maybe this would stabilize at least one border until you said [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1437.9s)]
*  one of the reasons they agreed on this is because they wanted to focus on other places [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1443.5s)]
*  where they were making mischief. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1447.26s)]
*  India wanted to focus on its conflict potentially with its other nuclear armed neighbor and the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1448.7s)]
*  Chinese wanted to focus on bullying everybody in the South China Sea. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1453.26s)]
*  So I had that brief moment in which I thought, yes, at least one border had less likely for [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1457.34s)]
*  a confrontation until- Sorry to be a fly in the eye, but- [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1461.98s)]
*  And that's our look at the world next week, BRIC by BRIC. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1466.3799999999999s)]
*  Here's some other stories to keep an eye on. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1470.54s)]
*  The year of elections marches on with votes held in Kiribati, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Uruguay, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1472.46s)]
*  Botswana and Uzbekistan. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1478.22s)]
*  And India celebrates Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1480.06s)]
*  And this is Carla Robbins saying so long. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1532.46s)]
*  And this is Bob McMahon saying goodbye and please be careful out there. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1pz4Jo_FI&t=1534.54s)]
