# Turmoil in South Korea, French Government Collapses, Syrian Rebels Reignite Conflict, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU)
*  In the coming week, South Korean lawmakers vote on whether to impeach President Yun after his aborted martial law attempt. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=0.0s)]
*  France struggles with political chaos after a no-confidence vote in its prime minister, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=6.3s)]
*  even as it celebrates the reopening of Notre Dame, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=9.9s)]
*  and Syrian rebels continue their surprise offensive after seizing Aleppo. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=12.3s)]
*  It's December 5th, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=16.6s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=31.0s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=33.0s)]
*  Bob, let's start with South Korea. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=35.0s)]
*  This is both a frightening and really reassuring story because people and democracy won. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=37.5s)]
*  This past Tuesday, December 3rd, South Korean President Yun suddenly announced he was imposing martial law. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=44.0s)]
*  I mean, we still don't know where this came from. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=50.0s)]
*  And the speech he gave was extraordinary. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=52.5s)]
*  He began with what he said was a feeling of, quote, spitting blood. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=54.5s)]
*  He called the National Assembly a monster. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=59.0s)]
*  He blamed it for paralyzing the nation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=61.5s)]
*  And he said that martial law was necessary to, quote, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=63.5s)]
*  defend the country from the threats of North Korean communist forces [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=66.0s)]
*  and to eradicate the shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=70.0s)]
*  Immediately after the declaration, mass protests broke out, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=75.0s)]
*  and within hours, the National Assembly voted unanimously, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=78.5s)]
*  including everyone in his party, to overturn his declaration. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=81.5s)]
*  The Assembly summoned top military leaders to testify on their role in the affair [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=86.0s)]
*  and now plans to hold this impeachment vote. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=90.5s)]
*  Is President Yun on his way out? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=92.5s)]
*  And what does this say about the strength of democracy in South Korea? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=94.5s)]
*  Well, in the first one, it certainly would appear that way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=98.5s)]
*  We've already had an important cabinet resignation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=101.5s)]
*  Defense Minister Kim Jong-un has resigned, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=104.5s)]
*  and he was replaced right away with a retired general, Choi Byung-hook, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=107.5s)]
*  who's the South Korea's ambassador to Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=111.5s)]
*  And that's one of the casualties of the way this whole thing came about. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=114.5s)]
*  The impeachment vote still looks like, as we sat down to tape this, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=118.5s)]
*  and by the way, we're going to be saying that a lot today [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=122.0s)]
*  because it's an incredibly fluid news week, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=123.5s)]
*  but it seems like the impeachment vote is due to take place. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=125.5s)]
*  And South Korea is no stranger to this process, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=128.5s)]
*  and we've seen in the past that it can be up to a three-month or so process [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=130.5s)]
*  while something like this plays out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=134.5s)]
*  But as we're going to get into in this discussion, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=136.5s)]
*  this is both a chaotic and a resilient democracy at the same time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=138.5s)]
*  Where it's coming from really quickly, we'll just add that the backdrop is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=143.5s)]
*  an inability to get through what President Yun saw as priority legislation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=147.5s)]
*  The country's economy has been in a bad way. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=152.5s)]
*  He's been trying to address a really severe housing crisis, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=155.5s)]
*  cutting corporate taxes, trying to overhaul a national pension system. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=158.5s)]
*  There is a standoff that's been playing out with doctors in the country, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=162.5s)]
*  and he has suffered electoral setbacks repeatedly, including in April of this year. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=166.5s)]
*  And on top of that, there was a corruption scandal involving his wife. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=171.5s)]
*  So you have an unpopular president who's seemingly unable to get through important legislation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=175.5s)]
*  And as some analysts have said, conjuring up the threat of North Korea [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=180.5s)]
*  is a tried and true practice of years past of, let's say, autocratically minded leaders past. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=184.5s)]
*  The thing that makes this a bit shocking in so many ways, but also a bit concerning [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=190.5s)]
*  is the fact that Yun has been a very staunch ally to the U.S. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=195.5s)]
*  and has played a big role in strengthening his trilateral relationship with Japan and the United States. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=199.5s)]
*  He's also gone as far as providing material to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=205.5s)]
*  And a lot of that is now in question in terms of a policy from the government [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=210.5s)]
*  in that the opposition looks poised to be able to advance after this episode [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=215.5s)]
*  because of the real losing of face in this six-hour gamut. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=220.5s)]
*  And by the way, I would refer readers to, if they want an entertaining first-person account [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=223.5s)]
*  of what played out, there's a piece in The Verge called The Six Hours Under Martial Law, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=228.5s)]
*  which is a bit of a humorous but realistic look at the way a U.S. citizen who was visiting Seoul [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=233.5s)]
*  during the martial law attempt tried to sort out what was happening while being drunk. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=239.5s)]
*  I'm sure her mother is very proud of that experience. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=244.5s)]
*  So take a look and see what you think. But back to your question about the democracy, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=247.5s)]
*  it was an incredible sign of resilience. I mean, we have an interesting analysis on the website [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=251.5s)]
*  of the events that night by an expert named John Deluri who mentioned that when this all played out, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=256.5s)]
*  it was clear that Yoon had not consulted his own cabinet, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=262.5s)]
*  which was a violation of procedure for declaring martial law. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=265.5s)]
*  It requires, quote, deliberation by the State Council, end quote. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=268.5s)]
*  He didn't alert his prime minister, who becomes acting president in extraordinary situations. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=271.5s)]
*  He did not inform the United States Embassy. He did not alert U.S. forces Korea, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=276.5s)]
*  which is part of a linchpin alliance, as the author said, would be indirectly implicated [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=280.5s)]
*  in any sort of martial law. So all these certain steps were not observed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=285.5s)]
*  It seemed like he thought he could shut down with a late night announcement, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=288.5s)]
*  could block any attempt to, by the National Assembly, to move against it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=291.5s)]
*  But he was wrong. People came in, lawmakers came in, defying the martial law, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=296.5s)]
*  defying a military presence that had been mustered, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=300.5s)]
*  and was able to vote emphatically and unanimously against the measure, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=303.5s)]
*  such that within six hours he basically stood down on the martial law declaration. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=308.5s)]
*  And now we're wondering how this is going to play out in terms of his own future [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=312.5s)]
*  and how an impeachment will play out. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=316.5s)]
*  So it's a fascinating alarming, but also, as you say, Carla, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=319.5s)]
*  a bit encouraging because the people had a chance to respond, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=322.5s)]
*  and they responded immediately and emphatically. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=325.5s)]
*  And democracy lives another day in South Korea. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=328.5s)]
*  Well, South Korea, of course, has relatively recent, although most of the people live, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=330.5s)]
*  don't remember it, experience with really brutal martial law. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=334.5s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=338.5s)]
*  But we've seen this in a lot of other countries when presidents are in power [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=340.5s)]
*  and try to keep themselves in power, try to seize extraordinary powers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=343.5s)]
*  But it only works if the military and the police are with you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=347.5s)]
*  And we still don't completely understand how that broke down, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=351.5s)]
*  but they did summon some of the military leaders already for an accounting of it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=356.5s)]
*  And I was reading this morning that the South Korean general [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=361.5s)]
*  whom you named the martial law commander, he was testifying. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=364.5s)]
*  He said he only learned of the move when you announced it on television. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=368.5s)]
*  Surprise, you're in charge of this really awful thing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=372.5s)]
*  And he said he didn't know who had ordered the troops who were cordoning off the assembly [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=375.5s)]
*  or trying to head off any possible vote. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=380.5s)]
*  And then the deputy defense minister came in and said that the defense minister had ordered the troops, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=383.5s)]
*  and this is the same defense minister who has now resigned. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=387.5s)]
*  It will be really interesting to find out in the next few days how the troops split, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=391.5s)]
*  whether there was a split within the troops. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=396.5s)]
*  But it's so essential for a democracy to assert the civilian control over the military. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=398.5s)]
*  The way you're describing it, it's almost as if he did this on a whim, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=403.5s)]
*  that he didn't really get his ducks in a row. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=407.5s)]
*  And thank God he didn't. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=410.5s)]
*  Yeah, and it does show, though, I mean, really close Korea watchers on the one hand took a step back, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=412.5s)]
*  but on the other hand said, I get it, because they've been following this stuff very closely, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=417.5s)]
*  much more closely than a world that has been obsessed with take your pick in wars and crises [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=421.5s)]
*  and US transitions and so forth. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=426.5s)]
*  But in fact, the situation has been deteriorating in South Korea in terms of them trying to get anything done [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=428.5s)]
*  and increasingly unpopular leader. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=433.5s)]
*  And so it came to a head. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=435.5s)]
*  And I think it is that the recent brush with this type of behavior at the top [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=436.5s)]
*  maybe made it seem like a more palatable option. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=441.5s)]
*  But the people emphatically just said, no, no way, this is not happening anymore. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=443.5s)]
*  Well, political paralysis, and we're going to get on to that in France, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=448.5s)]
*  political paralysis seems to be part of what's going on in so many places around the world. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=451.5s)]
*  But the alternative, suspending democracy, is obviously even worse. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=457.5s)]
*  And the Korean people spoke. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=462.5s)]
*  And it's, again, just to point out the bigger ramification, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=464.5s)]
*  it is going to have consequences for defense policy, security policy, relations with North Korea potentially. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=466.5s)]
*  And North Korea has been on this trajectory on its own of being much more aggressive [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=473.5s)]
*  and really solidifying a dangerous partnership with Russia. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=477.5s)]
*  So there's a lot at stake here that South Korea is able to kind of put things back together [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=480.5s)]
*  and then work on its security posture in the midst of all this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=485.5s)]
*  So stay tuned. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=489.5s)]
*  More to come on that front that you didn't think you needed to cover. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=490.5s)]
*  Well, the good news is democracy has triumphed. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=493.5s)]
*  Well, let's talk about one of the oldest democracies, Carla, and that would be la Belle France. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=495.5s)]
*  The famous Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris is going to reopen this Saturday, December 7th, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=500.5s)]
*  five years after it caught fire. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=505.5s)]
*  This is a moment of celebration, to be sure, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=507.5s)]
*  but it's also a moment fraught with all sorts of political tension. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=510.5s)]
*  Just yesterday, far-right and far-left lawmakers backed a no-confidence vote [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=513.5s)]
*  that basically collapsed Prime Minister Michel Barnier's government. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=519.5s)]
*  This is the first time a French government has lost a vote of no confidence since 1962. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=522.5s)]
*  So we'll talk about Notre Dame and that incredible achievement, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=527.5s)]
*  but also can you talk a little bit about what's going to happen on the French political succession front? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=530.5s)]
*  Well, let's talk about the good news first. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=536.5s)]
*  I'm in a good news mood today. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=538.5s)]
*  Let's go for it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=540.5s)]
*  So we all remember watching an utter horror in April of 2019 as Notre Dame burned, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=541.5s)]
*  and remember that main spire collapsing and destroying this 12th century wooden roof. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=546.5s)]
*  But I didn't know until I started researching this this week [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=551.5s)]
*  how close the whole cathedral came to being destroyed. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=554.5s)]
*  It took this extraordinary courage and strategizing by the firefighters [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=557.5s)]
*  to prevent the North Tower, which has those enormous bells in it from burning [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=562.5s)]
*  and then crashing into the South Tower and bringing down the whole structure. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=566.5s)]
*  And when we think about how we lost the World Trade Center and came down that hard, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=569.5s)]
*  can you imagine if they'd lost Notre Dame that way? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=575.5s)]
*  But the damage was still devastating. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=578.5s)]
*  But within two days, Macron was out there vowing that Notre Dame would be rebuilt, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=581.5s)]
*  more beautiful than before within five years. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=585.5s)]
*  And in those days, he was considerably more popular than he is now. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=588.5s)]
*  But even then, the claim was seen as utterly vainglorious, if not delusional. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=592.5s)]
*  But they missed the deadline only by a few months, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=597.5s)]
*  and I think they get a little bit of wiggle room because of COVID. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=600.5s)]
*  And it was financed by private donations, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=604.5s)]
*  nearly a billion dollars raised from more than 300,000 donors in 150 countries [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=606.5s)]
*  after the French Americans donated the most to this reconstruction project, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=611.5s)]
*  yes. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=615.5s)]
*  And keep in mind the government pulled this off at the same time it was staging [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=616.5s)]
*  that pretty extraordinary Olympics. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=620.5s)]
*  So yes, the French are utterly fed up with their do-nothing government, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=622.5s)]
*  but their government did pull off two pretty extraordinary public projects there. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=626.5s)]
*  Also, I discovered that Macron, a man of infinite ambition, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=632.5s)]
*  if not particular success recently, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=637.5s)]
*  he briefly toyed with the idea of building a modern spire. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=639.5s)]
*  Did you know about this? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=642.5s)]
*  He talked about having a global competition for a modern design, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=643.5s)]
*  but that was pretty quickly dropped. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=647.5s)]
*  They settled on recreating the original design with traditional craftsmanship [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=649.5s)]
*  backed up with modern technology. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=653.5s)]
*  And that was possible because the entire cathedral had already been mapped inside [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=655.5s)]
*  and out with laser scanners. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=659.5s)]
*  So they knew how to recreate it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=660.5s)]
*  And this past week, Macron was given a tour, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=663.5s)]
*  including of this wood-floored attic where the fire broke out. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=665.5s)]
*  And he was told about each of the new wooden beams was hewed by hand, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=668.5s)]
*  just like they had been in the Middle Ages. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=672.5s)]
*  So looking at the photographs I've been able to see, it's pretty extraordinary. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=674.5s)]
*  It's that same soaring beauty just like we remember of Notre Dame, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=679.5s)]
*  but it's incredibly bright and clean because after all the soot of the fire, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=682.5s)]
*  but also hundreds of years of pollution and grime have been stripped away. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=687.5s)]
*  And it's probably what it must have looked like when it was first built, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=691.5s)]
*  you know, 800 years ago. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=694.5s)]
*  It looks extraordinary. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=696.5s)]
*  So they're going to have this official opening ceremony beginning on Saturday. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=697.5s)]
*  And while the public is not going to get to see it, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=701.5s)]
*  there are 50 heads of state and government coming, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=703.5s)]
*  including Joe Biden and President Trump. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=705.5s)]
*  And Macron, of course, was the Trump whisperer for a while in the first Trump term. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=708.5s)]
*  And he invited the president for that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=713.5s)]
*  So at least they get to see it and we'll all get more pictures as well. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=715.5s)]
*  So that's the good news. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=718.5s)]
*  Political troubles? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=720.5s)]
*  Shall we do that one? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=721.5s)]
*  Sure. I'll just say briefly on Notre Dame, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=723.5s)]
*  really looking forward to seeing the revised version, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=725.5s)]
*  but I'm also really happy I saw back in the 1980s the previous version [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=728.5s)]
*  and did note the years of soot and things, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=732.5s)]
*  but it also was just a staggering experience to go through there [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=735.5s)]
*  and see the rose window for the first time and everything. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=738.5s)]
*  So I just, it is a great story. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=740.5s)]
*  And for all the destruction, neither the organ nor the stained glass windows [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=743.5s)]
*  were destroyed in the fire. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=747.5s)]
*  I mean, that miraculous in it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=749.5s)]
*  I mean, it's covered in toxic ash and all that, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=751.5s)]
*  but those things were not destroyed. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=754.5s)]
*  It looks dazzlingly white in the picture, so lots to see there. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=756.5s)]
*  So the political troubles. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=761.5s)]
*  And it doesn't look like Macron's getting a lot of credit [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=763.5s)]
*  for having pulled these things off. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=765.5s)]
*  You know, France is in deep political and economic trouble. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=767.5s)]
*  His prime minister, Barnier, got this vote of no confidence, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=770.5s)]
*  and once he resides, he's going to enter the Google search [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=773.5s)]
*  as the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=776.5s)]
*  And what happened, the proximate issue here is they have this constitution [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=780.5s)]
*  in which they can force through an austerity budget or any budget [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=784.5s)]
*  without even a vote, and Macron has used this before, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=788.5s)]
*  you know, with the pension and all that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=792.5s)]
*  But what the legislature can do is that they can do this vote of no confidence, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=794.5s)]
*  bring a government down. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=798.5s)]
*  Now, what Barnier was arguing is that they have this huge deficit, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=800.5s)]
*  a 6.1% of GDP, and he was warning that the country's spending more [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=803.5s)]
*  on their debt than on defense and basic things like higher education. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=807.5s)]
*  And the financial markets are hugely unhappy with France, and so is Brussels. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=812.5s)]
*  But the legislators were unpersuaded. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=816.5s)]
*  And as you said, the left, this coalition left and the far right, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=819.5s)]
*  joined together to vote Barnier out. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=823.5s)]
*  They are paralyzed politically, and Macron bears a good deal of the blame for that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=827.5s)]
*  This legislative stalemate is of his doing. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=831.5s)]
*  We talked a lot about this at the time after Marine Le Pen's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=834.5s)]
*  national rally did so well in the parliament elections in May. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=837.5s)]
*  Macron called those snap parliamentary elections, and while... [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=840.5s)]
*  In the Euro-parliament election. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=844.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=845.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=846.5s)]
*  And then he called the snap elections back in France, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=847.5s)]
*  and what ended up happening is they managed to hold off Le Pen's people, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=850.5s)]
*  but they have this parliament that's divided in thirds, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=854.5s)]
*  and they can't get anything done. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=857.5s)]
*  And that's where they are right now. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=859.5s)]
*  All of them seem to be implacable enemies, each block. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=861.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=863.5s)]
*  And so what's going to happen now? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=864.5s)]
*  Under the constitution, they can't hold another election until next summer. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=866.5s)]
*  Macron, whose own term is not up until 2027, is refusing calls to step down. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=870.5s)]
*  I will say that he is giving a speech today. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=876.5s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=879.5s)]
*  Maybe you will be utterly surprised, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=880.5s)]
*  but I don't think that ego is going to let him step down, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=881.5s)]
*  and I'm not even sure what that would change if he did. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=884.5s)]
*  France does have a possibility that they can continue with the current budget. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=886.5s)]
*  I suppose their version of a CR itself. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=892.5s)]
*  So it's unlikely to be a shutdown, at least in some of the things I've read, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=894.5s)]
*  but this political upheaval and ultimately the stalemate is unlikely to go away [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=898.5s)]
*  until they get around to having another election, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=902.5s)]
*  which can't happen, I think, until next July. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=905.5s)]
*  And meanwhile, they have a budget problem that has not been solved, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=908.5s)]
*  and it's posing a lot of concern and could have knock-on effects. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=911.5s)]
*  One other interesting subplot in all this is that in the midst of the French crisis [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=915.5s)]
*  and inability to act, the European officials are trekking off [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=920.5s)]
*  to try to seal a deal on America's trade agreement in South America [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=924.5s)]
*  that France was very heavily opposed to. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=928.5s)]
*  It just shows political dysfunction at home can have all sorts of consequences abroad as well. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=930.5s)]
*  Well, and when you consider President Trump is coming in, he is no fan of Europe. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=935.5s)]
*  He's really no fan of the EU itself. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=940.5s)]
*  And unlike the last time around when he was in and he had Angela Merkel [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=943.5s)]
*  and he had a much stronger Macron there, there are no strong leaders. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=947.5s)]
*  Germany's facing elections in February. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=952.5s)]
*  Macron obviously much more wounded than he was before. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=954.5s)]
*  There's really nobody, there's no interlocutor for Trump here. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=958.5s)]
*  There's nobody to challenge him here, and they're really big problems. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=961.5s)]
*  These are the two biggest European economies, and then not to mention the UK, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=964.5s)]
*  which is no longer in the EU, but also has a new government. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=968.5s)]
*  So it's an incredibly tricky time, a time of opportunity for the Trump administration. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=971.5s)]
*  And you've got Ukraine, and you've got the threats of tariffs, and all sorts of things. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=976.5s)]
*  So I think probably the most important thing here right now is that [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=982.5s)]
*  if Macron is going to focus on anything, he should probably enjoy the Notre Dame celebration this weekend. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=986.5s)]
*  It's probably the happiest thing that's going to happen to him for months to come. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=992.5s)]
*  Bob, let's move on to another extraordinary story. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=995.5s)]
*  This is an incredible week for you. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=998.5s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1000.5s)]
*  Let's talk about Syria, where we thought Bashar al-Assad had brutally ended the civil war, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1001.5s)]
*  basically turned his own country into rubble. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1007.5s)]
*  On Saturday, out of what we weren't paying enough attention, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1010.5s)]
*  this rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, suddenly seized one of the country's largest cities, Aleppo. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1014.5s)]
*  And today, Thursday, December 5th, the group took the city of Hama, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1020.5s)]
*  which is about 130 miles north of Damascus, the capital, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1024.5s)]
*  and announced they have now set their sights on another important city, Homs, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1027.5s)]
*  which lies on this critical north-south highway. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1032.5s)]
*  This is moving incredibly fast. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1034.5s)]
*  Is Assad in danger of losing control of the country? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1037.5s)]
*  And is at least part of his problem here, and it couldn't happen to a nicer guy, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1040.5s)]
*  is that his main backers, Iran and Russia, have their sights on other problems, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1045.5s)]
*  you know, with the wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and Lebanon? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1050.5s)]
*  That latter part certainly seems to be a precipitating factor. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1053.5s)]
*  Carla definitely has been weak and was a major supporter of Assad in crunch time in the earlier years of the civil war. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1056.5s)]
*  And the Iranian IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1063.5s)]
*  also I think has been preoccupied as Iran has been trading blows with Israel this year, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1067.5s)]
*  which has been unprecedented as well. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1073.5s)]
*  And then Russia obviously heavily involved in Ukraine, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1075.5s)]
*  not having the firepower nearby that it had when it brutally suppressed the rebellion in Aleppo in particular. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1078.5s)]
*  We have seen some response by Iranian and Russian sides, especially Russian air power, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1085.5s)]
*  and it was significant that one of the first things they did was bomb hospitals in Idlib and northwestern Syria, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1091.5s)]
*  hearkening back to their deliberate targeting of soft targets and civilians to put down the rebellion. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1096.5s)]
*  Then it's not clear that that is going to have much staying power and how much more they can bring to bear here [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1102.5s)]
*  as these forces continue to move south. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1108.5s)]
*  What's also challenging in this moment, our colleague Stephen Cook pointed out in an early analysis for us on the website, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1111.5s)]
*  was that there's not a lot of original reporting, independent reporting in Syria. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1116.5s)]
*  It's a really dangerous place, for one thing. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1121.5s)]
*  There are some monitoring organizations that are able to sort of send along third-hand reports from various places. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1124.5s)]
*  So the reliability of reporting is sketchy, but clearly this group, which goes by the acronym HTS, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1130.5s)]
*  has rebuilt itself, possibly with considerable help or at least a looking the other way approach from Turkey, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1137.5s)]
*  since Turkey controls a region right near that border in northwestern Syria. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1143.5s)]
*  And Turkey might have found that to be convenient because it allowed it to, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1148.5s)]
*  at the same time this offensive happened, to move in and push out Kurdish forces that were in the region as well. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1151.5s)]
*  Turkey's job one continues to be to focus on eradicating any threat from the PKK-affiliated forces in northern Syria. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1157.5s)]
*  So what is Turkey going to do in all this? There was a lot of diplomatic activity going on, not clear yet. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1165.5s)]
*  There might be some movement towards getting sides back to a peace process, which has been totally dormant for a while. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1170.5s)]
*  But HTS might also have such wind in its sails, and it's not clear where they're getting all this firepower and the support, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1176.5s)]
*  but certainly the brutal record of the government, including using chemical weapons, including documented cases of torture, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1183.5s)]
*  and also sort of backing itself up with some sort of gangster trade and drugs, all of these things have made it incredibly unpopular. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1190.5s)]
*  HTS had been affiliated with al-Qaeda, it's on the US terrorist list still, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1197.5s)]
*  but HTS is trying to rebrand itself and projecting an image of being a softer alternative for Syrian people to turn to. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1201.5s)]
*  What's going to be interesting as it moves south, if it gets near Homs, is it's moving into areas that are not Muslim, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1208.5s)]
*  that are Christian in particular, and see how it performs in those areas as well. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1212.5s)]
*  And so this is all new territory again from something that we had been used to talking about in dreary fashion in the past. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1218.5s)]
*  It's now new. And let's remember, there are more than six million or so Syrian refugees still from the earlier fighting. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1224.5s)]
*  There were estimated 300 to 600,000 deaths from the previous fighting in Syria. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1231.5s)]
*  This is a bloody, horrible war, 10 to 12 million displaced within Syria. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1236.5s)]
*  So the country can ill afford another chapter like that. The region can ill afford it, frankly, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1241.5s)]
*  but it shows things don't happen in a vacuum in the Middle East. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1245.5s)]
*  Israeli activity has seemed to create an opportunity for this group that certainly the Israelis are not aligned with, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1247.5s)]
*  but maybe it'll be interesting to see how the Israelis respond if HTS continues to gain traction. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1252.5s)]
*  So we really don't know what, if HTS were to take over, could they be worse potentially? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1258.5s)]
*  We don't know, exactly. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1263.5s)]
*  It's hard to imagine anybody being worse than the Assad's. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1264.5s)]
*  But remember, this is a country where the Islamic State, the so-called Islamic State, took a big swath of territory [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1267.5s)]
*  and did brutal, awful things before US-aligned Kurdish forces, which still control some territory. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1272.5s)]
*  And we can go on and on. It's extremely complicated. It's worth also mentioning there are 900 US forces still based in southern Syria. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1278.5s)]
*  In the first Trump administration, he had tried to withdraw all forces, was persuaded to keep some. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1285.5s)]
*  And whether or not he wants to continue that, that's another test for the incoming Trump administration. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1290.5s)]
*  So stay tuned. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1295.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1296.5s)]
*  Carla, we have talked our way into the audience figure of the week part of the podcast. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1297.5s)]
*  This is the figure that listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's Instagram story. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1304.5s)]
*  This week, the audience selected Trump threatens 100 percent tariffs on BRICS nations. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1310.5s)]
*  Why is Trump targeting the BRICS? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1316.5s)]
*  I think we're going to need a scorecard to keep track of all the... [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1318.5s)]
*  Tariff scorecard? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1321.5s)]
*  Yes, a tariff and target scorecard. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1322.5s)]
*  Tariff tracker. I like that. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1325.5s)]
*  So let's remember that this came after former and future President Trump threatened our two closest trading partners, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1326.5s)]
*  Mexico and Canada, countries with which we have a free trade agreement that President Trump negotiated. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1333.5s)]
*  He threatened them with a 25 percent tariff on day one, quote, until such time as drugs, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1339.5s)]
*  and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1345.5s)]
*  So we've been in tariff fast for a while here. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1348.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the BRICS thing is a big deal, but nowhere near as big deal as the other one. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1351.5s)]
*  So as for the BRICS, in a post on Truth Social on November 30th, President Trump said, quote, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1356.5s)]
*  the idea that BRICS countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by and watch is all uppercase over. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1362.5s)]
*  He added that either these countries commit to not creating a new BRICS currency or backing any other currency [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1369.5s)]
*  to replace the mighty U.S. dollar, they're going to face 100 percent tariffs. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1375.5s)]
*  They can go and find another sucker. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1379.5s)]
*  He's really good on social media. Whoever's writing him is really persuasive. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1382.5s)]
*  Who knew that you could do currency and still have the word sucker all at the same time? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1386.5s)]
*  So we've talked before about why Russia, China, Brazil seem to want to create an alternative currency [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1392.5s)]
*  and reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1398.5s)]
*  For Russia, but China in particular, it's a way to reduce U.S. geopolitical influence [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1401.5s)]
*  as well as the U.S. ability to pressure countries by denying access to dollars and the dollar trade. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1406.5s)]
*  It's not all that surprising. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1411.5s)]
*  And having our own currency as well as we know also lowers our borrowing costs and brings us a lot of prestige. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1414.5s)]
*  So you can understand why other countries would be tempted by it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1420.5s)]
*  Putin declared at the BRICS summit in October, quote, the dollar is being used as a weapon. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1423.5s)]
*  He certainly knows that. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1428.5s)]
*  And the Brazilians have been interested in the prestige aspect of it for a long time. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1430.5s)]
*  They've been pushing it. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1434.5s)]
*  And that brings us to the next question. Would a new BRICS currency truly threaten the dollar? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1436.5s)]
*  The reality of it is that there's almost no chance this is going to happen. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1441.5s)]
*  The dollar is the world's main reserve currency. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1444.5s)]
*  For all of the hand-wringing that's come, that sanctions are going to undermine the dollar, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1447.5s)]
*  for all of the ideas of the BRICS that they're going to create one, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1451.5s)]
*  it still makes up about 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1455.5s)]
*  Critical commodities are still traded mainly in dollars. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1459.5s)]
*  And pretty much everyone says that it's really unlikely that the BRICS are anywhere near close to, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1462.5s)]
*  and certainly given what we know about the Russian economy, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1468.5s)]
*  would anybody really want anything that was backed by Russia? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1471.5s)]
*  If they were to place tariffs on these countries, you know, once again, we all know what tariffs are. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1475.5s)]
*  Tariffs are taxes on consumers. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1480.5s)]
*  So it would drive up the cost of imports from BRICS nations. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1482.5s)]
*  And more than anything else, I think the best take on this comes from our colleague, Brad Stetzer. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1485.5s)]
*  And I'm going to read a long quote, but it's really great. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1491.5s)]
*  He, too, was very good on this on social media. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1494.5s)]
*  Curious how former President-elect Trump ever became convinced [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1496.5s)]
*  that the nowhere close to happening BRICS currency was a threat to the dollar. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1500.5s)]
*  It isn't a good look as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1504.5s)]
*  and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1509.5s)]
*  In other words, why are we even worrying about this? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1512.5s)]
*  Well, it elevates the stature of the BRICS group, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1515.5s)]
*  which has been kind of reading its own press releases the past year and is high on itself, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1518.5s)]
*  but it's still, the verdict is still out on what it really adds up to [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1522.5s)]
*  other than a, you know, a platform for these countries to vent against the U.S. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1525.5s)]
*  And these countries also include first-while U.S. partners like India, you know. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1529.5s)]
*  So where does India figure into all this? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1533.5s)]
*  I think it's just in the Saudis now, right, with the expanded BRICS. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1535.5s)]
*  Although it should be noted Argentina was invited and said, no, thanks. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1538.5s)]
*  And Argentina is trying to cozy up. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1541.5s)]
*  Right. And their currency is so stable anyway. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1544.5s)]
*  Yes. Let's not get going on that currency front. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1547.5s)]
*  But yeah, it's a great quote. I saw that quote from Brad as well. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1551.5s)]
*  And it's just signaling in every direction seemingly at this point. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1555.5s)]
*  It's pretty remarkable to see still almost two months out [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1558.5s)]
*  the sway and the impact that Trump is having around the world right now. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1562.5s)]
*  And apparently there are a number of officials kind of trooping into the U.S., [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1566.5s)]
*  Washington and Florida and Mar-a-Lago to make sure that they get their dibs in [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1570.5s)]
*  and are able to take a meeting and present their cases and everything else. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1575.5s)]
*  So it's just another sign Trump is taking on all comers. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1579.5s)]
*  And tariffs, what did he say? It was one of the most beautiful? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1582.5s)]
*  One of the most beautiful words. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1585.5s)]
*  One of the most beautiful words. So get your tariff scorecard now. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1587.5s)]
*  There will be no excuse for people not to know what tariffs are after the next couple of months. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDefitXQMvU&t=1590.5s)]
