# Ukraine Pushes Peace Summit, Sudan in Catastrophe, Israel-Hamas Deal at a Crossroads, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0)
*  In the coming week, a Ukraine peace summit takes place in Switzerland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=0.0s)]
*  The UN Security Council discusses civil war ravage in Sudan and diplomatic pressure mounts [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=3.84s)]
*  for Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire deal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=8.88s)]
*  It's June 13, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=11.76s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=27.04s)]
*  And I'm Carly Anne Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=28.0s)]
*  Carla, let's go to Switzerland. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=30.24s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=31.76s)]
*  You know, Switzerland is a venue for all sorts of internationally-minded organizations. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=32.48s)]
*  But this week, at the behest of President Zelensky of Ukraine, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=37.12s)]
*  it is going to be host to a peace summit. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=40.88s)]
*  And there will be issues like nuclear safety, food security, possible prison exchanges discussed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=43.84s)]
*  But Russia, which is the other main party in the Ukraine-Russia war, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=49.44s)]
*  is not going to be in attendance. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=53.6s)]
*  So can there be a peace conference without Moscow at the table? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=55.84s)]
*  And what should we expect from the summit? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=59.6s)]
*  Bob, this peace summit in Switzerland is just one of several meetings that are happening [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=61.84s)]
*  this week and in coming days that shift the focus back to Ukraine and its future. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  And it started off actually earlier this week in Berlin with the Ukraine Recovery Conference, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=71.12s)]
*  which sought to rally investment for 95 long-range projects, and also to talk about [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=76.32s)]
*  reform targets, which seemed pretty important for Ukraine. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=82.08s)]
*  And then the G7, which begins today, Thursday, and runs through Saturday in Italy, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  is expected to finally come up with an agreement on how to leverage $300 million in frozen Russian [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  funds, which are in European, mainly Belgian, banks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=96.32s)]
*  The Biden administration, we've talked about this before, has been pushing to turn [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  all of that money over to Ukraine for defense and financial needs and some reconstruction. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=103.36s)]
*  And the European bankers have been balking, claiming it's a violation of international law, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  and undoubtedly bad for their business. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=113.44s)]
*  The Europeans wanted to give the Ukrainians the interest, and that's just only about $3 billion [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=116.32s)]
*  a year. And the Americans have been arguing that that's not enough. And the compromise, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=120.8s)]
*  and we're probably going to find out about this maybe even before the podcast drops, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=125.6s)]
*  but the compromise they appeared to have agreed on, the G7 countries will loan Ukraine roughly [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=129.76s)]
*  $50 billion, and this loan will be backed by the future interest earned on the frozen Russian [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=134.0s)]
*  assets. At this G7 meeting, the leaders are also expected to discuss what they can do to stop China [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=139.44s)]
*  from selling so-called dual-use technology to Russia, including microelectronics and software [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=144.56s)]
*  needed to build weapons systems, drones, and air defenses. So there's going to be a lot of focus on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=150.8s)]
*  what to do now as well as focus on reconstruction and money. So after a lot of discussion of Gaza [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  and something we're going to get into as well, there is going to be this shift. And then [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=161.84s)]
*  toward the end of the week, there is this peace conference in Switzerland, and you've raised a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=166.56s)]
*  really basic question. How can there be a peace conference without the Russians at the table? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=171.36s)]
*  This was something that Zelensky very much wanted. The Swiss say that Zelensky wouldn't have showed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=177.04s)]
*  up if the Russians were there, and they see this as creating some sort of format for eventually, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=182.56s)]
*  a platform, a format eventually for a peace discussion. What the Ukrainians want is they [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  want an endorsement. They want as many countries possibly to show up. Zelensky's been pushing to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=198.0s)]
*  have more global south countries at the table. And so far, what we know is 160 invitations went out, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=203.28s)]
*  some 80 countries, but they haven't published the attendee list, are supposed to be there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=210.88s)]
*  And that list of things that they are going to be talking about are nuclear security and the need [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=216.0s)]
*  for free navigation and the exchange of captives and return of illegally deported children. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=224.08s)]
*  The Ukrainians' argument is who could possibly disagree with this? And they're hoping that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  South Africa and Brazil and Turkey and all those fence-sitters are potentially going to send leaders, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  if not the very top leaders, some senior officials, to show that Ukraine has more support. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=238.8s)]
*  We know that Macron is going to go. We know that Olaf Schultz is going to go. We know that Joe [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=246.72s)]
*  Biden isn't going to go. He's going to a fundraiser, but Kamala Harris will be there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=250.56s)]
*  And the Ukrainians may say these are pretty, who could possibly disagree with these topics? But [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  if you look at them, let's face it, if you talk about free navigation, if you talk about nuclear [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=260.16s)]
*  security, if you talk about the exchange of captives, the Russians aren't going to look [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  very good, which is why the Russians have been lobbying so hard to keep countries [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=267.76s)]
*  away from this meeting. So we'll have to watch it. Zelensky, he's a pretty incredible diplomat for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=271.44s)]
*  his country. And he was out there even at the Shangri-La dialogue, lobbying really hard. We [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=277.2s)]
*  know the Indians have said they're going to come, but we'll see once again what level they send people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=282.08s)]
*  0.5 [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=285.84s)]
*  Karl, I wonder how much of this, in addition to whatever substantively comes out, how much of this [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  is just another effort from Zelensky to try to boost morale at a time when Russia has generally [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=292.08s)]
*  been said to have seized the initiative with all these, certainly with the step up in shelling and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=298.96s)]
*  missile launching and adapted missile launches and so forth, that Zelensky's trying to convey [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=305.36s)]
*  to his people, the rest of the world is talking about this and is involved in this and is trying [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=310.4s)]
*  to play a role as opposed to like, it's just all going in the bad direction. Is that also play a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=316.08s)]
*  role or am I overstating that? Well, certainly they need any good news. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  And Ukraine's current situation is really grim. Russia is continuing to launch missiles and drones [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=327.52s)]
*  used to keep just the other day itself. And Russian forces are continuing to press really hard. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=333.44s)]
*  So any act of solidarity is certainly welcome. And President Biden just today is also going to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  make a commitment for a 10-year security deal. Assuming he's re-elected, he won't be able to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=345.2s)]
*  keep it for four years. We'll see if President Trump is elected. And perhaps the thing that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=350.88s)]
*  the Ukrainian civilians, even if they're not in the direct line of fire, have Ukraine's electrical [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=357.04s)]
*  generating capacity has been destroyed by Russian attacks, much of it just in the recent months. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=362.72s)]
*  And the country's experiencing major power cuts and people are wondering what's going to be like [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  in the coming winter. That said, there is some good news just as the US aid is finally flowing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=372.24s)]
*  These attacks on Kiev in the last day or so, they've been able to repel a lot of them. And [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=380.8s)]
*  even the mayor of Kharkiv, this is Ukraine's second city, which is on the brink of falling [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=386.64s)]
*  just a few weeks ago. The mayor of Kharkiv was at that Berlin conference and he told Reuters that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=391.44s)]
*  Western weapons and this permission to use these weapons against Russian targets close to the border [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  had actually slowed the Russian assault down. So there's a small amount of good news, the sense [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=402.64s)]
*  of solidarity there, but the war is really hard and it's going to take a lot more support. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  But the sense of solidarity is really important. And more than anything else, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=415.6s)]
*  getting a lot more patriots there, which are also coming, is certainly absolutely essential. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=420.0s)]
*  Yeah. And somewhere on the horizon potentially are these advanced aircraft that are said to be [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=424.72s)]
*  transferred at some point, although training is going to have to happen and everything else, but [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=429.76s)]
*  you are seeing potential for stepped up capabilities on the horizon. And it should be noted [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=433.44s)]
*  like Russia is burning through a lot of material. They have moved to a war economy more and more [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=440.0s)]
*  forcefully. They are clamping down against any dissent, seemingly much more vigorously. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=445.68s)]
*  So things are sort of hardening. It is going to be interesting to see how they respond to this bit of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=451.2s)]
*  financial wizardry that's going on with the G7 in terms of what sort of reprisals can they mount. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=455.04s)]
*  They've talked about seizing assets of some G7 countries that still have holdings in Russia [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=461.68s)]
*  itself. So things are getting more and more intriguing, I guess you could say, in addition [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  to more meaningful. And as Biden was leaving for Italy, Treasury announced these expanded [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=471.68s)]
*  secondary sanctions, which gives the US power to blacklist any bank. And the main targets are [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=476.88s)]
*  Chinese and Hong Kong-based banks that are facilitating these deals of these so-called [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=483.04s)]
*  dual-use items that are keeping the Russian military industrial complex going. But the US [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=487.68s)]
*  power to blacklist any bank that does business with Russian financial institutions. And there's [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=493.6s)]
*  a hope that all the G7 countries are going to follow. And what we know today is the price of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=498.72s)]
*  the dollar spiked in Russia. And the Russians have proved incredibly adaptable, moving away from [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=503.44s)]
*  getting around any sanctions that have been imposed upon them. And they've been very dependent on the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=511.36s)]
*  Chinese. And taking this focus directly to the Chinese is absolutely essential. And one thing [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=515.44s)]
*  that I read that I found really quite interesting is that the Russians have pivoted away increasingly [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=521.6s)]
*  from, quote, toxic international currencies, the EU and the dollar and the yen, and moving more and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=527.36s)]
*  more to the Chinese currency, to the renminbi. But there are some reports that they're having [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=534.4s)]
*  increasing problems getting their hands on Chinese currency because the Chinese are feeling [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=539.36s)]
*  the squeeze and are afraid that they're going to get in trouble with the global financial system. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=543.6s)]
*  So I don't want to get our hopes up here because the Russians have proved incredibly resilient [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=548.4s)]
*  militarily, incredibly resilient financially. But it's quite good to see that there's a push, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  a push on all sorts of fronts, and particularly since this military aid is flowing and more [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=559.6s)]
*  patriots are moving. So we will see if this new focus and this new push does some good for Ukraine. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=564.96s)]
*  Yeah. And it's all a new lesson in what are the levers of financial statecraft that are still [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  available and still seem to be considerable. Bob, let's head to New York, where the UN [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=577.12s)]
*  Security Council is going to hear a briefing on another extremely grim crisis, and that's one in [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  Sudan. The situation there is desperate, and since this conflict began in April of last year, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=588.48s)]
*  10 million people have been displaced, at least 15,000 killed. And in a country which is already [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=595.6s)]
*  struggling with problems of hunger, disease, ethnic gender-based violence, the horrors have [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=601.36s)]
*  only multiplied. The UN provides vital humanitarian services, although its mission has been reduced. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=606.96s)]
*  The circumstances are incredibly hard in Sudan, and it's also trying to facilitate a peace process [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=614.88s)]
*  there. What can we expect from the Security Council when it meets on Sudan next week? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=621.28s)]
*  Well, things are moving a bit fast on this front, actually, Carla, because ahead of next week, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=626.08s)]
*  as early as this afternoon, the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution that [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=630.72s)]
*  demands one of the warring sides, the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, to halt its siege of the capital [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=635.2s)]
*  of North Darfur state, which is Al Fashir. And it's expected to call for the immediate halt to [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=642.4s)]
*  fighting and for de-escalation in and around Al Fashir. And the reason for that is Darfur is, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=647.28s)]
*  unfortunately, this is a region people might recall as the center of genocide in the early [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=652.88s)]
*  aughts, 2007, 2008 in particular, and it's now teetering on that brink again. UN officials have [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=658.4s)]
*  been extremely concerned at ramping up violence in the area and the fragmentation of Darfur, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=665.52s)]
*  which is a very large chunk of territory in Western Sudan, into ethnic sectarian lines, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=671.04s)]
*  and just a great deal of concern about Arab versus African groups and so forth. And on top of that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=677.5999999999999s)]
*  all, this is happening against the backdrop of just massive population flows, but Al Fashir seems [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=684.56s)]
*  to be a particularly bad area where this is occurring. And so Security Council is, even [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=689.68s)]
*  though it has been fractious and divided and certainly divided between these major powers [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=695.28s)]
*  that we were just talking about on Ukraine, Russia, United States, China, even the Security [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=699.12s)]
*  Council seems to be seized of the need to make a strong statement as it pertains to Al Fashir. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=704.08s)]
*  Next week, there will be further discussions about the broader humanitarian state, about [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=710.0s)]
*  in particular trying to lay out the markers for how to securely provide humanitarian aid to Sudan [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=715.36s)]
*  from various border crossings, particularly Chad, because there are parts of Sudan that are teetering [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=723.2s)]
*  on the edge of famine. The numbers again, as you said at the beginning, this is the world's worst [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=728.8s)]
*  crisis if you don't consider all the other crises going on. This is certainly the most neglected [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=734.0s)]
*  major crisis in the world. And it is proving to be extremely hard to point A, which is just to stop [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=739.12s)]
*  the fighting. And that's because the two sides in part have some strong backers. The RSF has the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  backing of the UAE. The Sudan Armed Forces have the backing of the Saudis and Egypt. They also [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=753.68s)]
*  increasingly have been getting support from Russia, if rhetorical, if not otherwise. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=761.12s)]
*  And you can expect Russia to speak up at the Security Council next week about making sure that [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  any aid passageways are done through the auspices only of Sudan government-controlled places. And [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=771.8399999999999s)]
*  problem is that Sudan government forces have been in retreat in certain key areas, and it's not [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=778.32s)]
*  clear where they're going to be able to control the aid passages. So it puts the UN, which as [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=784.08s)]
*  always is the go-to humanitarian center of coordination in a very difficult spot. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=789.2s)]
*  Cindy McCain, who's the executive director of the World Food Program, just appeared at [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=794.72s)]
*  CFR earlier this week and talking about just how difficult it is to get [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=797.92s)]
*  secure corridors that are not going to be looted or UN workers held up at the point of violence [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=802.24s)]
*  to turn over their goods. There's a great deal of lawlessness going on. And so it's an extremely [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=808.48s)]
*  difficult situation. And yes, there is an attempt by parties, including the US, to try to forge some [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=815.28s)]
*  sort of a peace process. Right now, the US and Saudi efforts in particular have met with problems [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=822.16s)]
*  because the Sudanese armed forces have said they would not participate in peace talks until the RSF [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=829.12s)]
*  is decisively defeated. That seems to be far off. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=834.64s)]
*  CB So what's the point of peace talks if the other side is decisively defeated? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=837.2s)]
*  CB Yes. Good point, Carla. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=840.8s)]
*  CB Well, in the past, we've talked about all the different players who have relationships with the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=844.32s)]
*  two sides. And with the hope, I think, that they could use their leverage to at least broker some [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=850.72s)]
*  serious ceasefire here. But in your description, it seems that they're actually fanning the fighting. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=858.4000000000001s)]
*  Can we get the UAE, the Egyptians? Certainly not the Russians. I think they're providing weapons. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=865.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. Or any of these outside players, serious interlocutors for moving a peace process forward? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=869.6800000000001s)]
*  CB I think you've seized on one of the things that makes this particularly difficult because [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  you've had repeated reports that the countries that are supporting both sides in this are looking [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=878.4000000000001s)]
*  for a bit of leverage in terms of some of the spoils of supporting the different sides. So [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=884.48s)]
*  Sudan is a country with a lot of natural resources, for example, in oil and gold. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=890.48s)]
*  And there have been reports that different sides supporting the different parties are looking for [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=895.04s)]
*  access to those resources as a tradeoff for continuing to support them. So it's not clear. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=900.0s)]
*  The Wagner Group, for example, there have been reports that it has been involved in [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=907.12s)]
*  gold mining operations. And so Russia, again, has been a very strong supporter of the government [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=912.48s)]
*  forces. Wagner, though, in the past had also had connections with Hemati, who's the person who's [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  heading the RSF. There had even been reports that Wagner had supplied weapons and trading to the RSF. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=923.52s)]
*  So at the same time, you have Russian officials saying, doubling down on their support for [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=928.88s)]
*  Sudanese armed forces. So that's just one example. UAE had staked out some areas as well of influence [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=934.0s)]
*  and had been said to have been sort of trading off its support for certain concessions within [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=941.68s)]
*  Sudan. So you're going to have to get past and it's going to have to take big power, arm twisting, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=946.9599999999999s)]
*  among other things, to get involved here and to try to once and for all bring the parties to a [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=952.4s)]
*  negotiation that acknowledges that there's some competition for spoils going on. But at the end [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=957.3599999999999s)]
*  of the day, they have to bring this war to an end. It is epic what is going on in terms of humanitarian [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=962.9599999999999s)]
*  previously to the war, there were millions of people who were displaced. Now there are 10 million [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=970.2399999999999s)]
*  people displaced in Sudan. Roughly half of its population of 50 million is said to be insecure [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=974.4799999999999s)]
*  in some way. Few million have already crossed borders into other countries. So it's all to say, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=980.4s)]
*  and Africa has seen this before, regrettably, Congo comes to mind and Congo still has its problems in [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=986.2399999999999s)]
*  Eastern Congo. But there was one point where Congo had like six different countries with military [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=991.68s)]
*  forces involved. That wasn't too long ago because there were different stakes to be had. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=996.4s)]
*  And yet patient persistent diplomacy can sometimes prevail. We saw it prevail in the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1001.12s)]
*  civil war between North and South Sudan. And now there is a new nation of South Sudan, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1007.04s)]
*  which still has its own difficulties as well. But it's all a long way of saying, Carla, that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1010.9599999999999s)]
*  there are outside parties that are not helping to bring this to an end in terms of bringing it to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1017.04s)]
*  an end to finally bring peace. And there needs to be stepped up attention at a time when the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1021.92s)]
*  sad old earth is dealing with a lot of other conflicts. And we've talked about one already, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1027.92s)]
*  and it's going to have to be persistent and consistent or else this is going to devolve [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  further. Carla, let's take our conversation to Israel, not because we're going to move [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  beyond difficult war situations, but because we are at a potential inflection point because [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1042.24s)]
*  a ceasefire deal remains on the table. This past Sunday, however, Benny Gantz left [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1047.84s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war cabinet and removed his centrist national unity party [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1052.6399999999999s)]
*  from a emergency unity government that had been set up. Now without the support, Netanyahu is [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1057.28s)]
*  more dependent on far right parties and they have been more supportive of escalating military [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1062.56s)]
*  operations rather than finding a route to a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the United States and [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1068.0s)]
*  other international groups are applying pressure, although a lot of it seems to be focused on Hamas [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1072.24s)]
*  at this point saying the deal is on the table for them to accept or not. So how might Netanyahu be [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1076.48s)]
*  sort of handling this situation? What should we look for in the next step? And can you help [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1082.48s)]
*  sort through the confusion about whether or not there is actually a deal that the Israeli [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1086.96s)]
*  government supports? I've learned never to predict anything in this conflict or at least not anything [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1090.72s)]
*  hopeful. But the sequence of recent events which you were summing up look to me, at least in a [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1096.88s)]
*  contrarian way, like the best chance in a very long while for pushing through a ceasefire, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1103.36s)]
*  four hostages exchange deal. First on Saturday, Israel rescued four hostages to great rejoicing. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1109.9199999999998s)]
*  But the challenges of that rescue made clear to many in the Israeli military establishment that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1118.0s)]
*  the only way to get all of the remaining hostages out, and it's not clear how many of them are still [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1122.7199999999998s)]
*  alive, is with some sort of a ceasefire deal. Then Benny Gantz and his national unity party [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1127.28s)]
*  withdrew from Netanyahu's wartime government. And that gave Bibi a choice. He could either go full [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1134.32s)]
*  on hard right and isolate Israel from the US and a lot of his own public, or attack at least partly [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1141.2s)]
*  toward the center and embrace a ceasefire deal. To up the pressure on both Hamas and on Israel, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1147.52s)]
*  the US then on Monday went to the UN Security Council and won its banking, only Russia abstained, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1153.76s)]
*  for a ceasefire plan for Gaza. And the United States, interestingly, had vetoed three previous [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1161.52s)]
*  ceasefire resolutions and had gotten crosswise with lots of other ones there. But it clearly [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1168.32s)]
*  did this to put pressure on Hamas, but also to put pressure on Israel. If Washington is to be [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1174.24s)]
*  believed, the proposal hewed closely to what Hamas put on the table. And Washington claimed that it [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1179.52s)]
*  had already received Israel's private endorsement, but Netanyahu has yet to say so publicly. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  And nothing is easy here. On Wednesday, Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, who was on his eighth [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1192.96s)]
*  trip to the region since October 7th, said Hamas had responded to the deal and suddenly had changed [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1197.84s)]
*  its position. And some of the changes are, he said, workable, some are not. And today on Thursday, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1204.32s)]
*  at the G7, National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, said that the administration was going [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1210.72s)]
*  to keep pushing, but it didn't look like he'd made any progress. And meanwhile, once again, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1215.2s)]
*  the Israelis are still not saying that they'd committed to the deal. So what is this deal? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1219.9199999999998s)]
*  That's the one that Biden rolled out claiming it was an Israeli deal. It's three phases. First phase, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1224.8s)]
*  six-week ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and a release of [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1230.8s)]
*  elderly and female hostages in exchange for a release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1236.32s)]
*  Then a second phase, all remaining hostages released, including male soldiers, all hostilities end, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1242.1599999999999s)]
*  all Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza. And then this third phase, which is reconstruction, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1248.48s)]
*  although it's not clear who would run Gaza at that point, which is really a big deal and one [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1253.36s)]
*  of the reasons why Gantz got out and perhaps the most neurologic of issues inside the war cabinet [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1258.24s)]
*  itself. And what Hamas is reportedly demanding at this point, and it hasn't said so publicly, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1264.96s)]
*  is a full Israeli withdrawal by the end of the first phase, as well as completing, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1270.72s)]
*  quote, sustainable halt to fighting before any exchange of prisoners, which really would be [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1275.6s)]
*  completely out of step with what this supposed agreement that was on the table. What we don't [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1280.32s)]
*  know is, was this really the original Hamas deal? Did the Israelis sign on? We don't know a lot of [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1286.16s)]
*  this, but if we take the Americans at their word, the Americans still think that they can push [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1291.44s)]
*  something forward. So here are the big questions. First, the Americans have put all the pressure on [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1297.68s)]
*  Hamas. And does Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, want any deal? I think that's a pretty [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1303.3600000000001s)]
*  legitimate question here. Hamas has agreed to a brief ceasefire late last year, during which more [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1309.44s)]
*  than a hundred hostages in Gaza were freed and many more Palestinian prisoners and Israeli [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1315.2s)]
*  prisons were exchanged. And Sinwar is believed to be hiding in a tunnel beneath Khan Yunis. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1319.92s)]
*  And there was this, I don't know, Bob, if you read this, it was this pretty extraordinary story in the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1328.0800000000002s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, citing dozens of messages that Sinwar had sent to ceasefire negotiators, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  to Hamas leaders outside of Gaza. And it sounded like he believes that Hamas is just going to [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1336.8s)]
*  benefit from more fighting, no matter the cost in civilian Palestinian lives. So if you buy into [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1342.4s)]
*  that, Hamas is not going to accept anything. On the other hand, if you buy into the notion that [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1347.2s)]
*  Hamas is dependent on international support, a move like this UN Security Council vote really [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1352.8000000000002s)]
*  matters. So we'll have to see. And then to go back to your original question, what does Bibi want? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1359.3600000000001s)]
*  And can anything satisfy him? And then that goes back to this sort of electoral math. He still has [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1365.2s)]
*  enough votes in the parliament to hold on for a while without Gantz. And he does have to make a [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1370.8s)]
*  choice here about who he himself is going to deal with. But certainly, if you look at the polls, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1376.0s)]
*  the Israeli public wants those hostages home and they want elections. And Bibi, you can debate [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1381.36s)]
*  whether or not he really wants an end to the war, because that may mean an end to his prime [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1389.2s)]
*  ministership and go into trial. But that level of isolation, including that level of isolation from [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1392.56s)]
*  the United States is what he's looking at if he refuses to move ahead with the ceasefire process. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1399.04s)]
*  . And if that was not complicated enough, Carla, there's an escalating problem with Hezbollah [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1403.6s)]
*  in the north. And one of its biggest salvos, I think since the October 7th initial attack by Hamas [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1409.36s)]
*  took place this week with more than 100 missiles fired at Israeli positions. Communities in that [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1416.1599999999999s)]
*  area have already been emptied out of tens of thousands of people. And there's a lot of concern [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1422.0s)]
*  that Israel is going to ramp up its actions against Hezbollah. The salvo this week followed [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1427.04s)]
*  the Israeli killing of a senior Hezbollah official, military official. This can continue for quite a [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1432.3999999999999s)]
*  while. Hezbollah is a lot better armed, a lot more potent than Hamas at this point. And that's a [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1437.76s)]
*  concern about a lot of regional security experts about what happens if that's the case. And by the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1442.8s)]
*  way, the Houthis continue to lob various aerial missiles and other things at shipping in the Red [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1448.32s)]
*  Sea and have continued to be potent as well. So this regional aspect continues to be a big issue [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1454.16s)]
*  here, which is again, one of the things driving the diplomatic pressure for a ceasefire. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1459.76s)]
*  . And if you look at Gantz didn't just want a plan for Gaza the day after in Gaza, he wanted [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1463.6000000000001s)]
*  a comprehensive plan for security and did not want the military occupying Gaza for the sake of [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1470.4s)]
*  Israeli security as well. And you have lots of other politicians, including interestingly enough, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1478.0s)]
*  Yair Lapid, major opposition leader, welcoming Gantz's resignation and offering Netanyahu a [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1484.08s)]
*  safety net and said he would join the coalition government to pass the ceasefire deal with the [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1490.4s)]
*  far right leave. There's lots of people saying to him, Bibi, you're really far out there on a limb. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1494.4s)]
*  Israeli security is at risk. Yes, we too wanted to destroy Hamas, but we were surrounded by enemies. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1500.64s)]
*  And this war is not resolving what the problems are. So Bibi's got some pretty big choices. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1507.44s)]
*  And the way the Americans have couched it at this point, publicly at least the pressure isn't on [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1513.8400000000001s)]
*  Bibi, but he's got some pretty big choices and except for the fact that Zemora may let him off [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1518.88s)]
*  the hook once again. So the Americans are expressing hope, but as I said, I never predict anything [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1524.0800000000002s)]
*  hopeful in this conflict. Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1531.12s)]
*  This is a figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore orgs Instagram [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1539.28s)]
*  story. And this week, Bobber audience selected the one I wanted them to select, which is four [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1544.32s)]
*  Russian military ships arrive in Cuba. Russia has been focused on its war in Ukraine. So why is it [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1550.08s)]
*  diverting its attention to travel across the world to Cuba? And is four warships a serious [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1557.2s)]
*  show of strength or are they just going through the motions? At the end of the day, Carla, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  I would say it's more of the latter going through the motions signaling, which it has done [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1568.56s)]
*  occasionally in the Caribbean to show that yes, it can operate in the US backyard just as the US [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1572.32s)]
*  operates in its backyard or it's near abroad as they like to say. Let's talk about the ships first. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1577.3600000000001s)]
*  Some initial reports were calling it a flotilla, which was a vast overstatement. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1582.56s)]
*  I don't know what a flotilla is for. And certainly the first pictures that [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1586.32s)]
*  emerged, which were taken from a celebrity cruise ship, I should add. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1589.52s)]
*  The spies of the celebrity cruise ship. This is not your grandparent's Cuban missile [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1592.6399999999999s)]
*  crisis. And I don't want to be glib about this because that was obviously one of the most serious [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1597.84s)]
*  nuclear altercations in history. It did not happen, but it played out in the fall of 1962 [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1602.24s)]
*  when there were Soviet missiles deployed in Cuba. These three ships plus a nuclear powered [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1607.68s)]
*  Russian submarine do not have nuclear weapons. And that is coming from both the US and Cuban [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1614.0s)]
*  officials. And the US has basically said they're watching this closely, but they're not concerned [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1619.1200000000001s)]
*  about this deployment of ships, which are apparently going to be in the region through the summer. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1624.08s)]
*  Russia and Cuba, it should be noted, are having a bit of a resurgence in ties that suits both [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1629.3600000000001s)]
*  countries well. The Russians, because it's nice to be able to cruise by 90 miles from the US [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1636.24s)]
*  territory and power into a Cuban port when they need to. The Cubans, because they could use the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1641.44s)]
*  various goods that Russia can provide, whether it's the 90,000 metric tons of Russian oil that [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1648.24s)]
*  Russia supplied back in March or other boosts that Cuba desperately needs in terms of infrastructure, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1652.96s)]
*  tourism, help to its sugar producing industry, which has been in a bad way recently. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1660.16s)]
*  And Russia also has continuous ties with Venezuela, which is part of this mini regional [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1666.08s)]
*  axis of resistance against the US, I guess we could say. It sort of suits their purposes to [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1671.84s)]
*  come by this area. These ships were chosen deliberately as both ships with potential, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1676.8s)]
*  but not with nuclear potential. And I think we should just sort of treat that as the gesture [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1682.16s)]
*  that it is, but it's also a sign of this worrying turn of relations between big powers and geopolitics. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1687.12s)]
*  Well, it is certainly, and we've talked about this, a very grim time inside of Cuba. They've [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1694.0s)]
*  got food shortages. They've had these massive blackouts. We're only blackouts, but for hours [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1699.52s)]
*  and hours and hours a day. And the Cubans who always like to proclaim their sovereignty [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1706.0s)]
*  are pretty desperate right now. And they can no longer depend on the Venezuelans for support. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1712.96s)]
*  So I suppose any chance to poke the US is a good one. And then he hoped that they might be getting [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1718.16s)]
*  some sort of economic and financial support for the Russians is good enough reason to float around [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1724.8000000000002s)]
*  there. And I suppose the US is not reacting particularly forcefully to it because let's [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1730.96s)]
*  face it, it's four ships. That is right. And so we again, thank our audience for choosing [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1737.2s)]
*  the number four as our figure of the week to allow Carla and I to go back into the cold war a little [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1741.52s)]
*  bit and talk about the Cuba-Russia axis. One of our greatest hits there. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1745.68s)]
*  Yes. And that's our look at the world next week. Here are some other stories to keep an eye on. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAYFlFze9L0&t=1751.8400000000001s)]
