# Israel-Iran Tensions Escalate, Venezuela Election Questioned, Edinburgh Fringe Shines, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90)
*  In the coming week, the Mideast braces for a major escalation after strikes kill Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=0.0s)]
*  and Hezbollah leaders, Venezuela struggles with a flawed presidential vote, Edinburgh's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=5.24s)]
*  Fringe Festival spotlights up-and-coming talent, and a historic prisoner swap with Russia is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=10.16s)]
*  reportedly underway. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  It's August 1st, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=16.2s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=30.92s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=31.92s)]
*  Bob, let's start with the Middle East, an enormous amount of news this week. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=33.72s)]
*  Within hours of each other, Fuad Shukur, a senior Hezbollah commander, was killed in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=38.32s)]
*  Beirut. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=42.64s)]
*  And Ismael Haniyeh, Hamas's political leader and one of its top negotiators, was killed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=44.2s)]
*  in Tehran where he had traveled for the inauguration of Iran's newly elected president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=49.660000000000004s)]
*  Israel claimed the Lebanon strike was retaliation for an attack in the Golan Heights that killed [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=55.6s)]
*  12 children and teens. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=59.68s)]
*  No one has taken responsibility for the Haniyeh killing, but there's little doubt about [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=61.84s)]
*  Israel's role. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=65.26s)]
*  Now today, Thursday, the Israeli military has announced that it killed Mohammed Daif, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=66.92s)]
*  the leader of Hamas's armed wing in Gaza and an architect of the October 7th attack. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=71.24s)]
*  He was killed in an airstrike last month that left some 90 people dead, according to Gaza [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=76.44s)]
*  health officials. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  The United States and others are calling for restraint from all sides, but are we now on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  the brink of this wider regional war that we've been fearing ever since the October [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=85.96s)]
*  7th attacks and the war in Gaza began? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=89.84s)]
*  I'm sorry to say it does seem that way, Carla. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=92.64s)]
*  Let's look to the next theater for this, which is decision making going on in Iran [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=96.88s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=101.84s)]
*  The supreme leader, somewhat unusually, attended a top level security briefing the full day [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=102.84s)]
*  after the attack and clearly indicated that there will be a response, a reprisal by Iran [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=108.24s)]
*  against Israel, seeing this as a grave violation of Iranian sovereignty, its role as a host [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=114.4s)]
*  of Ismail Haniyeh and so forth. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=120.84s)]
*  So we are looking to see in the coming days some sort of an Iranian attack. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=123.26s)]
*  Recall in April the Iranians launched their first ever direct attack against Israel, most [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=127.34s)]
*  of which was intercepted. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=132.46s)]
*  These are drones and other projectiles. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=134.02s)]
*  But we are looking to see some sort of an Iranian attack against Israel itself and we'll [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  see what nature that takes, whether or not it'll be what has been called in the past, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=141.38s)]
*  calibrated response or something different. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=146.26s)]
*  A lot of analysts that I've read and talked to are saying this just feels a bit different. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  Red lines seem to be shifting in this case. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=155.16s)]
*  Our colleague Stephen Cook has written on CFR.org that the Israeli military has opened [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=158.34s)]
*  up a new chapter in this and basically signaling to all of its enemies in the regions, particularly [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  the Axis of Resistance, that it is not going to take any of their attacks lying down. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=169.82s)]
*  It has Intel, it has capabilities to go after their top officials and that it is intent [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=176.02s)]
*  on keeping this up if it needs to protect itself. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=181.34s)]
*  So it's a calculation that seemingly both sides now are ready to go take further steps. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  So we're in a really dangerous moment and it's not clear whether any diplomatic leverage [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=190.58s)]
*  can be brought to bear on this or whether these two sides are able to, quote unquote, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=194.68s)]
*  calibrate responses that keep this from escalating. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=199.02s)]
*  I understand going after, listen, I'm not justifying any of these guys here, but in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=202.46s)]
*  the midst of the ceasefire negotiations, Haniyev was one of the negotiators and the Americans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  kept saying that they thought there were progress. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=217.06s)]
*  Certainly the Israeli military wanted these ceasefire negotiations to go ahead. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=219.06s)]
*  And also in the midst of inauguration in Iran of as close to reformists as you're going [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=223.58s)]
*  to get in Iran, it's really hard to look at that one particular assassination as anything [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=229.66s)]
*  other than an attempt to disrupt a possibility for a ceasefire negotiation and disrupt a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=236.82s)]
*  possibility for an opening potentially with Iran and the United States. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=241.66s)]
*  Am I being overly conspiratorial here? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=246.26s)]
*  Well, I think you're reflecting what had been the hopes of a lot of people who've been watching [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=248.74s)]
*  this very closely and looking for a glimmer of progress in the darkness of the last 10 [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=253.38s)]
*  months in particular. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=258.94s)]
*  But there are some who's saying, and I've been trying to keep up with all of the commentary [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=260.9s)]
*  on this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=264.74s)]
*  Some were saying that this latest incident shows, first of all, how a bit outside the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=265.74s)]
*  loop the US seems to be in this latest round in terms of the Haniyev killing, seemingly [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=269.42s)]
*  catching the US by surprise, which again, as you said, was not confirmed as an Israeli [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=274.26s)]
*  strike but is assumed to be an Israeli strike. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=278.94s)]
*  And the fact that Israel did this at this time raises all sorts of questions, including [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=281.86s)]
*  as has been noted by some, you know, just seemingly disrupts any sort of hostage return [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=287.54s)]
*  because that is a source of real domestic concern in Israel. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=292.58s)]
*  And it's a really bold step. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=295.94s)]
*  But at the same time, there are calculations going on that we are unaware of on the Israeli [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=298.2s)]
*  side and on the Iranian side repeatedly about how far they're willing to take this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=302.5s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=307.62s)]
*  It did seem like with both being on the quote unquote 10 yard line of a ceasefire deal in [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=308.62s)]
*  Gaza and a new somewhat reformist leader taking office as president in Iran, there was a [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=313.38s)]
*  little bit of ability to find traction for deescalating coming out of this crisis moment. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  But this is going to spend itself out further. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=328.42s)]
*  And it's a question of whether it then just sort of becomes this escalatory ladder into [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=330.7s)]
*  full scale war. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's the real concern, Carla. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=335.38s)]
*  So I think to answer your original question, I think there was just a lot of miscalculations [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=336.7s)]
*  along the way by people who thought they saw what was going on and saw this headed in a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=341.46s)]
*  certain direction. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  And of course, if we go back and we talked about this last week, if we go back and we [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  look again at the speech that Bibi Netanyahu gave when he came to the Congress, which was [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=349.9s)]
*  mainly about Iran. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  And there was, of course, no glimmer of a commitment to moving ahead with the ceasefire [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=358.58s)]
*  talks and that either, which there had been high hopes for that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=363.06s)]
*  But it was all about Iran. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=366.94s)]
*  And basically, don't be deceived. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=368.62s)]
*  Don't go down that road. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=370.66s)]
*  But there's something so absolutely extraordinary. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=372.14s)]
*  It's once more a reminder of what it was really intelligence is capable of. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  And the Times is reporting this morning that it wasn't a drone strike. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=378.3s)]
*  It wasn't anything from the air that apparently was a bomb that was planted in this guest [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=382.18s)]
*  house, a guest house controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, under their noses, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=387.38s)]
*  in the middle of Tehran, during an inauguration, a guest there. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=393.1s)]
*  The violation there, intelligence failure is absolutely so enormous, very hard for them [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=397.1s)]
*  now to respond to that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=400.94s)]
*  But also a calculation to saying, we've made the decision, we knew the time and place, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=402.66s)]
*  and we made the decision to do this right now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=407.98s)]
*  This is very calculated. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=409.82s)]
*  This is not an accident. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=410.82s)]
*  And then Tony Blinken, the American Secretary of State, comes out and says, we weren't informed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=412.18s)]
*  We weren't told about this, which does suggest that the Americans, as you said, are not really [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=417.94s)]
*  on top of what's going on and can't control this alliance, which goes back to the original [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=423.5s)]
*  question, is this situation spinning out of control? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  It's a pretty grim set of developments here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=430.62s)]
*  On the other hand, they're chipping away at Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=433.34000000000003s)]
*  They're certainly chipping away at the Hamas leadership, and that's what they were planning [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=436.98s)]
*  on doing. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=442.38s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=443.38s)]
*  I'll just note, we have a background on Hamas group that has had this org chart, so to speak, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=444.38s)]
*  of the Hamas leadership, and now fully half of it has been put in different colors as [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=449.3s)]
*  assassinated. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=454.18s)]
*  So Israel is moving to not only decapitate, but to try to eradicate Hamas, as they have [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=455.46000000000004s)]
*  said since the beginning. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  And so perhaps we should just start taking them at their word on that as this continues. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=462.02000000000004s)]
*  And if that happens, one would hope that they would then want to have peace and reconstruction [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=466.1s)]
*  afterwards rather than a regional war. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=471.62s)]
*  But we will have to see how much the Iranians respond, because the hope there, once again, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=473.46000000000004s)]
*  is they could have a ceasefire deal, that they would also have a calm along the border [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=478.78s)]
*  with Lebanon. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=483.17999999999995s)]
*  And this doesn't bode for that direction, but we'll have to watch and see how that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=484.17999999999995s)]
*  plays out. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=487.9s)]
*  Bob, let's move to Venezuela, where an election commission controlled by incumbent President [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=488.9s)]
*  Nicolas Maduro claimed he had won an overwhelming mandate for a third six-year term with 51.2% [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=494.91999999999996s)]
*  of the vote, while the main opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, they claim had received [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=501.73999999999995s)]
*  only 44.2%. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=507.0s)]
*  Going into the vote, opinion polls gave a huge lead to Gonzalez, and an exit poll by [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=509.58000000000004s)]
*  Edison Research, and these are the people who do exit polls here in the U.S., had Mr. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  Gonzalez leading by 65% to 31%. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=518.04s)]
*  And let's just say, I'm always skeptical about exit polls, but overwhelmingly, Maduro [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=521.0s)]
*  was not ahead in anybody's mind anywhere. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=525.24s)]
*  Turnout in opposition strongholds was notably high. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=528.12s)]
*  And then, of course, the autocrats' playbook kicked in. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=531.4s)]
*  In key polling places, election officials refused to turn over paper tallies. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=533.96s)]
*  And then there was this mysterious six-hour holdup in announcing the results in which [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=539.08s)]
*  the authorities blamed so-called terrorists. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=543.0s)]
*  I watched this happen when Pinochet tried to steal the no vote, all of that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  All of this looked incredibly, not just suspicious, this is a total sham election. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=549.76s)]
*  And many Venezuelans, many people in the international community denounced Maduro's 2018 election [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  as a sham as well. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=560.48s)]
*  And he still held onto power. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=562.14s)]
*  Was he going to tough it out again? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=563.98s)]
*  You know, that remains a question. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=566.1s)]
*  It certainly looks like he is consolidating the power sectors that he needs to, to do [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=568.34s)]
*  so. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=573.66s)]
*  But this is a different type of election, and it's worth kind of recounting exactly [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=574.66s)]
*  how we got to this moment. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=578.66s)]
*  First of all, the question about is the military behind him? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=580.02s)]
*  It would seem it is at this point. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=582.86s)]
*  The defense minister, General Vladimir Padrino, went on the air to say, quote, we reaffirm [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=584.42s)]
*  our most absolute and unconditional loyalty to Nicolas Maduro, president of the Bolivarian [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=590.44s)]
*  Republic of Venezuela, our commander in chief, who has been legitimately reelected for the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=595.72s)]
*  next presidential term. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=599.52s)]
*  So no doubt there, no doubt there. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=601.4s)]
*  So you know, 25 years of Chavista government seems to be set to continue. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=604.0s)]
*  But what got us to this moment was, first of all, the Venezuelan authorities allowing [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  this election after keeping out a winner, an overwhelming winner of the October primary [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=613.12s)]
*  of opposition candidates, Maria Corina Machado. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=618.7600000000001s)]
*  And the opposition, famously fractious in Venezuela, had been pulling together, had [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=621.6400000000001s)]
*  seen this as a moment to take a stab at a legitimate change of power, bloodless for [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  the most part, if it could pull it off. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=632.0s)]
*  And they were able to get Edmundo Gonzalez put into the fore, seen as acceptable enough [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=634.44s)]
*  not to be banned by the Maduro regime. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  He was making the right sounds about, you know, maintaining a dialogue with all sides [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=641.72s)]
*  and building up the Venezuelan institutions, projecting moderate views. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=646.36s)]
*  And as you said, by all accounts, and this was a heavily watched by the Venezuelan opposition [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=650.8399999999999s)]
*  side and by whatever independent parties could be mustered, a heavily watched vote that seemed [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=656.92s)]
*  to clearly indicate with exit polling and other signs that Gonzalez had been the victor. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=661.72s)]
*  And it was why you had this shutdown or blackout even on information for a while before the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=666.72s)]
*  government came up with its 51 percent finding of a Maduro win. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=671.88s)]
*  The Carter Center, one of the few outside observers allowed in the country, even then [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=677.08s)]
*  only to a few places, has expressed its concern about this vote. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=681.48s)]
*  All sorts of outside parties, including sympathetic leaders in the region, have all called for [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=685.72s)]
*  a proper independent review of the vote. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=690.96s)]
*  Maduro said he's asked Venezuela's Supreme Court to conduct an audit of the presidential [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=693.88s)]
*  election, but the court has seen it as in his pocket. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=697.28s)]
*  So it's not clear whether there is any sort of proper legitimate off-ramp in this. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=699.8s)]
*  And we're just going to see a consolidation of a corrupt and incompetent regime, it should [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  be noted, that has driven this country, this once very strong economy and vibrant society, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=709.88s)]
*  it should be noted, really downhill. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=715.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, upwards of I think 8 million people at this point have fled the country in recent [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=717.76s)]
*  years because of just the failures in every direction. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  If you look at any benchmarks economically, it has been a mishandled economy. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=725.18s)]
*  It has been corrupt and repressive on top of it, and kind of a thuggish repression as well. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=729.36s)]
*  But yet again, democratic enough to have this vote in which people felt like they had a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=734.32s)]
*  voice and an ability to maybe change the direction. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  And it's just not clear whether any outside voices are going to have any sway on this [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=742.96s)]
*  regime and whether or not the regime is going to really crack down heavily in terms of it's [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=747.08s)]
*  already started throwing people in jail who were seen as poll observers. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=752.12s)]
*  16 or so deaths across the country reported, maybe that's gone up since I last saw it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=756.6s)]
*  And really, again, the ability to have some sort of an off ramp that can allow this country [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=761.4s)]
*  out of its abyss seems to be shrinking. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=765.36s)]
*  So United States has tried pretty much everything as well as other countries. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=768.82s)]
*  You know, the OAS of course, which is toothless, but United States has tried all sorts of things. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=773.84s)]
*  There were sanctions and there were less sanctions, sort of starving a starving country because [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=778.16s)]
*  in the period of time there were people couldn't get food or medicine in Venezuela. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=782.0s)]
*  Once Ukraine started, they wanted to lessen up because they still, even though their refining [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=786.48s)]
*  capacity is plummeted, they still have oil. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=790.72s)]
*  Any conversation already from the United States or anybody else about how they're going to [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=794.32s)]
*  put pressure on Maduro? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=797.76s)]
*  It seemed like the initial comments from the United States seemed to be a little bit softer [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=799.2s)]
*  than I expected it to be because this to me looked like just a total ripoff. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=803.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=807.9200000000001s)]
*  And I think the initial U.S. response was to be concerned but trying to hold some wiggle [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=808.9200000000001s)]
*  room to allow some even some wiggle room for the Maduro regime to allow independent review [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=814.44s)]
*  and some sort of potential compromise approach to resolving this mess. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=819.76s)]
*  But that's not happening. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=824.0600000000001s)]
*  There was an indication in a briefing earlier this week that the U.S. was certainly open [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=825.92s)]
*  to new sanctions. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=829.74s)]
*  There have been members of Congress, particularly Republicans, who have said, you know, they [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=830.74s)]
*  need to start going into more targeted sanctions. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=834.44s)]
*  We've seen this before. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=837.24s)]
*  We've seen this play out in other countries around the world. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=838.24s)]
*  The U.S. sanctions regime is vast and sprawling and growing. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=840.84s)]
*  And the impact is really mixed. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=845.44s)]
*  But it doesn't mean you don't do them. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=847.0s)]
*  But it also doesn't mean that you should expect anything from them. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=848.76s)]
*  And all it does also to a country like Venezuela is just prolong its misery for the people [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  who are voting with their feet and fleeing. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=856.96s)]
*  And by the way, where are they fleeing to? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=858.6s)]
*  Some of them, if they can make it to the U.S. border, get in the U.S. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=861.0600000000001s)]
*  There are thousands and thousands that have come to the U.S. in recent years. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=863.52s)]
*  There are millions who have gone to neighboring countries, including Colombia. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=866.86s)]
*  Peru has taken in a lot. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=869.76s)]
*  And a lot of the countries in the region are reacting with alarm and they are being treated [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=871.28s)]
*  with derision by the Maduro regime. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=875.88s)]
*  So you have this response that's this sort of sharp autocracy. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=878.14s)]
*  It gets a few nods of approval from countries like Russia or Cuba, but otherwise, you know, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=883.7s)]
*  and Nicaragua. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=888.68s)]
*  But these are not countries that are going to bolster it too much. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=889.84s)]
*  Russia might be able to provide a little bit of support here and there. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=893.12s)]
*  It's still a country among the world's largest, if not the largest, oil reserves. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=897.2199999999999s)]
*  And yet it is so mishandled that sector that it's not something that can be any sort of [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=900.98s)]
*  a revenue line anytime soon. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=906.06s)]
*  So there's just grim outlook at this point. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=908.1999999999999s)]
*  Unless we have some sort of change of heart that takes place within this regime, it just [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=910.8199999999999s)]
*  doesn't seem likely. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=915.3s)]
*  And we're looking at more of a closing off of Venezuela than any sort of sort of constructive [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=917.04s)]
*  engagement, which I think was the last U.S. approach that they thought was going to get [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=922.0999999999999s)]
*  some traction. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=925.3000000000001s)]
*  Carla, I want to take us in a different direction. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=927.02s)]
*  I want to take us to an art festival, a massive sprawling art festival that explodes in Edinburgh, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=929.1800000000001s)]
*  Scotland every year. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=935.86s)]
*  Tomorrow, August 2nd marks the start of the three week long Fringe Festival. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=937.1s)]
*  It's a festival that features comedy, dance, theater, opera, circus, even, and even more [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=941.38s)]
*  than that. The Fringe has been the launchpad for all sorts of fresh talent. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=946.94s)]
*  We've heard these names emerge in the past. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=950.4200000000001s)]
*  Judy Dench, Alan Rickman, Robin Williams, Maggie Smith. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=953.06s)]
*  Carla, what other names are going to come out this year? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=957.38s)]
*  What should we be looking for? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=959.78s)]
*  I know you watch these things closely. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=960.8599999999999s)]
*  This isn't an easy one to make a top 10 recommendations for because it is just so vast [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=963.54s)]
*  and so wonderfully eclectic, verging on chaotic, which I gather is a big part of the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=968.8199999999999s)]
*  Fringe experience. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=974.54s)]
*  So a little history, it seems, in order first. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=976.38s)]
*  The Edinburgh Fringe Festival was founded in 1947 when eight theater companies turned up [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=978.86s)]
*  uninvited at the prestigious and highly buttoned down Edinburgh International Festival and put [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=985.66s)]
*  on their own shows pretty much anywhere they could find a space. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=990.86s)]
*  And there wasn't a lot of space left over. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=994.1800000000001s)]
*  And they've continued that tradition. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=996.98s)]
*  And like the original Fringe, anyone can participate. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=999.22s)]
*  Now they have to pay a comparatively small entrance fee. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1002.26s)]
*  And they are still using unconventional spaces from theaters to churches to pubs to [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1005.4200000000001s)]
*  university lecture halls to audience living rooms, even supposedly a double decker bus at [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1009.98s)]
*  one point and a public toilet. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1014.34s)]
*  This year's Fringe, which runs until the 26th, is scheduled to include more than 3,300 [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1016.46s)]
*  productions, theater, music, comedy, circus acts, all the things you mentioned, with 51,446 [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1021.82s)]
*  individual performances held in 262 venues. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1028.26s)]
*  Did you say 51,000, Carla? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1031.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because if you have 3,300 productions and then they, you know, it goes on for three [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1033.3799999999999s)]
*  weeks and all that. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1037.62s)]
*  And last year there were nearly two and a half million tickets issued throughout the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1039.1799999999998s)]
*  month. And when it comes to ticket events, only the Olympics and the World Cup are larger. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1042.4199999999998s)]
*  In addition to the actors you mentioned, the Fringe has given a boost to a variety of [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1047.78s)]
*  theater and television productions. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1051.54s)]
*  Most recently, the Netflix hits Baby Reindeer, something I've not watched yet. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1053.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1057.1399999999999s)]
*  And that began as a one man show at the Fringe in 2019. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1058.74s)]
*  And Phoebe Waller-Bridge performed Fleabag for the first time in 2013 at the Fringe. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1062.14s)]
*  So there's lots of things that, not surprising, those numbers, great stuff should come out [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1066.78s)]
*  of it and a lot of weird stuff as well. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1071.9s)]
*  The question that puzzles me is how a Fringe goer decides which of the more than 3,000 [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1074.0600000000002s)]
*  events to attend. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1079.02s)]
*  There, of course, we've got an app for that. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1080.3400000000001s)]
*  There is an online program and you can sort it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1082.8200000000002s)]
*  And I've been playing with it for the last few days. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1085.98s)]
*  You can sort it by show or performer or category or venue or date. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1087.78s)]
*  And there's this official Fringe app, which also has this shake to search function. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1091.26s)]
*  And apparently if you shake your phone, it suggests random shows as well. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1096.6999999999998s)]
*  So if you just want to just want to go random for the Fringe, you can do this as well. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1100.6999999999998s)]
*  I am, as you know, a very organized person, so I tend to rely on the critics to curate [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1106.26s)]
*  my experiences and our researcher, Halilakopin Johnson, gathered several what to see on [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1110.74s)]
*  the Fringe list to whet her appetites. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1116.74s)]
*  And what she found is not only where there are not a lot of big headliners, there was [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1118.42s)]
*  very little overlap between the lists, which tells you once again a lot about the eye of [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1122.1000000000001s)]
*  the beholder Fringe experiences. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1126.98s)]
*  So I went through these lists that she came up with, and I also played with the Fringe [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1129.22s)]
*  online. I like musicals. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1133.0600000000002s)]
*  I like music. So I went for the musicals, most of them. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1135.14s)]
*  One of the things I'm not sure this is a musical, Weather Girl by the producers of Fleabag [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1138.74s)]
*  and Baby Reindeer. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1142.5s)]
*  And this is how they describe it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1143.7s)]
*  Smile while it burns. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1145.5s)]
*  Stacey is a California weather girl, an over-sexed and underpaid harbinger of our dying [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1146.9s)]
*  planet. But today, her regular routine of wildfires, prosecco and teeth whitening [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1151.42s)]
*  descends into a scorched earth catastrophe before she discovers something that will save [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1155.86s)]
*  us all. A dazzling rampage into the soul of American strangeness. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1159.98s)]
*  So that's Weather Girl. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1164.34s)]
*  There are two, count them, two musicals based on the Gwyneth Paltrow ski crash trial. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1166.5s)]
*  Gwyneth Goes Skiing and Gwyneth Goes Skiing, I Wish You Well. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1171.26s)]
*  There's Beowulf the musical. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1174.54s)]
*  There's the Bloody Ballad of Bette Davis under musicals and operas, horror musical [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1177.26s)]
*  theater. What if Bette Davis were a witch? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1182.1s)]
*  Then there's the Emu War, a new musical. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1186.54s)]
*  In 1932, thousands of World War I veterans went to war with Australia's Emu population [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1189.6599999999999s)]
*  to turn the outback into an agrarian paradise. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1194.82s)]
*  Inspired by true events, this new comedy musical showcases the futility of human hubris [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1197.58s)]
*  against thousands of six foot tall birds. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1202.46s)]
*  So Bette Davis, a witch, and Emu is left there. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1205.38s)]
*  And then, of course, two separate Gwyneth Paltrow ski. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1208.8600000000001s)]
*  Ah, the horror of the humanity of Gwyneth Paltrow. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1212.06s)]
*  I don't know where to begin, Carla. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1215.78s)]
*  Although I do want to see the Beowulf the musical. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1217.18s)]
*  So I'm going to mark that down. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1219.42s)]
*  We will put on our show notes page the link that you mentioned, which is for, I guess, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1221.3400000000001s)]
*  the app you download to try to get started somewhere. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1225.06s)]
*  Yeah, there's an app and there's also just an online tool that you can use to get [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1227.42s)]
*  to the end of the show. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1231.26s)]
*  And there's also just an online tool that you can search by children and musical and [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1232.1s)]
*  whatever it is you want to look for. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1236.34s)]
*  I just had an enormous amount of fun looking at these descriptions. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1237.78s)]
*  That's great. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1240.9s)]
*  I mean, anybody who's been to an arts festival of this nature, I've been to smaller ones [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1241.34s)]
*  in the Czech Republic and in the States for that matter. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1244.66s)]
*  And there's a lot of fun. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1247.3s)]
*  And it's just the discovery aspect in some cases and the stumbling upon things. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1248.22s)]
*  That's great, too. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1252.34s)]
*  But yeah, it would be advised to sort of check out what's the lineup before you go, given [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1253.7s)]
*  the vastness of this one. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1257.7s)]
*  Or you can just shake. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1258.86s)]
*  Yourself or your phone? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1260.26s)]
*  Let the gods tell you where to go. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1261.78s)]
*  Carla, I want to take us to another topic that we've discussed repeatedly on this [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1264.34s)]
*  podcast, which is Russia's detention of American journalists and other nationals, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1268.38s)]
*  because there's some breaking news that we teased at the top of this podcast. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1273.98s)]
*  It includes detained journalist Evan Gershkovich and Alsuk Khromosheva. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1277.54s)]
*  But I wanted to toss it to you to give us a sense of where this stands at this point. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1281.58s)]
*  Well, Bob, the news is still coming through. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1285.46s)]
*  But as we were taping the podcast on Thursday, this is a very complex [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1287.6599999999999s)]
*  multi-country prisoner swap with the Russians involving 24 people. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1292.54s)]
*  That is Fried, our colleague, Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, as you [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1297.2199999999998s)]
*  said, also Alsuk Khromosheva from RFE RL, who we've spoken about quite a lot. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1300.58s)]
*  So we're thrilled about this. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1306.9399999999998s)]
*  Also reportedly Fried Hall Whalen, a former U.S. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1309.1799999999998s)]
*  Marine who was arrested in 2018. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1311.54s)]
*  Russian dissident Ilya Yashin, Vladimir Karamurza, a Pulitzer Prize winning [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1314.34s)]
*  Washington Post opinions contributor who is out as well. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1318.78s)]
*  This is all really good news. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1323.18s)]
*  Oleg Orlov, the co-chairman of Memorial, which is a Russian human rights group. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1324.8999999999999s)]
*  And German national Rico Krieger, who had been sentenced to death for [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1330.18s)]
*  quote terrorism in Belarus, very obviously protector of Russia. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1334.86s)]
*  What did the Russians get in exchange? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1341.8999999999999s)]
*  We haven't gotten the full list yet, but supposedly they've gotten eight [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1343.46s)]
*  people in exchange for these 16. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1346.5s)]
*  Germany released Vadim Krasikov, who was a Russian convicted of murdering a [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1348.58s)]
*  Chechen, former separatist fighter in Berlin. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1352.8999999999999s)]
*  Putin had made very clear this is someone he wanted back. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1355.74s)]
*  And the United States released a hacker, Vladislav Kiryushin, and two others [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1358.98s)]
*  whose name we do not yet have. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1363.98s)]
*  And supposedly Slovenia, Poland, and Norway have also released [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1366.3s)]
*  several accused Russian spies. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1372.3s)]
*  So we know that in total there are 22 journalists jailed in [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1375.1000000000001s)]
*  Russia in addition to Evan. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1379.22s)]
*  So not everyone is out. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1381.38s)]
*  We have to remember lots of other people who are in jail, but right now [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1383.26s)]
*  this is very good news. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1387.22s)]
*  Evan and Alsou are out, Vladimir is out, and there's lots of other people who [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1389.1000000000001s)]
*  still have to be freed, but extraordinarily good news for a change. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1394.42s)]
*  So it's being called the biggest prisoner swap of this nature since the Cold War. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1398.26s)]
*  The previous biggest one was in 2010, where people like Anna Chapman were [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1402.1000000000001s)]
*  among those released to the Russian Anna Chapman, but this is a bigger in scale. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1406.66s)]
*  And in our previous discussions, Karla, we had talked about the complicated [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1411.1000000000001s)]
*  nature of pulling off something like this because of not just, it's not just [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1414.42s)]
*  a straight US Russia, and it looks like seven or so countries involved, really [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1418.6200000000001s)]
*  extraordinarily complex and the kind of anatomy of the deal I'm sure will be [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1422.74s)]
*  coming out in days to come. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1427.1s)]
*  But I find that fascinating. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1428.22s)]
*  The question of whether or not this kind of thing is going to continue in terms of [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1430.14s)]
*  seizing people in Russia in particular remains to be seen. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1433.1s)]
*  But as you say, the first human reaction is to be really relieved at these [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1436.58s)]
*  releases and all these names that we've talked about and been concerned about [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1441.06s)]
*  for so long. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1444.34s)]
*  And you have to sort of wonder why Putin was willing to do this. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1445.82s)]
*  I mean, the relations are so incredibly bad now between Putin and the West, and [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1449.8999999999999s)]
*  particularly between Putin and the Biden administration. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1455.06s)]
*  Former President Trump has been going around saying that Putin was going to do [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1457.8999999999999s)]
*  him the favor and it was going to do it for him and he was going to give nothing [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1461.26s)]
*  to get Evan Gershkovitz back. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1465.1s)]
*  But this is analysis for another day. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1467.06s)]
*  Right now, let's just celebrate the freeing of our colleagues, of extraordinary [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1469.9399999999998s)]
*  people who were taken hostage for doing their jobs. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1474.1399999999999s)]
*  And yes, the price was paid and there will be critics who say that some of the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1477.1s)]
*  people who were freed in exchange shouldn't have been freed. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1481.9s)]
*  But that's the nature of these sort of swaps. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1484.46s)]
*  And Evan is free and also is free and Kara Merz is free. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1486.62s)]
*  And these are all people who are extraordinary people. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1490.58s)]
*  And thank God they're free. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1492.54s)]
*  And those three in particular, there was a great deal of dedicated, continued [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1493.54s)]
*  campaigning on their behalf, which is worth noting. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1498.3799999999999s)]
*  Wall Street Journal is extraordinary. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1500.9s)]
*  We have Evan RFERL for Alsou to name a couple. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1502.62s)]
*  Alsou's family had just passed through the United States and appeared on several [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1505.86s)]
*  media talking about her case as well. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1508.86s)]
*  So this kind of thing is important. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1510.9399999999998s)]
*  Who knows how it filters back to the Kremlin, but it is important. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1513.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1515.78s)]
*  So a little bit of good news today. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1516.3799999999999s)]
*  All right, Carla, we talked ourselves into the audience figure of the week part [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1518.82s)]
*  of the podcast and that ding that you wait for with great expectation every week. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1522.06s)]
*  Carla. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1526.3799999999999s)]
*  My favorite thing. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1527.34s)]
*  This is the figure that listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1530.2199999999998s)]
*  underscore orgs Instagram story. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1534.3799999999999s)]
*  This week, an intriguing selection, Wagner commander killed in Mali. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1536.86s)]
*  Carla, can you tell us what we should know about this case? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1541.8999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I probably going to tell you more about what we don't know about [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1545.94s)]
*  this, but it is a reminder of what the Russians have taken on in Mali and other [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1550.3799999999999s)]
*  countries in Africa, and especially at a time when they're pretty overstretched in [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1554.3799999999999s)]
*  Ukraine late last week, an unknown number of Wagner fighters and Wagner [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1558.86s)]
*  we talked about this so much before, but per Goshen's, you know, mercenaries. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1564.06s)]
*  They are now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian defense ministry. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1567.6599999999999s)]
*  Anyway, these Wagner fighters and a detachment of Malian military forces were [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1571.94s)]
*  attacked in the desert near the border with Algeria and the attack has been [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1576.3s)]
*  claimed by both the permanent strategic framework for peace, security and [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1581.22s)]
*  development, which is a twaric separatist group and an Al Qaeda affiliate J N I M. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1584.74s)]
*  And the casualty numbers are also really murky. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1591.58s)]
*  Reportedly, some 50 to 80 Russians were killed and around 15 captured. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1595.62s)]
*  We've no idea the number of Malian soldiers were killed or captured. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1600.46s)]
*  This Wagner 13th brigade commander, Sergei Shevchenko was among those [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1604.22s)]
*  reportedly killed and there's also reports that a incredibly well-known [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1609.54s)]
*  Russian military blogger Nikita Fedyanin from the gray zone was also supposedly [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1614.74s)]
*  killed in this attack. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1620.38s)]
*  The J N I M has been increasing activities in Northern Mali for quite a while in [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1622.6200000000001s)]
*  other parts of Africa with five attacks just in the last week. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1627.42s)]
*  They also attacked in Mali and Niger Burkina Faso and in Togo. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1630.7s)]
*  And in January, the Russian deputy defense minister announced that the, what [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1635.7s)]
*  they're now calling the Africa core, not the Wagner group, but that's the Wagner [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1639.5800000000002s)]
*  forces plan to increase its strength in Mali from a hundred to 300 personnel, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1643.8600000000001s)]
*  which is, you know, the slippery slope there. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1648.9s)]
*  So they're getting deeper involved and they're obviously not finding a [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1651.54s)]
*  particularly easy time of it in Mali. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1656.22s)]
*  The question is why they're doing it. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1658.14s)]
*  You know, why are they so deeply getting more deeply involved in Mali? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1659.66s)]
*  The Kremlin has used Wagner as a proxy force to challenge the West, to [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1663.18s)]
*  challenge the French who were kicked out when the military took over in [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1667.66s)]
*  Mali in exchange for Wagner. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1671.1000000000001s)]
*  There've been reports as well that these countries have been used as [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1673.8200000000002s)]
*  transshipment for military arms to Ukraine and a variety of other reasons. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1677.5800000000002s)]
*  But given how overstretched they are in Ukraine, if they keep losing forces, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1682.1000000000001s)]
*  certainly at that large number, I'm wondering if they're going to start [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1685.8600000000001s)]
*  questioning the wisdom of this Africa core of deployment. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1689.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1693.22s)]
*  I think that's for me, a huge question. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1693.46s)]
*  This seems to be even a partial number of the people killed as comes to light. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1695.5s)]
*  That's a big setback for any country. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1700.66s)]
*  And especially your country that has big aspirations, you know, in this part of [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1703.26s)]
*  Africa, where we have talked about the decline of democracy and the growing [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1707.5s)]
*  incidents of coups and the fact that after coups, these countries tend to be [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1712.82s)]
*  receptive to messaging from Russia and China, which is less about, you know, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1716.58s)]
*  holding their feet to the fire on democratic norms and rule of law, but more [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1721.26s)]
*  like, you know, being a bit transactional. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1724.8999999999999s)]
*  So it'll be very interesting to see how much Russia decides this is worth it or [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1726.8999999999999s)]
*  not to be involved in their Africa core. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1732.5s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJrl4tc6s90&t=1735.54s)]
