# TWNW Special Surveying Foreign Media Coverage of U.S. Election 2024
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY)
*  Welcome to the World Next Week's special U.S. election 2024 episode. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=4.48s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=5.28s)]
*  Next week, EEC, Tuesday, November 5th, the United States will choose a new president [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=7.2s)]
*  and the world is certainly watching. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=12.4s)]
*  Today, our episode is dedicated to laying out how newsrooms from around the globe have been [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=15.36s)]
*  covering the election and how that reflects on public interest. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=19.2s)]
*  It's October 31st, 2024, Halloween, and time for the World Next Week. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=22.88s)]
*  Bob, the election is dominating every U.S. news outlet from the constant horse race [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=30.0s)]
*  predictions, and I vow I'm not going to read those stories, but they are an addiction, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  to the more substantive analyses of how a Harris or Trump presidency will shape the U.S. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=49.84s)]
*  and the world for the next four years. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  This is a hugely high-stake election for the country and hugely high-stake for the world, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  but this is also a year of elections around the world and also a year of enormous global [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=61.2s)]
*  turmoil from Ukraine to Gaza to Sudan to the South China Sea. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=65.44s)]
*  So given all that's going on out there, how much has the foreign press been paying attention to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=70.08s)]
*  our own upcoming vote? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, what we've done is we've done a survey, not scientific, but pretty comprehensive nonetheless, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=75.92s)]
*  and certainly by all appearances, you and I are kind of news junkies anyway, Carla, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=81.76s)]
*  global news junkies, but I think it's safe to assume that this is a widespread phenomenon. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  It's because in this year of elections, the biggest enchilada of them all is the U.S. election. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=94.48s)]
*  This is the big standard bearer for all the flaws and hypocrisy and things that we've noted on this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=99.12s)]
*  podcast and elsewhere. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=105.04s)]
*  The United States matters, and how it votes matters to the rest of the world. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=106.4s)]
*  As we'll discuss in this podcast, I think, Carla, in certain places there's a higher intensity [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=111.76s)]
*  interest than others, but it's getting a great deal of interest. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  I'll just mention anecdotally, obviously, Europe, huge front and center interest. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  This is the transatlantic alliance that Trump has steered in a different direction, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  certainly rhetorically in his first term, and he talks transactionally, as has been pointed out [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  repeatedly about U.S. relationships with its allies, asking them to, in the case of NATO, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  pony up more money for dues and things like that when he's really talking about his defense [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=139.84s)]
*  spending so they can do their share. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=145.04s)]
*  It's gotten a huge amount of interest because Europeans are at once trying to, quote unquote, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=147.28s)]
*  Trump-proof their policies, but also I think it's just in the case of Europe, it's really caused some [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  naval gazing on their own about how they are in a situation where their futures seem to be pegged [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=157.6s)]
*  to another country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=164.32s)]
*  There's a quote that's been going around a little bit that I think sums up both the incredible [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=165.52s)]
*  level of interest and sophistication in Europe and elsewhere about the U.S. elections as well [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  as the dilemma. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=174.4s)]
*  There was a French Europe minister, Benjamin Haddad, who was quoted on television last week, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=175.52s)]
*  this is via Political Europe, as saying, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  Let's get out of collective denial. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=182.88s)]
*  Europeans must take their own destiny into their hands regardless of who's elected U.S. president. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=184.56s)]
*  We cannot leave the security of Europe in the hands of voters in Wisconsin every four years. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  A note of the swing state role. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=193.44s)]
*  Interesting choice of that swing state, yes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=194.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=196.24s)]
*  Love French, love cheese. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=196.56s)]
*  Exactly. I'll just add really quickly, the interest does range from what could be said, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=198.0s)]
*  somewhat ambivalence across Africa, where many are seeing not a huge amount of difference in either [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=203.92s)]
*  candidate in terms of the bottom line for Africa. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=210.96s)]
*  Again, that's a sweeping generalization to Asia where there's a particular concern about what is [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  the impact on economic matters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=218.08s)]
*  And Trump has talked quite a bit and unabashedly about tariffs and beautiful tariffs and raising [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=221.12s)]
*  them, not just on China. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  And Latin America, where you would imagine unsurprisingly, you'll see interest in U.S. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=227.84s)]
*  immigration policy, given the huge numbers of people in the Western Hemisphere have come [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=232.72000000000003s)]
*  through the U.S., certainly during the Biden administration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=237.44s)]
*  And we try to get a count of how many foreign correspondents who have come to the United States. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=240.24s)]
*  We haven't gotten an answer on that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=246.88s)]
*  But no, I mean, there's generally speaking, I've seen the estimate of 10 to 15,000 accredited [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=248.72s)]
*  foreign journalists in the United States in general. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=253.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean just for the elections, but it stands to reason they're going to be covering [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=256.0s)]
*  the country. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=259.68s)]
*  If you look at some of the bigger newspapers around the world, again, especially in Europe, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=260.64s)]
*  and you go to their main homepage of the websites, there are dedicated sections to the U.S. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=266.0s)]
*  elections that are prominent on those pages. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=269.44s)]
*  You know, El País, Neues Urkutzeitung, Germany's Süddeutsche Zeitung, and so forth. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=271.44s)]
*  So it is an important story. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=276.88s)]
*  And like in the U.S., covering U.S. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  elections seems to sell papers or sell ads. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=280.64s)]
*  There's interest in it, and advertisers want to advertise on those high-volume coverage. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=283.68s)]
*  And so it's a perpetuating cycle, seemingly. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=288.24s)]
*  We talk to journalists all the time. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  We tend to hang out with our colleagues, and there's anxiety. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=297.44s)]
*  And this fear that the United States is going to turn inward, and more in some regions than [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=298.64s)]
*  in other regions. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=303.92s)]
*  And they seem to be asking the same questions we are asking, and high anxiety and recently [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=304.88s)]
*  high sophistication in the conversations that we're having. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=310.4s)]
*  Yes, very much so. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=312.8s)]
*  And I'll note on that we're going to mention some other coverage that caught our attention, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=314.0s)]
*  but just this week in the Columbia Journalism Review, they interviewed seven correspondents [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=317.36s)]
*  from other countries covering the U.S. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=321.68s)]
*  elections from places from Poland to China and Singapore and so forth. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=323.04s)]
*  Really interesting to see their perspectives, what they're looking at, and how this all [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=326.88s)]
*  adds up to them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=330.16s)]
*  And as you note, the sophistication is in some ways a little bit humbling in terms of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=330.8s)]
*  the depth of their understanding of the U.S. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=334.88s)]
*  But Carla, you know, it's only natural for the press to jump on stories that involve [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  big names like Elon Musk or celebrities like Taylor Swift and Beyonce, who have been named [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=341.2s)]
*  in these campaigning stories going on. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  An enormous amount of coverage of Elon Musk everywhere, every region. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=348.88s)]
*  Musk's involvement with Trump is just really drawing an enormous amount of attention. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=352.72s)]
*  And clearly this interest has been tremendous. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=356.8s)]
*  Coverage of campaign events has been consistent. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=358.88s)]
*  But can you talk a little bit about what foreign coverage has really grabbed your attention? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=361.04s)]
*  So if I could do needle point, which I stipulate I cannot do, I would make a pillow that says [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=365.6s)]
*  media is a plural noun. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=370.8s)]
*  And coverage, of course, varies from country to country and from outlet to outlet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=373.04s)]
*  And it depends on the interests of the editors, the owners, the reporters, and of course, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  the readers, viewers and listeners, and in some cases, the censors, because some of these [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  news outlets are controlled by their governments. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=384.8s)]
*  So with that caveat and the caveat you've already given, which is this is completely [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=388.08s)]
*  anecdotal and skewing English language or the language that we ourselves speak, I've [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=391.76s)]
*  been really having an incredibly fun time doing this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  There's certainly the self-interested coverage, you know. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  What does this mean for us? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=402.72s)]
*  You know, stories like the New Zealand Herald. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=404.32s)]
*  Inside economics, Trump or Harris? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=406.64s)]
*  What will the fallout for New Zealand look like? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=408.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=411.52s)]
*  Who is better for Asia? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=413.04s)]
*  And the Singapore Straits Times. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=414.0s)]
*  I'm going to spoil that for you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=416.16s)]
*  I was surprised because it's a conservative paper. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=417.6s)]
*  The answer was Kamala in that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=419.44s)]
*  Because of tariffs, of course, and because they're feared that they're going to be [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=421.52s)]
*  forced to take sides in ASEAN on the China versus the US. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=425.04s)]
*  Not surprisingly, given their survival is on the line, Ukraine's English language, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=429.52s)]
*  Keefe Post, has done one of the most granular dives on the elections impact that I've seen [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=433.92s)]
*  with a story that looks at, quote, the five best and worst House Republicans for Ukraine [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=439.04s)]
*  including their chances for re-election. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=444.16s)]
*  And that's a pretty extraordinarily deep dive for a story in a Ukrainian paper, but [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=447.2s)]
*  really matters to them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=452.4s)]
*  I've really been impressed, and you were talking about these sections that papers have by the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=453.92s)]
*  space and time that has been devoted to explaining the mechanics and the key issues in our elections. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=458.24s)]
*  The Irish Times, which according to the Reuters Institute at Oxford, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=463.44s)]
*  has the highest trust level in Ireland. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=467.36s)]
*  And 18% of readers report logging in at least once a week, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=470.08s)]
*  which is probably four or five down in this, but it's still a pretty big site. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=473.6s)]
*  They have a US election explain section which includes stories on how does the electoral [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=479.36s)]
*  college work, how do congressional races work, and stories on the potential impact of debates [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  over abortion, immigration, the economy. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=489.12s)]
*  It's pretty in-depth stuff. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=491.6s)]
*  Frances Lamond, which is the second highest reach online in the country and the second highest trust [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  rating, also has a section on the US 2024 elections including an explainer on, you got it, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=497.84s)]
*  the electoral college. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=503.52s)]
*  Clearly, we're not the only ones who are confused about this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=505.2s)]
*  And they also have this really intriguing story on how elections work more generally. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=508.23999999999995s)]
*  A very idiosyncratic approach to vote counting, an explanation on how states are called. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=512.56s)]
*  Does the AP call it? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=518.8s)]
*  What are exit polls? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=520.16s)]
*  I think that's just really intriguing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=521.52s)]
*  It's incredible public service journalism. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=522.9599999999999s)]
*  It's the sort of things we try to explain to our readers and they are explaining it to French [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=525.2800000000001s)]
*  readers. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  I find that really fascinating. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=530.0s)]
*  They even have an interactive swing state simulator in which you can put Arizona in the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=531.76s)]
*  Harris or in the Trump column and see what happens so you can play the game. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=536.48s)]
*  I kept thinking, is this an American paper? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  That was pretty cool. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=541.5200000000001s)]
*  As for in-depth coverage that really drew my attention, the Singapore Straits Times, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  which I've already mentioned, this is the most read paper offline and the third most visited [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=547.84s)]
*  news site in Singapore according to the Reuters Institute. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=552.32s)]
*  Their US bureau chief, Bhagyashree Garakar, and I'm dying to meet her, she also covered the US [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=555.84s)]
*  during the Bush Obama administrations and she has done this incredibly intensive coverage of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=562.08s)]
*  this campaign throughout this year. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=566.4000000000001s)]
*  Recent stories include a look at this Washington Post and LA Times non-endorsement controversies, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=568.6400000000001s)]
*  Americans' mistrust of the electoral process, a takeout on what drives America's young voters. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  That story is the last one so far in what has been a 10-part series slugged, American Evolution 2024. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=580.4s)]
*  She's gone to Springfield, Ohio, Dearborn, Michigan, Salem, New Hampshire, Nashville, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=588.8s)]
*  Tennessee, Stewart, Florida, Charlottesville, Virginia, lots of other places. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=593.36s)]
*  She's looked at issues like book banning, the culture wars, the debate over the future democracy, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=598.16s)]
*  white rage, immigration, celebrity culture, the role of independent voters, the role of Arab voters, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=602.16s)]
*  the role of Latino voters. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=606.8s)]
*  This is incredibly ambitious and costly work for a non-US paper. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=608.48s)]
*  And her editors, now she used to be the foreign editor so she obviously has a lot of swag with [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=612.48s)]
*  her editors, they've obviously decided it's important and their readers either will or [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=617.12s)]
*  should care and I'm really impressed. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  So can I do one more thing here? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=624.48s)]
*  CB. Sure, go for it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=625.84s)]
*  JG. I have an award for the snarkiest or at least the sniffiest coverage, which goes to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=626.64s)]
*  Politico Europe, which has sent the editor of their London Playbook PM newsletter, Emilio [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=631.6s)]
*  Casalicchio, to cover the last gas of the election here and among his stories, a look at [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=636.88s)]
*  the quote, gun-toting British Americans in Georgia who plan to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=642.48s)]
*  And I have to read the lead of this, okay? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=647.84s)]
*  And the dateline is Dallonega, Georgia. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=649.84s)]
*  Fiona Bagley was born in Epsom, a historic spa town in a leafy corner of England. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=653.68s)]
*  She owns an English goods store, a quaint tea room, two deadly crossbows and an AK-47 assault [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=658.96s)]
*  rifle. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=664.72s)]
*  On November 5th, she will vote for Donald Trump. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=665.52s)]
*  I'm not sure that's really a trend, but sniffy. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  JG. Very sniffy, but also again, the extent of the coverage that we're seeing is really [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=672.08s)]
*  astonishing. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=676.88s)]
*  As you were talking, I was getting an idea probably too late to act on in any reasonable [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=677.36s)]
*  way, but it would be really neat. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=681.6s)]
*  CB. What, flying a crossbow? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=682.64s)]
*  JG. No, more of a informational service. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=683.36s)]
*  It would be really neat to have some sort of aggregator site that cherry picks the best [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=686.24s)]
*  coverage of the elections from the rest of the world. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=690.32s)]
*  I think it would be a service to Americans as well as the rest of the world, but maybe [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  that's a service we're providing, Carla, who knows? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=695.7600000000001s)]
*  I would also say, let's not forget podcasts. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=697.84s)]
*  I'm still discovering podcasts outside the US that I can listen to and understand. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=700.96s)]
*  And I already mentioned I'm a fan of the rest is politics where you have two former UK [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  insiders, one former Tory MP, the other who used to work for Tony Blair, riffing on the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=710.0s)]
*  US elections in a very sophisticated way. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  They both went to the conventions and had lots of interesting insights. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=716.48s)]
*  And they've also had a spinoff called the rest is politics US that is Katie Kay, BBC, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=720.24s)]
*  and Anthony Scaramucci, you might recall from the former Trump, brief Trump. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=725.92s)]
*  Very brief. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=730.56s)]
*  I believe it's the most listened to podcast in Europe, the main rest is politics podcast. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=732.48s)]
*  They spend an enormous amount of time in the US elections, why they matter. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=736.24s)]
*  And they really try to relate it to British politics and other democratic politics as [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=739.68s)]
*  much as possible. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=743.36s)]
*  Australian Broadcasting Corporation does a nice job. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=744.56s)]
*  They had a recent podcast where they first of all noted there's 100,000 Americans who [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=747.44s)]
*  live in Australia who are going to vote absentee. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=752.32s)]
*  That's a lot bigger figure than I would have imagined. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  And they went out of the way to find two representatives of voters, one who's going [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=756.96s)]
*  to vote for Harris or already has and one who has voted for Trump and why that is. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  And it was a very interesting discussion they had with both who are sitting as far away [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=765.2s)]
*  as you can from the United States while voting and having really clear passions about how [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=770.48s)]
*  the election is going to turn out and what they think about the candidates and so forth. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=774.96s)]
*  And then I'm sure there are many other podcasts that are doing some of the same, but it is an [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=779.12s)]
*  indication again of just the intensity of interest and how this driving places to really invest in [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  and show the level of interest in the United States still to this day at a time when people [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=791.6s)]
*  think that kind of interest is waning. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=796.48s)]
*  I'd also like to just call out for listeners interested in foreign policy that CFR itself [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=798.4000000000001s)]
*  has a web hub, CFR.org's special election 2024 hub where we track both major candidates positions [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=803.92s)]
*  on 10 crucial foreign policy issues from Ukraine, Middle East policy, trade, climate change and so [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=810.9599999999999s)]
*  forth. Please go to CFR.org for that. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=817.52s)]
*  Finally, I think this also raised quite an interesting phenomenon, which is how many [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=820.4s)]
*  people who are expats who are living in the United States and that these new sites are also writing [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=824.88s)]
*  for and providing public service journalism. La Nación en Buenos Aires, which is a pretty [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=830.4s)]
*  conservative newspaper, has run, these aren't stories, they're basically just public service [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=835.68s)]
*  announcements in the paper, where to vote in Miami, Florida in the 2024 election for Argentine [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=841.92s)]
*  Americans reading La Nación online or if you made a mistake when voting in California, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=848.48s)]
*  here's what you can do to rectify it. I didn't know that you could even do that. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=853.84s)]
*  My particular favorite, US elections 2024, can you vote with a gun license in Texas? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=858.56s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  Can you bet the answer to that? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=865.12s)]
*  I would bet yes. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  You've clearly been reading La Nación. Bob, it sounds like the last election seems so long ago, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=870.7199999999999s)]
*  but maybe it's the PTSD from this election. Can you compare this year's foreign coverage to [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=878.88s)]
*  previous years anxiety levels, quality? Certainly this isn't the first US election to hold global [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=884.96s)]
*  attention. Yeah, and it's worth saying first, there is some phrase that comes up a lot, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=890.0s)]
*  which is the most consequential election in our lifetime and young people tend to say it, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=895.36s)]
*  maybe many times young people who are voting for the first time and it does feel that way for them [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=899.2s)]
*  and that's understandable, but I have certainly seen other elections like that. This one, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=903.28s)]
*  given the length and the intensity, and let's not forget, it's the divisiveness that's been stirred [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=908.56s)]
*  up. You've had two clear-cut attempts at assassinating candidate Trump, among other [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=914.0s)]
*  things, and some really nasty language that's been appearing in ways that just feel very different [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=919.04s)]
*  and we've had our share of political campaigns that have been nasty, certainly, but this one's [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=924.56s)]
*  just different. I would say that overall, this one, it's partly a feel thing. Having covered and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=928.96s)]
*  viewed election cycles, it just feels like this is a bigger amount of attention. It has to do [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=935.52s)]
*  with the way the media covers things, the ability of international media to do this kind of coverage [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=941.28s)]
*  that you mentioned, I think, Carla. Some of it can be done from the home countries using digital [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=946.4s)]
*  media, while certainly some are investing in people coming into the United States and going [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=951.28s)]
*  to swing states and interviewing people in cafes and so forth. I do think there feels like there's [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=955.28s)]
*  a greater deal of interest, partly because of something you mentioned at the outset, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=961.04s)]
*  which is the sense of democracy in decline, or at least on the run in some places where democracy [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=964.56s)]
*  really matters and people might have taken it for granted. And so media tend to be free media [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=970.08s)]
*  where there is democracy. These media will step up and they will play a role in its self-interest, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=974.72s)]
*  its broader interest, its public interest. And I think they're really seizing on something that [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=980.0s)]
*  they feel is under threat this year. This council has been doing a lot of more writing recently, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=985.0400000000001s)]
*  and our colleague Jim Lindsay has been doing a lot on the so-called axis of autocracies, Russia, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=989.84s)]
*  China, North Korea, and Iran becoming more of a potentially a threat, more of an in-sync threat. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  That has aroused concern. These countries, many of them are also involved in misinformation [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  campaigns, Russia, a particular really extensive campaign to try to drum up divisiveness in the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1005.6s)]
*  United States and seeming to succeed in some respects. And there's just a great deal of [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  unknowns about what a second Trump administration will mean for the world. He is a wild card. It is [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1016.08s)]
*  clearly, it's not showing favoritism one way or another. It's just he is a different animal as it [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1020.64s)]
*  pertains to foreign policy. Some of his backers certainly like that. Others dismiss that and try [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1025.68s)]
*  to normalize some of what he's saying. And it clearly arouses interest. And you mentioned [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1030.96s)]
*  Elon Musk. That's a new variable. That has never been the case before. And this is Elon Musk who [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1036.72s)]
*  owns still one of the largest social media platforms, at least one of the more intense [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1041.2s)]
*  places for exchanging views and information, which is X or formerly Twitter. So I think that adds to [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1045.2s)]
*  this being a different type of campaign than previous ones. And again, my first foray of living [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1050.96s)]
*  abroad happened in the year that George H.W. Bush ran against Bill Clinton. And I was starting [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1056.88s)]
*  freshly for Radio Free Europe at the time in Munich. And at the time it was seen as an upset. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1063.68s)]
*  Everybody thought George H.W. Bush, he's an incumbent. He's powerful. He's from this generation [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1069.68s)]
*  that won the Cold War. And Bill Clinton comes in and defeats him. And people at the radios were [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1073.76s)]
*  astounded. People from the other countries and Eastern Bloc, but they were also full of admiration [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1078.72s)]
*  that the U.S. was peacefully handing over power in this fashion. And it was something that they [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1083.92s)]
*  wished for their own countries to emulate. And some of the countries that these people, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1089.1200000000001s)]
*  my colleagues in those days represented, have emulated that. Others have not. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1092.24s)]
*  I recall a conversation I had with a fellow broadcaster who's from the Russian service, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1096.24s)]
*  who was very proud of his Russian culture and his background, but also a huge admirer of the United [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1100.8s)]
*  States. And I remember saying to him, you know, it's sometimes an intense thing to be in the United [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1105.84s)]
*  States because it just feels like it's the center of the world and there's no regard for the rest of [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1109.84s)]
*  the world. And he said, well, Bob, you know, it is the center of the world. I certainly consider it [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1113.76s)]
*  that. And I think a lot of people are envious of the United States. And so there's a little of that. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1118.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to take it too far, Carla, but I do think that U.S. presidential elections have been [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1123.1999999999998s)]
*  increasingly followed. They've been followed with the globalization of media, with the digitization [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1127.6s)]
*  of media. And then you have this hugely unusual and extremely long campaign this year. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1131.28s)]
*  Not only that, you had his sitting president bow out, you know, the summer before the elections. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1137.2s)]
*  Let's not forget that. And his vice president, who would become the first woman, first South Asian [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1141.68s)]
*  African-American woman becoming president, all of that adds to a huge fascination. And I think it [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1146.8s)]
*  just makes this much different. The only other thing I would compare it to from my own time in [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1153.04s)]
*  sort of traveling around and covering elections was a little bit of the 2008 campaign where you [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1157.28s)]
*  had Barack Obama emerging, who ended up becoming the first black American president and his very [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1161.6s)]
*  competitive primary against Hillary Clinton, who was a globally known candidate as well. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1167.6s)]
*  And not to mention John McCain, the military hero running that had a lot of elements that fascinated [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1172.3999999999999s)]
*  the world and got a huge amount of attention. But this one is just feels even more different. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1177.2s)]
*  So we've basically been looking at uncensored news when we've been looking at it. I thought it [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1182.4s)]
*  might be good for us to take a look at what's going on in RT and Sputnik and the Global Times, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1188.6399999999999s)]
*  the Chinese sites. And these, of course, change every day. But I think it's sort of useful to see [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1196.08s)]
*  what they're putting out there, keeping in mind that they're pushing this globally, not so much [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1203.28s)]
*  domestically. But it is interesting to see the narrative. A lot of predictably about Ukraine at [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1207.12s)]
*  the top of the site right now on RT, but look for what they are talking about. Russian [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1212.8799999999999s)]
*  disinformation fighters to sue FBI, sort of turning things upside down there. Harris campaign [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1217.76s)]
*  manipulating social media, researchers says. Trump rides in garbage truck. So they're not above [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1224.08s)]
*  tweaking both sides there. That seems to be sort of have seized RT Sputnik. Here's my particular [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  favorite here, which is on the off lead right now. I suppose the left is the off lead, isn't it? On [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1238.8s)]
*  websites. I always get confused about websites. You know, yeah, yes and no. It depends on the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1243.04s)]
*  design, frankly, these days. I'm so old fashioned on this. But it looks like a newspaper here. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1250.1599999999999s)]
*  What US celebrities are endorsing Harris and what are endorsing Trump, part two and part one? That [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1256.08s)]
*  seems to be particularly fun. We could spend some time on that one here. Trump versus Harris, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1261.92s)]
*  who are the big money players supporting the candidates? Is that really a public service? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1266.4s)]
*  That wouldn't be a bad thing for us to be covering. And finally, the Global Times. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1271.04s)]
*  On the top of the site, letters from Xi, always favorite feature there. Europe should not continue [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1275.68s)]
*  down the misguided path of protectionism, which is quite interesting. This goes to the question of [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1281.8400000000001s)]
*  who would they prefer there? And that's a big part of the coverage more generally. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1286.64s)]
*  There's sort of ambivalence. Do we like Trump as the strongman versus are we going to get into a [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1291.3600000000001s)]
*  tariff war there? But not a lot of coverage right now in the Global Times about the election. You [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1296.0s)]
*  have to really sort of scroll down on it. So lots there and we really heartily suggest that people [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1300.24s)]
*  dig into these sites because I think you can learn a lot to see is it predictable, what's really [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1306.48s)]
*  going on inside the Chinese Communist Party about what shows up there? Because this is the face that [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1311.6000000000001s)]
*  they're pushing out to the world, not so much domestically, but I think you can begin to get a [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1316.24s)]
*  sense of where their anxieties as well as their enthusiasms are. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1320.16s)]
*  And Carla, I would just add to the state controlled media, somewhat slightly different, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1323.44s)]
*  a little bit more nuanced, I would say, coverage from the Middle East. So you have Al-Adha-Rabiyah, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1328.24s)]
*  the Saudi state-owned website for this paper, actually has a big countdown banner to US [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1332.72s)]
*  election on its homepage. As one would expect, a great deal of coverage on pieces related to [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1338.8s)]
*  Palestine. They cover US-based pro-Palestine groups. They have some coverage on Iranian [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1343.28s)]
*  interference in US election, which has come out of some of the US authorities reporting about [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1348.8799999999999s)]
*  Iranian hacking of various campaign sites. Al-Adha-Rabiyah, interestingly, was at the [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1353.2s)]
*  Democratic National Convention and interviewed Iranian-American actress Nazanin Noor, talking [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1358.6399999999999s)]
*  about the interests of Iranian-Americans for a Saudi audience. I think that's interesting. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1363.44s)]
*  It seems sort of remarkably right now, and granted this is a snapshot, just right this moment, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1367.28s)]
*  four days, seven hours, 28 minutes and 58 seconds, 56 seconds, 55. That countdown [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1375.28s)]
*  clock is pretty extraordinary. What's the top of the site? If you go to the US election page, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  US elections, Trump polls election stunts, Democrats fend off Biden's garbage fallout. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1386.0s)]
*  There's a picture of him in the garbage truck that seems to have really seized the imagination, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1390.1599999999999s)]
*  not an attractive way for Trump. We've got US elections, I'm not a Nazi. Trump insists [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1394.24s)]
*  as Harris blasts ugly rhetoric. We've got a lot of sort of negative on Trump. Trump accused of [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1399.68s)]
*  groping model. He met through Jeffrey Epstein. Trump campaign accuses UK's Labour Party of [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1405.44s)]
*  Election Interference. Donald Trump calls himself father of IVF at all women town hall. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1410.0s)]
*  Harris mocks Trump after rally turns into dance-a-thon. There's a lot of Trump, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1415.52s)]
*  not all that much about Harris and not particularly positive toward Trump. I don't know. What do we [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1421.0400000000002s)]
*  learn about that from, maybe it's just today, and if we were to go look at it tomorrow, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1426.88s)]
*  it would look differently. But Trump says he thinks Israel should hit Iran nuclear facilities. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1430.96s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1436.72s)]
*  So make of it what you will, but that's a snapshot from a country that had close, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1437.2800000000002s)]
*  shall we say, alignment with the Trump administration the first time around. So very interesting. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1442.0s)]
*  The tea leaves of the website. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1446.0s)]
*  Al Jazeera, Qatar owned, has always had a very big, robust presence in the United States and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1447.6s)]
*  has tried to actually mirror some of the bigger US media in some regards and some of the ways they [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1452.9599999999998s)]
*  cover things. They portrayed the Middle East view in the US. They're not seeing a great deal of [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1458.32s)]
*  difference between the two candidates at this point, according to some of their coverage. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1464.32s)]
*  They got into covering the brouhaha over the Madison Square Garden rally and have a piece [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1468.24s)]
*  titled Could Puerto Rican Voters Hurt Trump in US Election After Jive at Rally, when one of the [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1472.8s)]
*  speakers at that rally called it an island of garbage. That's become a big issue in the US. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1477.2s)]
*  A lot of Puerto Rican voters in swing state of Pennsylvania. And on and on, there's other [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1482.4s)]
*  Middle East papers we'll cover, as you would expect as well, with a real interest in who's [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1487.52s)]
*  going to potentially steer things in a different direction in the Middle East, given the real gloom [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1492.48s)]
*  over what's played out since the October 7th events of a year ago. And we've talked about [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1498.0s)]
*  that quite a bit. So again, there's a different prism from the state owned, but it's still quite [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1501.84s)]
*  a bit of resources have been applied towards trying to understand what the American voter [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1507.6s)]
*  is thinking and how that translates into the government changing anything. And one other thing [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1512.3999999999999s)]
*  I would just note in that we kicked off our affiliate podcast, Why It Matters. They kicked [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1516.9599999999998s)]
*  off their season looking at why the world was obsessed with this election, especially through [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAFbMwaj-fY&t=1522.0s)]
