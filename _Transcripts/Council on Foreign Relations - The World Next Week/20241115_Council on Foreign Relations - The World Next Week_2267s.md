Video Description: Tumultuous events have rocked the last four years: the COVID-19 pandemic, Europe’s largest land war in eighty years, and an escalating Middle Eastern conflict between Israel and Iran-backed forces. On top of that, the United States faces an intensifying geopolitical struggle with China and Russia. Now, U.S. President Joe Biden is running out of time to secure his legacy while the transition to a second Donald Trump administration comes sharply into focus. The U.S. president-elect has been quickly nominating leaders to his cabinet and receiving calls from foreign leaders. Why It Matters sits down with the hosts of The World Next Week to talk about what the United States–and a closely watching world–should expect in the weeks and months to come as incoming President Trump takes office.

# TWNW Special Why the World Next Week Matters
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE)
*  Hello listeners, this is Bob McMahon. Today we are sharing a special episode Carla and I recorded [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=0.0s)]
*  with our colleagues over at the Why It Matters podcast of CFR. Carla and I both sat down with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=5.16s)]
*  Gabrielle Sierra, the host of Why It Matters, to talk about the world next week, next month, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=10.64s)]
*  and into next year with a particular focus on the outgoing Biden administration and what the world [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=15.48s)]
*  will be keeping an eye on as the incoming president Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  time. The world next week will be back to its regularly scheduled programming next week. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=26.16s)]
*  Guys, this is the crossover that everyone has been begging for, asking for, pleading for. It's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=30.64s)]
*  finally happening. Wow. But there are no cookies. You know, we're gonna have to do it all over again [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=38.2s)]
*  with snacks. So here on Why It Matters, we spend our time focusing on why something far away matters [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=44.64s)]
*  to us at home. But today, a little more than a week after the election, we are faced with a very [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=55.5s)]
*  different question. And that's how do the results of the US election affect the rest of the world? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=61.7s)]
*  What should we be expecting in the weeks and months to come as president-elect Donald Trump [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  takes office? So today I am sitting down with the fabulous hosts of our sister podcast, The World [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=72.06s)]
*  Next Week, Robert McMahon and Carla Ann Robbins, because who better to ask what we can expect in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=79.66s)]
*  the world next week than two people who focus on it every show. So we're gonna call it Why the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=85.66s)]
*  World Next Week Matters. That's my working title for it, unless you guys have like a better... [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=91.74s)]
*  I just want to get to the world next week. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=99.94s)]
*  Though, yeah. Step one, get to the world next week. So let's kick it off. President Biden has [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=102.38s)]
*  just under 70 days left in office. That does not sound like a lot of time. So I'm just sort of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=110.61999999999999s)]
*  curious overall, what sort of things does a president usually do during their last few months [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=117.3s)]
*  in office? Well, presidents spend a lot of time worrying, hoping, building their legacy. And [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  for President Biden, who of course was a foreign policy president, this is a culmination of an [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=131.86s)]
*  extraordinary long career of thinking about national security, man born in the Cold War, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=139.58s)]
*  and who actually did an extraordinary thing, rallied, you know, Europe and the world to fight [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=145.66s)]
*  for Ukraine. So is the message I want the world here today. America is back. America is back. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=151.34s)]
*  Diplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy. And, you know, he's watching it sort of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=160.14s)]
*  unravel in front of his eyes. So I had expected that he was going to make an enormous push in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  these last few weeks to... You can't Trump-proof the alliance, but certainly he could be pushing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=174.66s)]
*  out a lot more support for Ukraine. So I'm still sitting here hoping, wondering why he's not doing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=179.82s)]
*  a lot more. I mean, we saw Tony Blinken's getting on a plane and he's going to Europe right now to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=186.34s)]
*  potentially rally the NATO alliance to be doing more. But I'm surprised there hasn't been more of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=191.06s)]
*  a push there. And I'm surprised there hasn't been more of a push on the Middle East. They don't have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=195.82s)]
*  a lot more time. And things are going to change mightily once Trump comes back. Yes. In fact, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=198.86s)]
*  you know, we're seeing the media narrative firmly, you know, focused on the Trump moves to staff up [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=203.66s)]
*  and various announcements that keep on coming. And I know we're going to talk about a lot more [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=210.78s)]
*  to come in this podcast, but that's getting more attention than what Biden is doing. And he's got [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=214.74s)]
*  a lot of things on his agenda. I mean, one of them we could, I guess we could note is in the world [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=220.9s)]
*  next week will be a group of 20 summit that Biden will be going in one of his last global stage [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=225.62s)]
*  appearances. And it's not insignificant. It's an important moment to talk to allies and competitors, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  shall we say, and other countries that are not necessarily on the side of the US in terms of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=238.02s)]
*  backing Ukraine, but are not adversaries either. And so I think there are these events that are on [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=243.66s)]
*  the calendar that are important in this period to answer your question or to respond to your [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=249.94s)]
*  question, Gabrielle. Now you have a transition happening where there's supposed to be some [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=253.66s)]
*  handoff, some sort of organized rational handoff at a time when it feels like there's a real sea [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=258.06s)]
*  change. The only thing I'll add to that is that it is a little bit odd that these two men, Trump [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=264.06s)]
*  and Biden, are roughly contemporaries in age, but very different in the way they look at the sort [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=269.14s)]
*  of traditional US role in foreign policy. And that's the real difference that you have Biden, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=275.3s)]
*  who kind of swung back the pendulum on the US approach to allies and international affairs, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=280.18s)]
*  is now looking to brace its allies and its international partners for a Trump administration [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=286.02s)]
*  that's less interested in that and more interested in really changing the status quo. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=291.86s)]
*  It almost feels as if, and I listen, maybe they'll surprise us, maybe they'll surprise us [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=296.14s)]
*  tomorrow, today, in the next few hours, but it almost feels as if they've lost their mojo. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=301.58s)]
*  Because Biden came in and said, we're back, coming after Trump. And I suspect he'll go around the G20 [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=307.06s)]
*  meeting saying to people, we haven't left yet. But the Biden administration gave Israel a deadline [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  of Tuesday, November 12th, saying, get your act together, get a lot more aid. Gaza's starving. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=321.62s)]
*  And the rule is you're only supposed to have one president at a time. This was a very clear deadline [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=327.34s)]
*  that the State Department and the Defense Department had given to the Netanyahu government. Eight [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=333.86s)]
*  agencies, independent aid agencies, said that they had made absolutely no progress at all, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=339.9s)]
*  that people are desperately, desperately hungry in Gaza. And the State Department admitted that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=345.46s)]
*  this situation was dire there, but they also said that they weren't going to do anything to pressure [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=351.3s)]
*  or punish the Israelis for not making progress. It's almost as if they threw their hands up and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=355.3s)]
*  said, well, the Trump administration is going to come in, the Netanyahu government's not going to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  listen to us. This is almost as if they've seeded space. But as I said, they could surprise us, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=363.18s)]
*  but this was an important moment, an important test of how they were going to seize this time, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=368.7s)]
*  the question you asked, and they didn't seize it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=373.22s)]
*  I guess my question is, can Biden take action in Gaza as this sort of lame duck president? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  Not to sound cold, but as you said, people really seem to have moved on and are focusing on the next [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=380.94s)]
*  administration. Should President Biden still matter to us? And does he still matter to the rest of the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=385.42s)]
*  world? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=391.14s)]
*  I don't know about Gaza. Certainly, strong moral statements could be made. But certainly for [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=392.09999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine, when the Europeans are desperate to have the United States supporting them, the Ukrainians [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=401.06s)]
*  are desperate for it. And there's a lot that they could be pushing out right now. There's a lot of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=407.62s)]
*  military that they could be pushing out. And that very critical question about whether the Ukrainians [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=411.82s)]
*  could have their hands untied so they could be striking inside of Russian territory, and particularly [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=417.74s)]
*  at this moment in which everyone's warning that the Russians with North Korean troops are about to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=422.82s)]
*  launch an attack on this Kursk region. And the Americans have been one of the main opponents to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=427.54s)]
*  allowing the Ukrainians to use these missiles to hit inside of Russian territories. Biden could say, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=434.18s)]
*  okay, I'm going to untie their hands. I'm going to lift my objections to this. And there's a lot of [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=441.46000000000004s)]
*  things they can't do to Trump-proof the policy, but that's one thing he could be doing. And he [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=448.18s)]
*  could be doing it right now. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=452.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I think Ukraine in some ways offers more opportunity for a little bit of traction [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  than the Middle East, where at least from so far, the signals from the incoming Trump administration [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=460.09999999999997s)]
*  are people who are coming in with a mindset and a firmness of views on Israel that don't seem to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=465.53999999999996s)]
*  leave a lot of daylight for a major change in US policy on, say, the humanitarian situation there. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=472.18s)]
*  Ukraine, however, you have a situation where there are some people close to Trump who also very much [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=479.06s)]
*  want to continue to support Ukraine, even while there are also others, including Trump himself, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=485.06s)]
*  that have indicated it's time to wind down the US support and come up with a deal and that it would [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=490.02s)]
*  include some sort of Russian retention of territory it has seized. But there could be some things that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=495.06s)]
*  Biden does that fine favor with senior Republicans in the US that would carry over to a Trump [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=500.42s)]
*  administration that could be done now. And the Ukraine circumstances quite different than [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=506.1s)]
*  previous historical analogies I could think of. But one that comes to mind [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=512.02s)]
*  occurred during the changeover from the Carter to the Reagan administrations, where you had [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=516.58s)]
*  this painstaking effort by the Carter administration to free the American hostages in Iran. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=521.3000000000001s)]
*  That was the abiding story. It was something that really afflicted the Carter administration, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=526.26s)]
*  but they continued to try and had efforts going on, as we learned later, sort of background [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=531.14s)]
*  efforts going on vigorously through the course of that transition in the late days of the Carter [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=536.18s)]
*  administration, such that the hostages were released, in fact, and they were released on [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  the day Reagan was inaugurated. So I still recall the headlines from the New York Times, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=545.78s)]
*  444 days later, hostages released as Reagan is sworn in. That was a nice early victory [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=550.7399999999999s)]
*  lap for the Reagan administration that it was not really involved in, but there was a sense that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=556.9s)]
*  their looming hard talk on Iran was something that was delivering dividends, perhaps. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=561.38s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Well, the Iranians were determined to deny Carter anyway. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=566.9s)]
*  Peter Van Doren And there's that aspect as well. Will Russia be of a similar mind in terms of any [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=570.02s)]
*  policies it has vis-a-vis Ukraine and Trump? It's really tough. The question is, what is [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=576.02s)]
*  Biden willing to do at this point, at a time when Russia seems like it's tasting a chance to really [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=580.5s)]
*  change facts on the ground further? And we had talked a week ago about the situation involving [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=586.9s)]
*  a potential Trump-Putin discussion about the situation on the ground. It's interesting that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=593.38s)]
*  there was or was not a call between Trump and Putin in which Trump laid out some markers about [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=598.74s)]
*  not going on the offensive. Donald Trump A lot of people, the number of people dying [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=604.74s)]
*  in the Ukraine-Russia war is a far greater number than anybody knows. And Biden has done nothing [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=609.62s)]
*  about it. He hasn't even spoken to Putin in over a year, known nothing about it. And this is a war [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=615.22s)]
*  that has to end and we're going to get that war ended. I'm going to try and I think I can get it [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=621.0600000000001s)]
*  ended as president-elect. In other words, before I even take over the White House. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=625.86s)]
*  Peter Van Doren The Russians deny that ever happened and in denying it have also ramped up [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=629.94s)]
*  their plans for an offensive. So it's just, this is going to be a really interesting front to watch. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=638.26s)]
*  And there's a ton at stake, as Carla said. Carly [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=643.7s)]
*  and the G7, even though they still represent nominally seven leading industrial democracies [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=673.7s)]
*  in the world have receded in influence. The G20 is all the major players, counting for something [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=678.1s)]
*  like 85% of global economic output for starters. And it's not just democracies, it's China, it's [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  Russia. It won't be Russia's leader because Vladimir Putin is under a arrest warrant for war crimes in [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=689.3000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine. And President Lula, while himself saying Putin could attend Rio, could not assure that he [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=694.58s)]
*  would not be seized and brought up charges in other courts in Brazil. So Putin is not going. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=700.58s)]
*  Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister is going, just like I believe he, Lavrov was the one who [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=706.74s)]
*  attended last year's last couple of big summits that have occurred since this warrant came down [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=711.46s)]
*  for Putin. So it's the place where the players are. And it's part of a flurry of year end [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=716.74s)]
*  summit tree that's really important. There's also an APEC summit coming up. There was just a BRIC [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=723.14s)]
*  summit that Russia itself hosted. It got a lot of attention as this kind of alternative to western [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=728.26s)]
*  led international organizations, although it still hasn't come up with it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=734.1s)]
*  Financial organizations, yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=736.98s)]
*  Certainly financial organizations, although it still hasn't come up with any sort of firm [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=738.5s)]
*  structure or a financial plan. But it is a challenge and G20 will continue this messaging [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=742.66s)]
*  about the world dominated by the World Bank and the IMF and the WTO needs to change and we need [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=748.02s)]
*  to offer alternatives. What's interesting, I noted earlier that it's fourth time in a row, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=754.1s)]
*  it's going to be a country from the so-called global south hosting it. And India and Brazil [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=759.86s)]
*  have asserted themselves as previous and current host as agenda setters and they're very much [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=764.9s)]
*  sending the agenda about ending poverty and equality. One of this year's big themes is food [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=772.4200000000001s)]
*  security and hunger elimination. A reminder that it's not just America's being upset over [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=777.22s)]
*  food inflation. There's parts of the world that are really worried about the availability of food, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=782.7399999999999s)]
*  let alone the cost of it. We're seeing this problem and both war induced, climate induced, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=786.66s)]
*  and other things as adding to food insecurity around the world. And so the G20 nations could [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=792.42s)]
*  actually play a role in this in terms of taking steps. India set in motion a whole series of [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=797.4599999999999s)]
*  types of efforts to try to bolster global organizations and scientific research into [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=802.5s)]
*  fertilizers and to market transparency and global supply chains, all the nuts and bolts that lead to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=808.26s)]
*  the availability of food. So maybe G20 could be a practical source for dealing with something like [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=813.54s)]
*  that. So it is a venue of importance. You have a major attendee being a lame duck president. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=818.74s)]
*  It's going to be very interesting to see how he's regarded, what kind of conversations he has on the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=825.06s)]
*  sidelines, who he ends up talking with more than others. All this is going to be on display in [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=828.34s)]
*  Brazil, which itself is about to host a number of important meetings. It'll host the next COP [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=834.34s)]
*  meeting on climate. By the way, the COP on climate in Azerbaijan is continuing to play out, a little [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=839.14s)]
*  bit of crossover in two major global events. And it's not as well attended as the G20 will be with [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=843.86s)]
*  leaders. And Brazil is also going to host the next BRICS meeting. So it's important to look at the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=849.7800000000001s)]
*  host. It's important to look at who's showing up and then the extent to which they regard the current [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=854.26s)]
*  US administration and what is the talk of the incoming Trump administration? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=859.38s)]
*  AMT – The G20 is a particularly interesting phenomenon because when you think about the G7, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=863.4599999999999s)]
*  which was one more, you know, we're the big kids. When you think of all the institutions that were [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=870.5799999999999s)]
*  created in the wake of World War II, they were victors' clubs and they were basically colonialist [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=876.18s)]
*  clubs. And they made sense to a certain extent in the mid-1940s. But, you know, the world changed [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=883.22s)]
*  and the world economies changed. And the G20 came along and the recognition, I think, to a great [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=891.5400000000001s)]
*  extent with the Obama administration, I think I'm right, Bob, to say and to a great extent with the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=898.98s)]
*  financial crisis, that you weren't going to dig back out without the participation of these other [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=905.7s)]
*  economies. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=910.74s)]
*  BD – No, in fact, it's important to note that period that the G20 really kind of emerged because [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=911.62s)]
*  there was a declaration at the G20 that they were going to work against protectionism. And it was an [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=915.7s)]
*  important signal that really, I think, you saw it palpably affect the way the world reacted, markets [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=921.54s)]
*  reacted. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=927.54s)]
*  AMT – And Obama got it in a pretty fundamental way. At the same time, they didn't really [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=927.9399999999999s)]
*  fundamentally change the voting structure. They haven't changed the voting structure of the UN [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=932.82s)]
*  Security Council. They didn't change the voting structure significantly at the IMF, at the World [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=936.1s)]
*  Bank. You know, they still have these rules here in which the IMF is still always run by a European. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=940.9s)]
*  The World Bank is still always run by an American. There's a lot of reasons for why these emerging [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=946.26s)]
*  big economies, whether it's Indonesia or whether it's Brazil or it's South Africa, these players [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=952.26s)]
*  that come along say, you know, India, why don't we have a seat here? So the G20 is important. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=957.38s)]
*  And I think it's really important right now because what we've seen with the war in Ukraine, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=963.7s)]
*  these countries should see Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a palpable threat to them as well. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=968.34s)]
*  But they don't. At least they don't describe it that way. And there's a lot of what aboutism [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=973.86s)]
*  there. There's a lot, you know, how come you got to invade Iraq and now why are you complaining [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=978.82s)]
*  about Russia? There's a lot of work that needs to be done. And the expectation, I think, is that a [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=983.7s)]
*  continuation of a Biden administration, a Harris administration, to deal with, which is a pretty [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=990.66s)]
*  fundamental problem, which is this alienation of countries that are not necessarily in Russia's [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=995.54s)]
*  camp, but that sat on the sidelines with the Ukraine war. I don't think you're going to see [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1000.98s)]
*  that with the Trump administration. So this is a serious challenge to what is, quote, referred to [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1005.6999999999999s)]
*  as the rules-based world order. And I think we ignore that at our peril. And President Biden [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1012.26s)]
*  gets it, but I don't think they had the time and the space to deal with it. I don't think they've [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1020.9s)]
*  dealt with it nearly enough. Going back to the days after the election, I guess we could say, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1024.66s)]
*  going back to the world last week, we saw many world leaders, and I'm sure you guys have discussed [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1028.98s)]
*  this at length, but from Bibi to Putin call up President-elect Trump and congratulate him on his [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1033.94s)]
*  win. It feels like all of this happened really fast. Maybe I'm wrong, but it just feels really [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1039.54s)]
*  fast. It's already reported that he had talks with President Zelensky of Ukraine. Trump has also told [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1046.6599999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu that he wants the war in Gaza over before he's sworn in in January. Is it unusual [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1053.62s)]
*  for Trump to be acting like a sitting president? And that's, I mean, those phone calls are normal. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1060.1s)]
*  Keep in mind, President Trump has already been president, so that adds a different quality to [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1066.26s)]
*  it. He knows all these people, and if they're treating him like a president, he's already been [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1071.62s)]
*  president. And I think that does change the interaction to a certain extent. And President [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1077.3s)]
*  Trump said he wanted things settled or that he was going to settle things on day one or before [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1085.2199999999998s)]
*  he came in. We still don't have plans on that. So I don't consider any of that, but that does also [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1090.1s)]
*  go back to this. You can't have two presidents at the same time. I don't think the White House is [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1094.82s)]
*  asserting itself all the things that we were talking about before. The thing that has happened [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1098.66s)]
*  incredibly quickly is this naming of people to his cabinet. I've never seen anything happen this [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1104.42s)]
*  quickly. It's extraordinary. It is, to use a cliche, head spinning. So I'm curious, Bob, what can [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1110.1000000000001s)]
*  Trump's first presidency tell us about a second Trump administration? It's an interesting question. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1118.74s)]
*  It's one that you can't really answer properly with someone like Trump because he will change [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1126.26s)]
*  on a dime his position, depending on all sorts of factors. And then added to that, you have this [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1131.62s)]
*  fairly long transition period between election day and inauguration day. Trump was ready to come out [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1136.66s)]
*  of the gates with proposals, which differed from his first presidency. I think we're fully expecting [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1142.18s)]
*  changes, but we also are waiting to see what else could be guiding Trump. What will ultimately be [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1147.3799999999999s)]
*  his goal in Ukraine? Is it ending the war there? Is it being able to walk away, being able to say [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1154.42s)]
*  that he ended it quickly? Or is he going to come up with a new set of parameters for defining success [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1160.02s)]
*  in Ukraine, as in the Middle East? I don't know. He did seem to talk about wars quite a lot on the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1166.1000000000001s)]
*  campaign trail and again on his victory speech on election night. What a strong and powerful [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1171.14s)]
*  military and ideally we don't have to use it. We had no wars for years. We had no wars, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1176.66s)]
*  except we defeated ISIS. We defeated ISIS in record time. But we had no wars. They said, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1182.26s)]
*  he will start a war. I'm not going to start a war. I'm going to stop wars. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1190.34s)]
*  But this is also a massive victory for democracy and for freedom. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1193.94s)]
*  LARSON One thinks that he might be able to move forward with that rather quickly. Those are [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1198.18s)]
*  some of the announcements he's already made would affect that. There certainly seemed to be a wave [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1203.62s)]
*  of tariffs coming. Trump talked about it repeatedly. Whether it ends up focusing more on China than any [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1208.02s)]
*  other country is not clear yet. But he seems especially enamored of tariffs and he's lining [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1213.3s)]
*  up people who support those views. LARSON Carla, who has been nominated to be in Trump's cabinet [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1218.42s)]
*  so far? And who should we be keeping an eye on, you think? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1226.26s)]
*  CARLA Well, there seems to be a significant difference between the people, as Bob said, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1230.26s)]
*  he chose on the first term and now. And certainly this was telegraphed for a long time. I mean, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1234.82s)]
*  the first term he chose people with clear expertise and people who were willing on more [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1239.7s)]
*  than one occasion to slap his hand away and to check his impulses. I mean, when you think about [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1245.86s)]
*  his defense secretary, I mean, retired General James Mattis, you think about quite a few national [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1251.46s)]
*  security advisors. But, you know, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, John Bolton is a national [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1256.98s)]
*  security advisor. And these were people with significant expertise and judging from the things [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1261.14s)]
*  they wrote afterwards, these were people who were ultimately trying to train him and ultimately [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1266.18s)]
*  trying to frustrate him. You know, this time there is, when we're looking at the people he's [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1270.26s)]
*  announced and the people we expect him to announce, there's less experience. And while some of them [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1275.0600000000002s)]
*  come from a more traditional Reagan slash Neocon background, they seem to have become serious [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1281.38s)]
*  converts to, you know, Trumpism and their loyalty is to Trump and to at least what they say, the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1287.86s)]
*  MAGA worldview. The one who has yet to be announced, what everyone expects as the secretary of state is [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1294.02s)]
*  Florida Senator Marco Rubio. He's probably the person who has the most background. I mean, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1299.62s)]
*  he serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, ranking on the Intelligence Committee. He ran [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1305.3799999999999s)]
*  against Trump before being converted to the cause. And at the time he was vowing that he was, you [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1309.9399999999998s)]
*  know, very much a traditional Reagan internationalist. And interestingly, he co-sponsored this [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1315.38s)]
*  legislation last year, even after he'd become a Trump ally that requires congressional approval [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1320.42s)]
*  for withdrawal from NATO. And there's no question that that legislation was clearly aimed at then [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1325.3000000000002s)]
*  former and now future President Trump. He was also a really strong supporter for Ukraine aid when [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1330.8200000000002s)]
*  Russia first invaded, although he voted against the latest package saying that the U.S. needed to spend [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1336.5800000000002s)]
*  more money on securing the U.S. border. So whether he is secretly a Ukraine supporter, he's certainly [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1341.7s)]
*  fiercely anti-China, anti-Iran. And so when you consider this sort of axis of disruptors who are [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1348.5s)]
*  supporting the Russians in Ukraine, you know, it's sort of hard to imagine that you're anti-China and [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1356.9s)]
*  you're pro-giving Russia a big part of Ukraine. And we'll have to see about that. Interestingly, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1362.98s)]
*  if confirmed, Rubio would be the first secretary of state under Beijing sanctions and banned from [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1369.14s)]
*  traveling to China. So he's, you know, which is sort of an interesting thing because he sponsored [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1373.38s)]
*  this bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which puts sanctions on Chinese, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1378.74s)]
*  which the Chinese didn't like. And then there's Mike Walz, who Trump has chosen to be national [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1382.5800000000002s)]
*  security advisor. He's certainly a less well-known quantity, but he brings some knowledge. He's a [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1387.5400000000002s)]
*  former Green Beret. He's a current Florida congressman, serves on armed services, foreign [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1392.3400000000001s)]
*  affairs and intelligence. He also was an early supporter of aid to Ukraine. And he also says, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1396.82s)]
*  no, no, no, now it's all about China. He's a big China hawk as well. And the big puzzle for me, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1402.82s)]
*  and I'm sure for Bob and for everyone else is Pete Hegseth, who was just announced. He is a Fox [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1409.3s)]
*  news host. He served in the army in Afghanistan, Iraq and at Guantanamo Bay. He is an utterly [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1415.62s)]
*  fierce Trump loyalist. He has none of the experience in strategy or in management that [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1421.62s)]
*  one would expect from a defense chief. I mean, there are a lot of people he's going to have to [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1426.8999999999999s)]
*  be managing there and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars that they've [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1430.7399999999998s)]
*  got to worry about. And if you want to compete seriously against the Russians and the Chinese, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1435.2199999999998s)]
*  this is a massive industry you have to deal with here. And as the New York Times put it delicately, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1440.4199999999998s)]
*  it was a choice outside the norm. Hegseth is best known outside his Fox gig, including he is the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1446.02s)]
*  host for their New Year's Eve coverage. He lobbied vocally for this Navy SEAL, Edward Gallagher, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1453.1399999999999s)]
*  who was accused of war crimes in Iraq. Gallagher was acquitted after Hegseth pushed his case on [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1459.94s)]
*  Fox. Trump stepped in and reversed his demotion, which was a punishment he got for posing with a [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1465.54s)]
*  corpse and also fired the Navy secretary who was involved in the case. And Hegseth is also known [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1470.26s)]
*  for being fiercely opposed to what he and Trump call woke generals. And I saw this quote in the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1477.22s)]
*  Washington Post, which really blew me away, asked in a podcast interview that was published last [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1482.58s)]
*  week. Hegseth said, quote, first of all, you've got to fire the chairman and joint chiefs and you [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1487.22s)]
*  got to fire this. I mean, obviously you can bring in a new secretary of defense, but any general that [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1493.54s)]
*  was involved, general admiral, whatever that was involved in any of the DEI woke, it's got to go. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1496.98s)]
*  It's also worth noting that Hegseth is a former decorated veteran and has made a big point of [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1506.18s)]
*  being against deployments of US forces abroad while still, you know, speaking toughly about [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1511.54s)]
*  US national security and defense writ large. That one in particular is going to be worth [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1516.5s)]
*  watching very closely as it proceeds through the approval process. And two things in particular [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1523.54s)]
*  to watch are this attempt to crack down on the leadership. And if we're looking at anything [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1529.78s)]
*  close to like a purge of military leadership, that would be stunning for all sorts of reasons, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1534.18s)]
*  something you don't see outside of authoritarian states usually, as well as, you know, there have [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1539.38s)]
*  been a lot of reports about Trump wanting to have a some sort of a loyalty test with like a swearing [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1545.54s)]
*  of military leadership to loyalty to him. It's not far fetched that that could emerge from this. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1552.58s)]
*  He had in his first administration wanted to be able to deploy military domestically to put down [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1558.5s)]
*  protests. These types of things happen. These are not just outside the norm. They are norm busting [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1563.22s)]
*  and alarming. And there were reasons why there were rules governing those put into place. So [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1568.34s)]
*  we're looking at a real change in structure and mission that could be earth shattering, say the [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1574.02s)]
*  least for someone who's gained a great deal of attention because he can articulate policies that [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1579.94s)]
*  Trump very much embraces and has done so repeatedly on Fox News, but has not shown the capacity to [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1585.22s)]
*  run an organization like the Pentagon. And again, this is an election about changing the status quo, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1590.8200000000002s)]
*  but I'm not sure this is the type of change that is going to be sought after. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1595.46s)]
*  I mean, there's some other interesting choices. I mean, Representative Elise Stefanik from New [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1598.74s)]
*  York as ambassador to UN, she doesn't have foreign policy experience, but she's got a very strong [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1604.18s)]
*  voice. So we'll see. She was known for confronting these Ivy League presidents and anti-Semitism on [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1608.74s)]
*  campus, got a lot of attention. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee has incredibly close ties [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1613.86s)]
*  with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he's also, he's going to feed the far right [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1619.22s)]
*  in Israel. He said he personally believed Israel had the right to annex parts of the West Bank. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1625.54s)]
*  And he's been nominated for ambassador to Israel, right? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1630.18s)]
*  Yes. He said for that, 2008 in a presidential run, he said there's [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1632.9s)]
*  really no such thing as a Palestinian. I mean, those sort of things are going to come up and [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1637.62s)]
*  not play well as you might imagine. And then his borders are, which is obviously an absolutely [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1641.46s)]
*  central, you know, with tariffs of the other big, big Trump policy and the claim that he's going to [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1648.02s)]
*  deport millions and millions of undocumented. He was the acting director of ICE and he oversaw [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1653.22s)]
*  the family separation policy. And while we can see that as solely a domestic policy, but that has [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1659.7s)]
*  huge international implications as well. And then you've got Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1665.46s)]
*  who is also going to be the head of Homeland Security. She sent National Guard to the border, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1670.9s)]
*  which is how she made her bones for that job. But two things, I mean, Homeland Security is a lot [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1676.42s)]
*  more than just immigration. It's counterterrorism, it's cybersecurity, it's FEMA, it's Coast Guard, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1681.54s)]
*  it's the Secret Service. It's a very, very big job. I suppose as a governor, she's, you know, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1686.58s)]
*  run things, but it's not an easy job. Trump had six heads of Homeland Security in his first term. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1691.06s)]
*  That's a big job. So we'll see how she does it. Looking globally, this past year was dubbed the [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1696.58s)]
*  year of elections. So as we look back, I'm curious, are there any elections that we saw happen that [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1701.86s)]
*  carry as much importance globally as ours? It's hard to compare it to the U.S. because everybody [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1708.34s)]
*  was waiting for this one. And now that it's arrived, it is as expected, having quite a bit of [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1714.74s)]
*  impact and will be for many months now. But I think we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1720.5s)]
*  there were important elections, just looking at Europe alone. There were important elections in [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1726.1s)]
*  France, where it looks like it was a shockwave election, which the right advanced, but not [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1730.1s)]
*  enough to formally step into power. So you have Macron kind of clinging to a sort of power there, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1735.62s)]
*  but he could suffer another defeat in the next round of elections when his term comes up and [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1742.9s)]
*  Marine Le Pen is poised to take over. So we're not clear whether the U.S. elections will continue [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1746.74s)]
*  to have effect into places like Europe and beyond. But France was an interesting time in which the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1752.26s)]
*  country cast a protest vote, but not enough of one to totally turn the tables. UK was a vote, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1758.26s)]
*  counter-trend vote, where you have the labor getting power after the Tories mucked things up [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1765.14s)]
*  for a number of years. But then I think it's interesting to look at places like India, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1769.78s)]
*  where Narendra Modi was seemingly poised to continue to cement his Hindu nationalist agenda [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1773.86s)]
*  and seize control of further levers of Indian society. And in fact, took a bit of a loss there [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1779.54s)]
*  and has to rule in coalition. He still is in a position of power and influence, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1785.2199999999998s)]
*  but it was a bit of a step back for him that was not expected and kind of caught people by surprise. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1790.1799999999998s)]
*  And then you have places like Japan, which had a big protest vote as well, which is not necessarily [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1797.62s)]
*  a defeat for democracy, maybe a sign of strength of democracy, where you had the post-war ruling [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1802.34s)]
*  part of the LDP has to step down or find some sort of way of ruling an unprecedented coalition [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1806.58s)]
*  to stay in power because of the way the vote went there. It was definitely a protest vote and also [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1812.6599999999999s)]
*  for really domestic oriented reasons, but still kind of worth watching. So I think it's going to [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1818.4199999999998s)]
*  be a mixed picture globally. It certainly was a year of populism by all accounts, but there were [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1824.02s)]
*  some interesting other plot lines to look at. Yeah, I was going to say what trends has really [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1830.26s)]
*  stood out to you guys as you look at all these results. I think all of these and listening to [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1835.54s)]
*  what Bob's description of this is that this was basically throw the you know what's out every [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1840.66s)]
*  place and labor came in in the UK, the right nearly came in in France, South Africa ruling [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1846.18s)]
*  coalition for the ANC. And you know, we're seeing enormous analysis here in the United States. Was [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1853.86s)]
*  it too much identity politics? Have the Democrats lost touch completely with working class with [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1862.1799999999998s)]
*  Hispanics with this with that? Maybe or maybe is this really what's happened everywhere, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1867.6999999999998s)]
*  which is after the pandemic, after inflation for the first time in a really long time, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1874.8999999999999s)]
*  people just wanted to change, which doesn't mean that the Democratic Party and other parties don't [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1879.7s)]
*  have to take a really hard look at what they're selling and what they're not listening to out [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1885.46s)]
*  there. But if there's one trend, I think after this year of elections is that people just want to [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1890.18s)]
*  change just anybody who was in basically got pushed out or nearly pushed out. People didn't [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1896.42s)]
*  like what their governments were giving them. And I think inflation was a big part of it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1902.42s)]
*  I think that's true. I think that's maybe the leading trend line to take note of. I would also [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1906.98s)]
*  say that populists mostly from the right but not exclusively were particularly good at using social [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1912.18s)]
*  media platforms to make their case and to advance them and that traditional media are in many places, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1919.22s)]
*  certainly the US are not holding the sway that they have in past cycles. And so this is something [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1926.18s)]
*  that definitely needs to be watched. Now, candidates for national office need to be aware of [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1932.02s)]
*  where people are getting their information from down to local levels, down to regional levels, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1936.82s)]
*  and not just assuming that the well-known media names, brands are the ones to go to just because [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1942.18s)]
*  they've always been the ones to go to. You got to look further and it's a lot of work and populists [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1948.9s)]
*  have worked harder in a number of places and have been able to repeat certain lines so often, even [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1953.7s)]
*  lines that are patently not true or patently false, that they continue to be repeated by people who [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1959.78s)]
*  vote and came out of the voting booth saying why they voted the way they did. So I think that [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1965.78s)]
*  combination of elements was really compelling this year. So you produce a special at the end [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1970.3400000000001s)]
*  of every year called The World Next Year. So I don't want to give away the good stuff, but are [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1974.98s)]
*  there a few things you think we will be seeing early next year that directly reflect who we are [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1980.82s)]
*  electing as president? I think the year will kick off obviously with the inauguration in [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1987.86s)]
*  third week or so January of President Trump and the tone and the whole atmospherics around that [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=1993.1399999999999s)]
*  will be really important. Again, with the pace that we've discussed of him naming people to [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2002.1s)]
*  important high-level posts already being set, that is going to give him a chance to hit the ground [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2007.3s)]
*  running. And then we will see what that means in terms of drastic moves like, let's say, setting [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2013.06s)]
*  really high tariff walls or deporting millions of people in a fell swoop. Is it really going to [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2020.8999999999999s)]
*  happen in that way? Is it going to be more slowly walked out? Is there going to be rhetoric ahead [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2026.5s)]
*  of any action? Those are things I'm going to be looking for because they have huge effect tariffs [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2030.58s)]
*  worldwide, certainly, but also deportations certainly within this hemisphere are going to [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2036.1799999999998s)]
*  be something that countries are watching and that sets a tone. And the president-elect made no bones [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2041.46s)]
*  about what his priorities were. He harped on them on the campaign trail repeatedly. He was elected [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2047.22s)]
*  with a wave. His party is going to control the Senate and likely the House. And so he's coming [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2053.2200000000003s)]
*  into office with a seemingly a mandate of sorts. But it is a, by all accounts, the demographics of [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2058.82s)]
*  the support for Trump don't necessarily seem like they would support some of these sweeping moves, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2064.42s)]
*  but that will be worth watching too in terms of the U.S. domestic response, which isn't always [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2068.66s)]
*  in lockstep. I'm going to be watching to see how much the new administration goes about dismantling [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2073.3799999999997s)]
*  democratic norms. As much as President Trump said he never read the Project 2025, we're hearing from [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2082.66s)]
*  a lot of people around them this notion of, are they really going to go after the civil service, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2090.8199999999997s)]
*  after the deep state. I thought it was really intriguing in this race for the Senate majority [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2095.14s)]
*  leader that President Trump insisted that they all agree that he could make appointments [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2101.54s)]
*  in theory without Senate confirmation. That is fundamentally not the way it's done in our democracy. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2109.7s)]
*  And this notion that the Senate would willingly go into recess for recess appointments, giving up [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2117.3799999999997s)]
*  its right for advice and consent is a pretty extraordinary thing. And then you saw willy-nilly. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2122.42s)]
*  The three contenders go, yes, okay, we'll do it for the sake of having this job. If we see [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2128.1800000000003s)]
*  this process, normally you'd see a new administration would come in and then you'd [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2134.7400000000002s)]
*  have this long debate about whether these people who they're nominating are really up to the job [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2138.26s)]
*  and are going to serve the people well. And you'd have hearings and policies would be debated in the [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2143.38s)]
*  hearings and Congress is the people's voice. They're supposed to be inserting themselves [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2148.98s)]
*  in a debate over policy itself. The notion that somehow a new president would come in and cut the [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2153.78s)]
*  people's voice out of this and as an act of complete loyalty to field to a president. That to me is, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2159.2200000000003s)]
*  you know, an example of are we going to really forego not just norms, but the basic balance of [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2166.1800000000003s)]
*  power, checks and balances. That's one of the things I'm going to be watching, not just in the [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2172.9s)]
*  confirmation process, but across the entire new administration. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2177.38s)]
*  Well, thank you guys for running through all of this with me. I know there's a lot ahead [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVEPyAoxCvE&t=2180.6600000000003s)]
