# NATO and Ukraine Beyond 75, Japan Hosts Pacific Islands, France’s Political Gridlock, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA)
*  In the coming week, an anxious NATO tries to build on the post-summit momentum. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=0.0s)]
*  Japan hosts Pacific Island leaders amid rising competition with China, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=5.28s)]
*  and France considers the cost of political deadlock. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=9.28s)]
*  It's July 11, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=12.32s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Karl-Anne Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=28.0s)]
*  Karl, let's start right here in Washington, where as we were taping this podcast, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=29.44s)]
*  leaders of the Transatlantic Alliance were wrapping things up. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=34.08s)]
*  Not only is this a major anniversary for the Alliance, 75 years, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=37.52s)]
*  it's also the first time Sweden was attending as a member. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  There have been a great deal of comments in support of Ukraine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=43.52s)]
*  Very strong communique, which I'll let you address how you'd like as well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=48.0s)]
*  Which I actually read it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=52.96s)]
*  Which I know you read it. That's why I'm leaving it to you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=54.16s)]
*  But there are concerns that the circumstances facing some of the key NATO members, such as the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=57.04s)]
*  US, Germany, and France, to name a few, could be affecting their ability or their resolve in the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=62.08s)]
*  year and years ahead. So how is NATO looking for the future 75 years, Carla? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=68.72s)]
*  Well, Bob, pretty much everything at this NATO summit, and I suspect this is going to continue [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=75.92s)]
*  in the weeks and months ahead, has been overshadowed by one thing, and that's US [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=80.72s)]
*  politics and this perceived implosion of Joe Biden's presidential campaign after [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=85.52s)]
*  his disastrous debate performance. And national security is all about planning. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=91.12s)]
*  You can't plan for everything, but NATO has planning staff. And trying to what officials [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=96.24s)]
*  are calling Trump-proof the Alliance. That is sound planning. But I'm not sure how much can be [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=102.4s)]
*  guaranteed for all they're trying to do. One of the big deliverables of the summit was NATO's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=108.56s)]
*  statement that Ukraine is now on a quote, irreversible path to membership. Although there [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=113.36s)]
*  are still no dates attached or actual process. But even before the NATO communique with its [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=118.4s)]
*  carefully negotiated wording was released, Elbridge Colby, who's a senior official in the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=124.16s)]
*  Trump Pentagon and who will likely be back if Trump wins in November, told Politico that the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  commitment to NATO membership for Ukraine was of course quote, reversible. And while the 32 NATO [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=133.84s)]
*  leaders were meeting in DC, former President Trump was out on the campaign trail attacking the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=140.0s)]
*  Alliance, complaining to his supporters about how the US was footing all the bills and retelling [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=144.24s)]
*  that story. But how his president, he told the leader of an unknown NATO member that he would [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=148.56s)]
*  not defend his country, that there would be no Article 5 all for one, one for all commitment. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=153.2s)]
*  Wouldn't defend the country from Russia if the country wasn't meeting its military spending [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=158.32s)]
*  targets. So you got the split screen and as much as people were celebrating this incredibly [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=162.16s)]
*  successful military Alliance and focusing very much on what it could do to continue to support [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=168.24s)]
*  Ukraine, no matter what happens in Washington, what happens in Washington was the major focus [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=173.04s)]
*  of what was happening. Yeah, absolutely. And I would also add in terms of a future Trump [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=178.16s)]
*  administration, it would be interesting to see how it might differ from the first Trump [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=184.48s)]
*  administration in terms of there was quite a bit of pushback on his efforts to walk away from NATO [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=188.88s)]
*  commitments or even symbolically do so. And there are definitely ongoing members of the Republican [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=194.4s)]
*  Party who openly support Trump, who also are strong backers of NATO. That's still sort of unresolved [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  tension that would play out. It doesn't help the Alliance. It certainly doesn't help the spirit of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=205.28s)]
*  unity that they're trying to convey at this upcoming summit. There is that Trump proof aspect, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=210.56s)]
*  absolutely with the commitment to spending 2% of GDP. We heard at a CFR event this week from [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=215.44s)]
*  the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who basically said, regardless of who's president, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=221.84s)]
*  Europeans have to do a lot more and they have to do it now. They have to do it yesterday. She was [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=226.72s)]
*  emphatic that these countries need to step up more on their own defense commitments on supporting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=231.68s)]
*  Ukraine. She was really strong on supporting Ukraine's air defenses. And we heard within the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=237.28s)]
*  day of her speaking at CFR some new commitments to providing air defense systems for Ukraine. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=242.32s)]
*  So we'll see whether Europe steps up and whether any of this sort of Trump proofing can happen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=248.0s)]
*  There's going to be a new NATO secretary general coming in, former Dutch leader Rutte, who was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=252.32s)]
*  very much seized of this issue as well. So lots of interesting sort of things percolating. And [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=257.04s)]
*  as you say, it all comes back to the Biden question and that's going to certainly play out even as [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  this podcast is dropping. Yes, because Biden is having his post-summit press conference and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=268.56s)]
*  she was supposed of course to be about NATO and it's going to be one more litmus test about [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=275.92s)]
*  whether he's up to the job. And you really have to feel at this point, this is absurd because [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=279.52s)]
*  none of us can be perfect. I mean, I'm going to stumble over my words in this podcast. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=285.6s)]
*  And I'm not taking a position here at this point about whether Biden should go or stay, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=290.48s)]
*  but this is this constant watching and it is diverting attention from these questions here [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=294.4s)]
*  about the future of NATO and certainly the future of the commitment to Ukraine. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  There were major commitments made here. Many of them focused on Trump proofing. They're going to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=303.12s)]
*  shift to Europe, the planning apparatus for supporting Ukraine. They're going to set up [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=308.56s)]
*  this military. We talked about this before, this military structure in some of it in Ukraine. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  There's going to be a NATO civilian in Kiev and then also planning structure that's going to be [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=318.0s)]
*  in Germany. These long promise F-16s are supposed to arrive this summer. They're going to give them [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=323.04s)]
*  more Patriots, finally not as many as Zelensky himself wants, which are absolutely essential [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=328.08s)]
*  with all these glide bombs arriving. They still this unresolved question about how far into [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=333.52s)]
*  Russian territory they're allowed to shoot with the equipment that we've already given them. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  But there's a lot that they gave Ukraine and Zelensky seemed reasonably satisfied with it, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=343.2s)]
*  including with this irreversible commitment. But let's face it, nothing is irreversible and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=348.16s)]
*  everybody's holding their breath to see what happens with American politics. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=354.16s)]
*  One other thing that did happen, which was really quite interesting and we'll have to see how it [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=358.16s)]
*  plays out. For the first time, NATO bluntly said to the Chinese, stop enabling the Russians. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  And they put it into the communique. Now, they didn't say you're giving them weapons directly, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=370.16s)]
*  but you're giving them everything to build the weapons. They're very concerned about it. We've [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=375.12s)]
*  talked about this a lot. They put it down in the communique. They didn't say what they were going [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=378.88s)]
*  to do to punish the Chinese for it. And the Europeans have a lot of choices to make on [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=384.0s)]
*  sanctions, sanctioning individual companies and individuals, how much they're going to push back. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  But the Americans have persuaded the Europeans that this is a really serious problem and that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=392.32s)]
*  the Russians, part of the Russian success is the fact that they've been able to continue here [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=397.04s)]
*  is because of Chinese enabling. So that was one of the big things and it was in the communique [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=402.72s)]
*  right there. No, you're absolutely right to point that out. And it raises questions of NATO's Asia [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=406.56s)]
*  future and so forth. We don't have to get ahead of ourselves there, but it is worth noting the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=413.36s)]
*  European attitudes changing. And I mean, a critical mass of European countries have been much more [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=417.68s)]
*  critical of the Chinese relationship. And it's not just because of its support of Ukraine, it's also [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  trade measures, it's dumping of let's say renewable energy products and things like that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=428.08s)]
*  There's a lot of fresh and challenging scrutiny of China that's going on and it looks like it [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=432.56s)]
*  will intensify. So watch this issue in particular. Which is a good segue to our next topic, which [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=437.92s)]
*  we need to move to, but there's so much else we could talk about the NATO Summit of defense [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  commitments. And we're going to be talking about that a lot in the weeks to come. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=448.08s)]
*  So Bob, let's move to Japan. Next Tuesday, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will host the 10th Pacific [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=451.52s)]
*  Islands Leaders Meeting. And China has been courting Pacific Island countries like Vanuatu [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=457.76s)]
*  and the Solomon Islands. What are they able to offer to counterbalance that push by Beijing? And [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=463.68s)]
*  are these countries ready to buy whatever the Japanese are offering? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=469.76s)]
*  You know, when you look at the Pacific Islands sphere these days, Carla, it sort of overtones [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=474.08s)]
*  of what used to be called the great game, which was this 19th century competition from great powers [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=478.4s)]
*  in I think mostly Central Asia competing for hearts and minds and resources of that part of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=483.68s)]
*  the world. Definitely overtones of that though. These are 18 countries that are overall part of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  this Pacific Islands leadership meeting now. They have a regular meeting that takes place every year. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=494.08s)]
*  This particular meeting though is one that occurs every few years and it's significant that it's [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=498.64s)]
*  being hosted by Tokyo. Not just Japan that is part of this big competitive move though. I would say [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=504.08s)]
*  Australia, which is part of this meeting, is playing a really stepped up role and it's really [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=509.92s)]
*  it's even much closer physically to a lot of these islands and has considered them part of a sphere [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=514.16s)]
*  of influence anyway. And by the way, we should note an affiliated think tank, the Loewi Institute, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=518.96s)]
*  does a great job of sort of tracking aid, the ramping up of aid to Pacific Island nations. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=524.08s)]
*  And so China is a player here. China is moving in, interestingly, in one area in particular, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=529.44s)]
*  helping their police forces. So you mentioned Solomon Islands in the past years. China signed a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=535.12s)]
*  police cooperation deal. They're also offered security support to Tonga. And Kiribati is looking [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=541.52s)]
*  like it's going to get involved in some sort of Chinese support of its police, Papua New Guinea, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=549.84s)]
*  and on and on. And so there's a security overtone. And I think one set of speculation [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=555.92s)]
*  involving the meeting in Japan is, will there be some sort of announcement on security agreement [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=561.12s)]
*  or security and even defense cooperation agreement? That might be too sweeping. I think these Pacific [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=566.64s)]
*  Island nations, while happy to be invited to this forum and happy to have the aid that's forthcoming, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=571.04s)]
*  they're playing their cards pretty carefully too. I think they have among other interests, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=577.92s)]
*  they have existential interests. And so while the competition with China is out there, they're also [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=583.04s)]
*  going to be keenly looking for help in terms of the climate change issue, which is an existential [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=589.04s)]
*  one for them front and center. These are countries that are watching eerily as the water levels rise. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=595.12s)]
*  And these are, in some cases, these countries are constituted of hundreds, if not thousands, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=600.8s)]
*  of islands and so forth. So they're going to be looking at the climate change issue. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  They're going to be looking at this issue, particularly involving Japan, of whether they [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  come to some sort of agreement on Japan releasing more than a million tons of treated water from its [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=614.72s)]
*  Fukushima nuclear plant over a number of years. So some of these islands have memories of nuclear [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=620.0s)]
*  testing that took place over many years in the post-war period, post-World War II period. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=626.48s)]
*  They are not going to blithely look at tainted water being distributed their way. So I think [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=630.88s)]
*  that's an issue of potentially some impasse. But in general, it's going to be Japan saying, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=636.88s)]
*  look, we have ways of helping you. We have development aid. We have ways of being a [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=642.0s)]
*  partner and not just a sort of a overbearing big brother like they were portraying China. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=646.32s)]
*  And China has had in its Belt and Road Initiative this reputation of sort of this debt diplomacy [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=651.68s)]
*  reputation and building infrastructure and then sort of weighing heavily on these countries that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=656.08s)]
*  can't pay up and having leverage and so forth. So it's all to say, Carla, there is a big [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=661.04s)]
*  competition playing out. And Japan is going to be showing what it can offer these countries while [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=666.08s)]
*  also trying to retain a sense of free and open navigation as well as the open exchange of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=671.12s)]
*  resources which Japan keenly relies on some of these countries. So can we go back to China and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=677.92s)]
*  this police force is training them? Of course, Japan has its history of occupation, but given [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=683.68s)]
*  China's, the Chinese known for their great respect for civil liberties and personal privacy, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=690.8s)]
*  why would a country invite the Chinese in to train a police force? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=698.88s)]
*  That is a very good question. I think there are other issues at play here, but China is coming in [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  and basically saying many respectful things about the sovereignty and the integrity of these [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=710.08s)]
*  countries and that it has a role to play in offering assistance, in offering, let's say, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=714.88s)]
*  it could be some infrastructure assistance for policing programs. Keep in mind, again, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  these are countries that are, some of them are extremely poor, extremely under equipped, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=724.0s)]
*  and they are glad to have whatever aid they can get in terms of basic governance. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=728.8s)]
*  Isn't that something that the United States or the Japanese or the Australians could easily, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=733.2s)]
*  easily compete on? All you have to do is go out there and look at the Freedom House ratings or [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=738.16s)]
*  any other rating system and say, who would you rather, not that we have a perfect, okay, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=744.16s)]
*  we won't have the American police forces do it, but certainly the Japanese out there with their [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=749.68s)]
*  gloves and their, you know, why would you want the Chinese to come in and do this? Isn't this [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=753.84s)]
*  something we could easily compete on? Well, I think that's certainly the message [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=758.88s)]
*  that's coming from countries like Australia. Again, Australia can come in and offer help. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=762.4s)]
*  The United States is also, especially when it saw the agreement taking place in the Solomon Islands, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=766.0s)]
*  it stepped up and it started to propose its own offers, I think, to Papua New Guinea, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=770.8s)]
*  among other places. So yes, you're absolutely right. They should. The fact that it's still [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=775.28s)]
*  a competition rather than a walkover for the countries that support democracy and rule of law [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  should give you pause about what other baggage might be involved with these other countries. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  So I think it's a question of providing the right package of agreements, not to be sort of [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=791.76s)]
*  overwhelming in their support, but come with the right sort of bundle of things, Carla. And I think [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=796.56s)]
*  to your point, China has been handling its diplomacy fairly deftly, but there is a [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=802.24s)]
*  counterpoint. And I think what's going to come up at this meeting in Tokyo is going to be Japan's [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=807.6s)]
*  offer. Japan has had its own kind of tough history, obviously World War II era being one episode, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=812.96s)]
*  but also in resource extraction, in overfishing, it wasn't just Chinese fishing fleets, but Japanese [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=820.96s)]
*  fishing fleets that would roam into these waters and heavily fish areas. I think some of these [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=826.4s)]
*  countries have done a great deal to wall off and create exclusion zones for their fisheries, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=831.2s)]
*  which are really important as you look at the pace of overfishing going on in the world. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=837.36s)]
*  I just cite that as one sphere in which countries are competing and countries have legacy to deal [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=841.2s)]
*  with as they try to present a more positive face and to try to bring these Pacific Island nations [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=847.44s)]
*  into their orbit. Again, this meeting in Japan is an important forum for these countries to come [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=851.76s)]
*  together. Let's say Japan, Australia, and New Zealand can provide particular resources to the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  small Tuvalu's and Vanuatu and so forth. And we'll see what happens. As I say, it is a great race [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=864.08s)]
*  type of image that's emerging from this area and China is in it for keeps. And I think you're [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=871.68s)]
*  starting to see Australia, certainly in Japan really step up. Okay, Carla, let's take it all [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=878.08s)]
*  back to Paris, shall we? We'll always have Paris after all. And previously when we were in Paris [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=882.96s)]
*  on this podcast, we deliberated if the French snap parliamentary elections could actually alter [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=889.28s)]
*  the France's political landscape in a rightward direction in particular. So changes occurred in [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=895.12s)]
*  the runoff, but not in the way most expected. During the second round of voting, the National [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=899.92s)]
*  Popular Front, which is a coalition of leftist and environmentalist parties, took the lead. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=903.92s)]
*  Macron's Together movement came in second and Marine Le Pen's national rally came in third [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=909.36s)]
*  in terms of the number of seats. National rally actually had the highest percentage of votes at [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=915.36s)]
*  37%. But because of an electoral maneuver, this coalition of leftists was able to come ahead. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  So could you talk a little bit about this process, what's going on in France and whether [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=926.4s)]
*  this coalition is going to be able to govern and pull together some sort of a coalition? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=931.2s)]
*  Macron, this was the snap elections. He didn't consult with anybody, but this was, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=935.28s)]
*  we talked about this, was this big gamble after the EU parliamentary elections in which the right [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=939.9200000000001s)]
*  did so well in France and in Germany and other places. Macron said, okay, you guys, you got it [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=945.2s)]
*  out of your system, let's pull it together here and I'm going to give you a real choice. And [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=952.72s)]
*  all the polls suggested that this was really a big mistake on his part. And when the first round [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=958.8000000000001s)]
*  came around, it showed it was a really big mistake because lots of people turned out to vote for the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  right. And then people woke up in France and it did not turn out as disastrously as the polls [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=969.04s)]
*  predicted in the second round. And that is because of the rare willingness of politicians [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=976.0s)]
*  in France to set aside their egos. And in the second round vote in three-way races, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=981.04s)]
*  the weaker candidates, either from the left or centrist parties dropped out to avoid splitting [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=986.7199999999999s)]
*  the anti-right vote. And they ended up blocking the right-wing candidates in lots of these different [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=991.36s)]
*  races. And you don't really see self-abnegating politicians very often in any country. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=996.96s)]
*  And we've seen this strategy before in France, it's called the Republican front, but it worked. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1002.32s)]
*  That's good right now. There will not be a far-right government in France this time around, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  but let's not forget that Le Pen's far-right party still increased its number of seats in the lower [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1012.4000000000001s)]
*  house from 89 in 2022 to 143. So it is not time to let down our guard. That's a quarter of all seats, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1017.12s)]
*  so it's significant. Yes. The left-wing coalition came in first and Macron's ensemble, as you said, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1025.36s)]
*  came in second. But what those numbers mean also is that no party has the 289 seat majority. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  And the big question now is whether Macron, and under the constitution it's the president who [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1039.6s)]
*  is supposed to do this, can put together and keep together a government that can actually run the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1044.0s)]
*  country. You know, coalition governments are common in parliamentary systems in Europe and [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1049.6799999999998s)]
*  in lots of other places, and they're not necessarily the most stable ways to govern. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1054.72s)]
*  And Politico noted it took Germany more than 10 weeks and a 166-page document to negotiate its [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1059.68s)]
*  current government, and it took the Belgians almost two years to put together a coalition [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  government with seven parties. But the French don't have a history of governing by coalitions, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1069.44s)]
*  and in fact, Macron's government up until this election was a minority government, no coalition [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1074.72s)]
*  there. But it looks like now the coalition is what Macron wants, and he sent a letter to the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1080.72s)]
*  French people, which was published today, Thursday, in regional papers, and he said [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1085.92s)]
*  it would take a little time to build what he called a broad gathering of, quote, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1090.16s)]
*  Republican forces to form a coalition government. He also said that no one won the snap elections. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1094.72s)]
*  Now, the left-wing coalition is incensed about this, and they say they have the largest number [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1100.4s)]
*  of seats, which means that they should have the right to choose the next prime minister. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1104.96s)]
*  And they say they'll name one soon. But so far there's really no sign that this coalition can [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1108.72s)]
*  even agree on a candidate. Keep in mind this isn't a party. This is a coalition of parties, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1114.64s)]
*  and they didn't even exist before these snap elections. They pulled together solely for this [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1118.88s)]
*  vote. They go all the way from socialists and greens and this far-left party itself that's, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1123.28s)]
*  you know, France Unbowed, led by a guy you don't see a single story that describes us, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1130.48s)]
*  it doesn't describe us as a firebrand. This guy Jean-Luc Melenchon. You know, I can't imagine how [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1134.64s)]
*  this coalition is going to hold together. I can't imagine how they're going to come up with a [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1140.5600000000002s)]
*  candidate that they can agree on. They do share some policy positions, but there's no leader. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1143.76s)]
*  And so we will see. Macron seems to want to strip away the more moderate members of the left [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1148.8000000000002s)]
*  coalition and begin a dialogue. But for him to put together a government that could actually work, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1156.0s)]
*  a coalition that actually work, he's going to have to give up a lot of policies that are [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1161.12s)]
*  near and dear to him. I mean, one thing that this left coalition all agrees on is they want to do [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1164.72s)]
*  away with his pension reform. They want to lower the retirement age again. They want to increase [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1169.28s)]
*  the minimum wage. They want to freeze the prices of essential goods, food, energy, and gas. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1174.56s)]
*  And this really, really goes against everything Macron believes in. And it also goes against what [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  the EU wants. France is already in big trouble for deficit spending. So we'll see. And final point is [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1185.68s)]
*  that one thing that everybody pretty much in France seems to agree on, nobody likes Macron. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1192.0800000000002s)]
*  And he's going to be around at least another three years, barring any other dramatic events in France. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1198.24s)]
*  But I am struck, Carla, by this sense of hooray, we held off the right surge, but oh my God, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1203.04s)]
*  we can't govern. Because the images are showing people out in the streets waving French flags, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  the sense of relief and unity and so forth. And yet behind it all is a governance problem. And [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1214.32s)]
*  we've seen our share during the Macron years and before that of French protests, really, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1221.4399999999998s)]
*  really stirring ones. The Gilets Jaunes movement wasn't too long ago, for example. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1226.1599999999999s)]
*  And a lot of these were in response to some of these policies you mentioned, Carla. So [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1230.3999999999999s)]
*  for him to go back into that and dive into that seems very difficult, even though he does as [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1234.3999999999999s)]
*  president possess a lot of powers, right? I mean, he still has the ability to conduct foreign and [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1240.32s)]
*  defense policy with a good amount of authority. And he has some constitutional powers to override [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1244.56s)]
*  parliament. Is that right? He does. And that's how he did the pension reform, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1250.6399999999999s)]
*  is that he jammed it down their throat. He did it without a vote in the lower house. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1254.08s)]
*  But then people were out in the street. Some people are already saying that the far left of [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1257.76s)]
*  this coalition, which has the largest number of seats in the coalition that won, saying that [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1262.24s)]
*  they're going to go back into the street if they don't get their candidate in as prime minister. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1267.84s)]
*  So we'll see. We could see people back in the street over that. I think Macron's strategy is [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1271.36s)]
*  he wants to strip away the socialists. He wants to strip away the greens, what he calls Republican [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1275.76s)]
*  forces, and try to get some sort of coalition government, which will build on what you're [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1280.9599999999998s)]
*  saying, this relief that they don't have the extreme right and what he considers the extreme [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1285.9199999999998s)]
*  and anti-Semitic left in the coalition as well. And Melanchon has certainly made anti-Semitic [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1292.32s)]
*  comments. And so we'll see whether he can pull it off. If people liked him more, it might be easier. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1297.12s)]
*  And he's not a guy who's known for compromising. And he is going to have to compromise on some [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1303.04s)]
*  really fundamental domestic issues. And he's caught also between his ego and his fundamental [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1307.36s)]
*  fiscal beliefs. And he's also got a lot of pressure from the EU, as I said. Deficit spending, the EU [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1315.04s)]
*  says that they're supposed to keep the deficit below 3%. They're at 5%. And all the things that [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1320.3999999999999s)]
*  the parties he wants to strip away from the NPF want would require a lot more deficit spending. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1326.08s)]
*  We'll see. Is France ungovernable? Let's hope not, because we certainly need France as an ally for [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1332.08s)]
*  Ukraine and for a stable Europe. So... Second biggest EU economy. Yep. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1337.84s)]
*  We will see. Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1342.56s)]
*  This is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's Instagram [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1348.6399999999999s)]
*  story. This week, Bob, our audience selected reformist Peseshkin is Iran's president-elect. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1354.32s)]
*  A rare bit of good news. The results of Iran's elections were a true surprise. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1362.08s)]
*  Why did the religious elite let him win? And is there any hope he can make any change in Iran? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1366.8799999999999s)]
*  Short answer, probably not. No. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1372.56s)]
*  But hope springs eternal. And it's interesting how often it springs up when Iran elects a, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1376.72s)]
*  take your pick, reformist, moderate, pragmatist. That was a term we heard under the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1382.8799999999999s)]
*  Rouhani administration not too long ago. These are people who can nudge around the edges, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1387.52s)]
*  but the power structures such as they are in Iran, and again, most power emanates from the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1392.8s)]
*  Supreme Leader, are hard line. And those power structures did permit Peseshkin to run. And it [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1396.8s)]
*  was an intentional move. They weeded out a lot of other people and people who were so-called moderates [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1402.3999999999999s)]
*  who were a lot more conservative than Peseshkin. But I think this is a concern. This is something [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1407.12s)]
*  our colleague Reitake has written about and talked about a lot, which is the regime values [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1412.16s)]
*  the legitimacy that these elections bring. And the turnout was getting really jarringly low. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1416.8000000000002s)]
*  The first round of these elections was like 40%. Peseshkin emerged as one of the three candidates [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1422.96s)]
*  remaining and it shot up to about close to 50% turnout for the runoff. And Peseshkin is saying [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1428.24s)]
*  many of the right things. He's not out there calling for radical changes, but he is saying [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1435.2s)]
*  that the hijab law is too restrictive. Now let's see what kind of leeway he has in really loosening [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1441.2s)]
*  up the enforcement of that. But he has been saying that that was a campaign issue. He's talking [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1447.0400000000002s)]
*  about in positive ways writ large, the Iran nuclear deal, which when it was in effect for the brief [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
*  period, eased up sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran allowing controls on its nuclear enrichment [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1456.72s)]
*  program, which it continues to profess is for civilian purposes only. So will he bring back [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1462.64s)]
*  the former foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who was the foreign minister who negotiated that deal? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1469.2s)]
*  Will he come back as foreign minister? Possibly. He was certainly out there campaigning very [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  strongly and they're not basically saying, by the way, that Iran's going to yield all sorts [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1479.2s)]
*  of concessions to get back into the nuclear deal. They're still going to expect what the [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1484.96s)]
*  Raisi government expect, the Ibrahim Raisi government, which was that the US would come [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1487.92s)]
*  back into compliance with the deal. That's going to be really hard to do without some sort of [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1492.48s)]
*  gestures from Iran. So it's a difficult road. He certainly cuts a different figure from Ibrahim [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1496.16s)]
*  Raisi. Raisi, again, as a reminder, was killed in a helicopter crash. He was more front and center [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1501.0400000000002s)]
*  of the regime. He was even rumored to be someone in the running for succeeding the supreme leader, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1506.72s)]
*  who by the way is about 85 years old. And Pesachian is not that. He is not part of the [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1511.1200000000001s)]
*  hardline judiciary, for example, that Raisi was. He's a heart surgeon. He was a health minister [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1518.72s)]
*  previously. Again, he's someone who is a somewhat even bland figure. He's an ethnic Azare and Kurd, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1524.24s)]
*  who got a lot of support from those constituencies, of which there are many, by the way, in Iran. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1531.84s)]
*  So he comes from a different part of society, again, seen as non-threatening, and he was allowed [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1536.56s)]
*  and it was a very tough gatekeeping process that allowed him to run. So I think he's seen as [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1542.08s)]
*  controllable. We might see some changes by degree. It's not like Iran's going to rein in its axis of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1546.48s)]
*  resistance or suddenly turn over a new leaf. So the things I've read suggest that he will have [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1552.0s)]
*  next to no control over international issues, other than suggesting that he wants to resume [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1560.16s)]
*  discussions over reviving the Iran nuclear deal, which actually is supposed to run out right now. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1566.8s)]
*  But I don't know how you start the clock since it's been in advance for such a long period of time. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1571.52s)]
*  And let's face it, this deal was supposed to put off Iran's breakout ability, its ability to have [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1577.04s)]
*  enough fuel to produce a bomb within a year. And now betting is it's got enough fuel to produce [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1583.2s)]
*  three or four weapons within days or weeks. So how you roll that back, the goal obviously would be [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1589.04s)]
*  to get Iran to ferry stuff out. That's a big step. There's a lot there. And then of course, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1594.3999999999999s)]
*  what hangs over this is the possibility of Trump's reelection. So there's a lot of wishing and hoping [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1599.28s)]
*  and we will see about that. But he's not going to have, as you said, a lot of control over the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1604.88s)]
*  axis of resistance. But he also has been quoted as talking about how Iran is in too tight with the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1609.2s)]
*  Russians and that it's lost a lot of its autonomy with the Russians. Iran has been supplying [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1615.1200000000001s)]
*  drones to the Russians, played a pretty fundamental role in Russia's ability to deploy [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1620.96s)]
*  drones in Ukraine itself. I mean, he says a lot of the right things and it's remarkable that they let [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1626.3200000000002s)]
*  him even run saying a lot of the right things. And his position on the hijab, from my understanding, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1631.2s)]
*  has been that women should have a choice on the hijab. That's a pretty radical position to take. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1637.2s)]
*  So I keep coming back to why did they let him run? Maybe it just comes down to they thought they [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1642.16s)]
*  could control him. Yeah, I really think that seems to be the case, Carla. They feel like he's not [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1648.0s)]
*  someone who commands a strong constituency on his own, not hugely charismatic per se, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1653.04s)]
*  and has said all the right things, even while saying these other things, has said all the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1658.5600000000002s)]
*  right things about supporting the Supreme Leader and doubling down on Iran's form of governance [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1661.6000000000001s)]
*  and so forth. I think one of the other things that Iran watchers are going to be checking out soon [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1668.3200000000002s)]
*  in the weeks ahead as he's inaugurated is who he picks for his cabinet. Will he pick a woman? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1673.6000000000001s)]
*  Will there be a woman who's outspoken on issues like the hijab, for example? Will there be other [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1677.3600000000001s)]
*  non-traditional people who are part of this cabinet in terms of coming from ethnic minorities? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1682.64s)]
*  Even it's been mentioned possibly a Sunni Muslim could be part of the cabinet. That would be a [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1687.92s)]
*  very interesting sign because again, those types of things usually one expects they would have the [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1692.3200000000002s)]
*  blessing of the Supreme Leader. But I think this election was about getting more people out to vote [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1697.3600000000001s)]
*  and people are angry about the state of the economy, this Iran in a box syndrome, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1703.52s)]
*  and the deep, deep corruption that pervades some of the senior figures. I think they see [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1709.52s)]
*  possession as somebody who's at least worth a try and just comes from a different background [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1714.88s)]
*  and might hold some keys to some path out of this because Saeed Jalili, an arch hardliner [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1720.4s)]
*  who was his main opponent, was about doubling down on making common cause with Russia and China, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1726.48s)]
*  stood up to the West and very much against any sort of reopening the nuclear deal and so forth. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1732.16s)]
*  So I do think it's a situation where the regime feels like it can inch ahead. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1738.24s)]
*  What's also going to be fascinating though is this issue of a succession to the Supreme Leader. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1743.44s)]
*  He's very old. He has been said to be ailing for a while. And what is that process going to be like [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1748.72s)]
*  and how much is that going to affect the country's moving forward? Because Supreme Leader, as the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1755.1200000000001s)]
*  name says, could be someone who comes in and issues a fatwa about the nuclear program, for example, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1760.48s)]
*  and that could change the whole situation. So much to watch on the Iran front this summer, Carla. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1766.0s)]
*  Well, I still, being hopeful about Iran is probably a losing game, but the fact that they [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1771.68s)]
*  let him run, the fact that they let him win is either cynically because they thought they [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1777.2s)]
*  could control him, but also perhaps because they're a little bit afraid of their own people [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1782.72s)]
*  and the potential for protests in the street. Stealing this election overtly from him [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1788.88s)]
*  would potentially have had a pretty bad backlash. So if he were a savvy political player, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1793.92s)]
*  maybe he could build a constituency, but that's probably naive, but I want to believe that. So [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1799.2s)]
*  let's hope. Well, we'll come back to this many times, I'm sure, Carla. And that's our look at [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG-QpD-SA&t=1805.1200000000001s)]
