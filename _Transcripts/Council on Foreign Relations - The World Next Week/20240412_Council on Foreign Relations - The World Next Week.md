# Congress’s Urgent Agenda, Sudan’s Year of War, Ecuador-Mexico Embassy Fray, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs)
*  In the coming week, Congress returns to feuds over surveillance law and Ukraine, and Sudan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=0.0s)]
*  begins a second year of civil war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=6.4s)]
*  It's April 11, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=8.68s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=12.68s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=14.8s)]
*  Carla, we're going to start off on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=17.8s)]
*  And this is because we've already had a congressional return that has been mired in internal feuding, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=29.64s)]
*  grappling over a couple of, in particular, very big agenda items. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=35.6s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson is seeking a path for reauthorizing Section 702 of what is known [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=39.28s)]
*  as FISA, or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=44.24s)]
*  But he's running into really some exceptional opposition from his own caucus. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  19 Republican lawmakers defied the GOP leadership and voted with Democrats to defeat a procedural [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  vote that would have advanced reauthorization for the spy legislation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=57.64s)]
*  So Carla Johnson is trying to bring up FISA to the floor, it seems like, at last report. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=62.36s)]
*  But with this kind of pushback, what does this mean for this national security priority? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=67.76s)]
*  So Bob, as you said, Congress is back in town and the dysfunction is back with them in full [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=72.16s)]
*  force. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=78.12s)]
*  And right now, some of the biggest issues roiling the Republican ranks, and by the middle [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=79.72s)]
*  of the month, they're only going to have a majority of one. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=83.6s)]
*  Some of their biggest problems are in the national security world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=87.36s)]
*  Yesterday, after President Trump posted on Truth Social, kill FISA, it was illegally [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=89.88s)]
*  used against me, Speaker Johnson's third effort, count them three, to advance a five-year [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=94.8s)]
*  extension of Section 702, collapsed in an all-out brawl. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=100.28s)]
*  And this section of FISA allows the government to collect electronic communications, we're [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=105.24s)]
*  talking about phone calls, emails, text messages, from foreigners abroad without a warrant, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=110.16s)]
*  even when those non-citizens are communicating with Americans in the U.S. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=115.96s)]
*  It should also be noted that the so-called spying Mr. Trump is referring to concerned [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=119.8s)]
*  a different section of FISA, which is used for targeting Americans on U.S. soil, when [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=123.55999999999999s)]
*  the FBI did get a wiretap to listen in on a former Trump campaign aide as part of the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=128.44s)]
*  Russia investigation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=132.6s)]
*  But never mind, he did call for killing it, and the next thing you know, 19 MAGA Republicans [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=134.16s)]
*  killed it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=140.88s)]
*  So why is 702 so controversial for both the right and the left? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  It is a bipartisan objection. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  While there are supposed to be limits on how American communications swept up in investigations [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=148.28s)]
*  can be used, those limits have been repeatedly broken by the FBI, including as part of investigations [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=152.28s)]
*  into the January 6 riots and the Black Lives Matter protests. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=157.72s)]
*  And when the FBI was caught out, they have supposedly cleaned up their act, and the Bill [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=161.96s)]
*  Johnson has been backing would write those reforms into law, requiring more transparency [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  on how communications are used, and limit the number of U.S. officials with access to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  that pool of information. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=176.36s)]
*  But the left and the right isn't happy, and both House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=178.28s)]
*  ranking member Jerry Nadler, and that's a really strange pairing, support a measure [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  which would require law enforcement to get a warrant before querying the repository for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  the contents of Americans' communications. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=191.88s)]
*  National security officials have been up lobbying like mad on the hill for the 702 extensions. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  They say that warrant requirement would either deny them access to critical intelligence [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=199.8s)]
*  or slow the process down so much that it would make it almost useless for terrorism, human [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=203.28s)]
*  trafficking or whatever it is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=207.8s)]
*  So Section 702 is supposed to expire on April 19th. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=210.36s)]
*  FISA has its own court, and that ruled last week that they could continue for another [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=214.08s)]
*  year even with the expiring because there are active cases. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=217.84s)]
*  But remarkably, even after Wednesday's defeat, a Trump-caused defeat, Johnson vowed that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  he's going to regroup and move forward. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  This is a man who likes pain. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=229.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=230.8s)]
*  Well, it's quite a scenario you've sketched out, Carla, and it does make me wonder how [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=231.8s)]
*  many other issues like this, and we're going to talk about one of them relatively soon, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=237.4s)]
*  but it makes me wonder how many issues are going to be affected in the spy realm. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=241.4s)]
*  You mentioned terrorism as just one, as many other things going on right now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  The world is a perilous place. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  Do we have a sense whether there's any sort of immediate national security concerns or [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=251.68s)]
*  it's just like the precedent of what's happening is particularly raising alarm? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=255.36s)]
*  Well, do I believe that the sky's going to fall if this 702 isn't extended? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=260.12s)]
*  I'm somewhat skeptical to be perfectly frank. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=266.64s)]
*  When 702 was put in in the first place, it was supposed to make up for the wireless wiretapping [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=270.0s)]
*  of the George W. Bush administration, and we've been scrambling since 9-11 to make up [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=274.76s)]
*  a lot of the abuses of that time period. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=280.92s)]
*  So what the right balance is, I don't know. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=284.16s)]
*  What I do know is that when President Trump snaps his fingers and it cuts off any reasonable [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=286.92s)]
*  debate on something, that's concerning as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=293.5s)]
*  And he makes it so personal in such a way, he tends to galvanize a certain part of his [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=296.6s)]
*  base. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=300.56s)]
*  So yeah, it's going to be, as with many other things, it's going to be very interesting [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=301.56s)]
*  to see how Speaker Johnson is able to navigate this moment. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=304.68s)]
*  Carla, I wanted to move on to another extremely momentous issue, which is aid to Ukraine. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  Speaker Johnson has faced threats from members of his own party to remove him if he moves [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=313.24s)]
*  on the aid package that is before him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  There have been daily reminders of what's at stake for Ukraine, which just weathered [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  another set of aerial assaults overnight. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  So should we expect any action from Congress on Ukraine? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=326.68s)]
*  Well, the situation there is really dire. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  General Christopher Cavoli, who's the head of the US European Command, testified before [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=333.2s)]
*  the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday yesterday. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=337.08s)]
*  And he said that without more US military support for Ukraine, within weeks Russia would [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=341.08s)]
*  hold a 10 to 1 advantage on artillery shells. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  And he said something we all know, the side that can't shoot back loses. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=349.28s)]
*  And Johnson has refused to take up the Senate pass supplemental bill, which is $95.3 billion, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=353.68s)]
*  which includes $60 billion for Ukraine. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=359.84s)]
*  But he's also said repeatedly that he's going to introduce an alternative version, though [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=362.76s)]
*  it's still not clear what that would look like. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=366.84s)]
*  There's no doubt that if he got a clean bill passed the Rules Committee, and that's the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=370.32s)]
*  committee in the House that decides whether legislation can come to a vote and other procedural [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=374.2s)]
*  issues, there's no doubt if he got it through, the money for Ukraine would be approved easily [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=378.96s)]
*  with Democratic votes and a good number of Republicans. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=383.6s)]
*  The question is what the speaker is going to attach to it to try to get it through, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  or whether they're going to come up with some other game to bypass the Rules Committee. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=391.48s)]
*  He's been trying to mollify his caucus on this one and the ideas that Johnson has floated [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=396.4s)]
*  so far, something called the Repo Act to use seized Russian assets to pay for the aid or [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=400.35999999999996s)]
*  making the money alone rather than a grant, or overturning Biden's ban on new applications [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  to export liquefied natural gas. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=410.26s)]
*  None of these ideas are ringing any major bells with the conservatives in his caucus [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=412.4s)]
*  and certainly not with President Trump. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  And what conservatives are demanding, notably draconian border security provisions, have [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=419.52s)]
*  no possibility of garnering Democratic votes that are going to be needed to pass the House [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=423.92s)]
*  or get through the Senate. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=427.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Johnson's number one nemesis, Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia, is pushing [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=429.68s)]
*  for Johnson's ouster, particularly over Ukraine. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  And what is Johnson doing? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=438.08s)]
*  He's on his way to Mar-a-Lago on Friday for what is being billed as a major announcement [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=439.52s)]
*  on election integrity. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=443.64s)]
*  Whether that's going to be enough to take the heat off of Johnson and to quiet MTG, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=445.64s)]
*  we will see, or whether he's going to have to give on FISA or Ukraine, I don't know. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=450.24s)]
*  So the plot thickens. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=456.92s)]
*  On the Ukraine issue and former President Trump, he had came out relatively recently [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=458.68s)]
*  with what looked to be an updated plan for a peace there, which would involve acknowledging [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=462.8s)]
*  Russian gains in terms of the annexation of Crimea and the Donetsk, roughly a chunk, almost [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=468.64s)]
*  20% of Ukrainian territory, I believe, was counted in that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=473.44s)]
*  Is that some way of indicating that Trump is trying to articulate his vision for Ukraine? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=477.24s)]
*  And is that some sort of a through line to this debate at all, or is it just something [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  else to consider in the background as this urgent aid package continues to kind of sit [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=485.90000000000003s)]
*  in the House? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=491.24s)]
*  I don't see this as a sort of a serious peace plan. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=493.0s)]
*  And it seems to me to be appeasement. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=496.88s)]
*  At some point, if the Ukrainians don't get aid, they will lose. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=499.04s)]
*  And they're not going to stop fighting, of course. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=504.44s)]
*  But it looks like they've got the 600 mile front. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=506.76s)]
*  Russians are expected to mount a major offensive this summer. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  Ukrainians are building bunkers and trenches. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=513.92s)]
*  But the Russians have this enormous, enormous advantage in artillery. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=515.68s)]
*  And if we don't get this aid to them, I suppose, at some point, they may be forced into some [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=519.46s)]
*  sort of a peace plan. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=525.2s)]
*  But I don't see this as an elaborated Trump plan for this. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=526.68s)]
*  And even Lindsey Graham has been reportedly very unhappy with the Trump proposal. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=532.68s)]
*  So I'm not taking this very seriously right now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  And certainly Zelensky is not taking it very seriously. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=542.4799999999999s)]
*  I think what everyone's taking very seriously is the fact of what General Kivoli said, which [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=545.0s)]
*  is if we don't get the aid to the Ukrainians, they're going to lose. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=549.8s)]
*  And even if that's a long path to losing, it's grinding, it's destructive. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  Again, we're seeing every day what seems to be a ratcheting up of Russian attacks on civilian [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=559.76s)]
*  targets, on infrastructure targets and so forth. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=564.04s)]
*  And it's more and more looking dire for Ukraine. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=567.28s)]
*  We're seeing NATO try to come up with creative ways of maybe funding some sort of help. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  But there's a long path for them to have the capability to both fund increased aid as well [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=574.62s)]
*  as actually create new armaments, materials, defense mechanisms and so forth. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  So we've had the Ukrainian foreign minister, I believe, most recently coming in very blunt [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=585.16s)]
*  terms asking for older patriot systems to try to help defend Ukraine. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=589.12s)]
*  It's getting hotter and hotter, Karla. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=593.4s)]
*  And the Czech government has rallied 20 countries to have this common fund for purchasing artillery [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=595.6s)]
*  shells on the global market. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=602.48s)]
*  The Ukrainians themselves have lowered the conscription age. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=605.04s)]
*  Everybody's trying to pull together to try to figure out anything they can possibly do [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  to push back against the Russians. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=612.52s)]
*  But when you think a year ago, what we were talking about, we were talking about a Ukrainian [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=614.1s)]
*  offensive. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=617.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=618.5s)]
*  And now what everyone's talking about is a Russian offensive. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=619.5s)]
*  The Russians clearly have the upper hand at this point. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=621.7s)]
*  And the Ukrainians need the support even just to hold the line. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=624.94s)]
*  So Bob, let's talk about Sudan, another very grim tale. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=630.94s)]
*  Next Monday, April 15th marks one year since the start of the fighting between Chief Abdel [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=636.26s)]
*  Fatah al-Borhan's Sudanese Armed Forces and Mohammed Hamdan Daghelo's paramilitary [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=641.06s)]
*  rapid support forces. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=647.3599999999999s)]
*  Since then, tens of thousands of people have been killed, eight million people are displaced, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=649.9799999999999s)]
*  and both the army and the RSF are blocking the delivery of desperately needed aid. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=653.7399999999999s)]
*  They seem determined to starve each other out, and what they're doing is starving their [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=657.78s)]
*  own people. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=661.3399999999999s)]
*  The World Food Program reports that 18 million people in Sudan face acute food insecurity, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=662.7199999999999s)]
*  or what the UN is describing, catastrophic hunger. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=667.86s)]
*  Is there any way out of this? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=670.62s)]
*  It is looking more and more grim, Carla, and that is a really difficult question and disturbingly [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=673.42s)]
*  difficult question to answer. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=678.2s)]
*  And it's worth noting that even with the numbers that you just cited, the scale of them, in [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=680.1s)]
*  addition to those displaced, by the way, there's a million and a half people who have actually [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=684.1s)]
*  left the country who are in pretty desperate refugee camps in places like Chad. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=686.94s)]
*  Even with those high numbers and clear signs of famine spreading, they are struggling. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=692.44s)]
*  People who work in Sudan areas are struggling to get attention because of everything else [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=697.14s)]
*  going on, in particular, the plight of Palestinians in Gaza and the ongoing Israel Hamas war, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=701.62s)]
*  for example. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=707.86s)]
*  There's the Ukraine issue that we just mentioned, and there are many other areas that are occupying [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=709.1s)]
*  the inboxes of governments that can make a difference, especially the US and Western [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=714.26s)]
*  capitals, which could bring some pressure to bear. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=719.5s)]
*  One of the big issues that's being seized on now, Carla, is can those who are clearly [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=722.14s)]
*  lining up on different sides of this, behind the two commanders you just mentioned, can [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=728.14s)]
*  those parties play any sort of a role? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=732.22s)]
*  Can they be pressed themselves to play a role that helps bring this to an end? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=735.14s)]
*  Let's cite one of them, UAE. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=739.42s)]
*  It's a big supporter of the RSF, the Rapid Support Forces, and their leader known as [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=740.78s)]
*  Hamedi. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=744.3s)]
*  And those Rapid Support Forces, almost like a client force at this point, they control [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=745.5s)]
*  gold supplies, among other things. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=749.98s)]
*  They control certain very valuable assets in the country. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=751.62s)]
*  Al-Burhan also is in control of certain valuable assets, and he's backed by Egypt and seemingly [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=755.7s)]
*  nominally by the Saudis, although the Saudis are trying to play a peace broker role still [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=761.7s)]
*  with the United States. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=766.02s)]
*  The United States is going to push for, first of all, more aid funding at a donor conference [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=767.5s)]
*  in Paris on April 15. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=772.46s)]
*  But then how does the aid get in there in a way that's not weaponized and not controlled [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=774.1s)]
*  by either side? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=777.74s)]
*  They're both showing their willingness and ability to loot and to commoditize any aid [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=779.3s)]
*  that comes into the country, whether it's parts of Khartoum, the capital that they hold, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=783.5s)]
*  the different sides hold, or elsewhere. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  And so they're becoming more and more dug in and they're relying on their outside aid [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=790.66s)]
*  to help them. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=794.5s)]
*  So can the US make a role? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=795.6s)]
*  There's a US envoy named Tom Perillo who's trying to make a difference now. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=797.22s)]
*  He's pushing for peace talks. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=801.9s)]
*  I guess they're going to resume again on April 18 in Jeddah. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=803.98s)]
*  They're trying to rally the sides to come up with, first of all, a verifiable clear [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=808.1s)]
*  ceasefire to just stop once and for all the fighting, which is causing such disproportionate [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=813.7s)]
*  damage to civilian infrastructure, to certainly civilians, as well as rampant war crimes that [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=819.1800000000001s)]
*  are being reported, and unfortunately in places like Darfur, which was not too long ago victimized [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  by genocide by the forces similar to those that are supporting Hamati right now. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=830.82s)]
*  So it is on so many levels, it's humanitarian, it's human rights, it's just political, it's [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=835.86s)]
*  just a regional stability. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=841.02s)]
*  There's a lot at stake here, Karla. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=842.62s)]
*  And we're going to see by the end of this month whether, first of all, the US has enough [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=844.58s)]
*  leverage to sort of bring about a change in the approach to this and whether it can do [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=849.88s)]
*  that through regional efforts, maybe filtering into the UN at some point. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=854.42s)]
*  Otherwise we're looking at Sudan becoming just another one of these inflection points [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=858.9s)]
*  and rival for the worst humanitarian situation in the world by far. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=863.82s)]
*  Peace talks implies that there are things to be bargained over. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=867.94s)]
*  It seems to me like this is just a naked fight for territory and power. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=874.22s)]
*  Do we know what they're negotiating? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=879.86s)]
*  You're right. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=882.9000000000001s)]
*  And it is about maintaining territory and power. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=883.9000000000001s)]
*  These are two commanders who have gained a bit of parity from what we've seen over a [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=886.4200000000001s)]
*  year of fighting that each has a different set of strengths that they can deploy. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=891.94s)]
*  And so which one is willing to give in and which one is willing to compromise? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=896.94s)]
*  In the past, we've seen that happen when one side gets the upper hand and the other side [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=902.82s)]
*  is willing to sue for peace. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=906.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't know actually from what I've seen what they are willing to, like what's on the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=907.58s)]
*  table for them in terms of a lasting solution. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=912.38s)]
*  All I know is that there's a ceasefire effort that involves a bit of sticks and carrots [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=915.82s)]
*  in terms of the US can bring to bear some sanctioning of some of the leaders of either [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=920.22s)]
*  side. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=925.86s)]
*  For example, it can also press the governments that are aiding them like the UAE. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=926.86s)]
*  But I haven't seen anything that shows that the US is willing to really step up and press [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=931.14s)]
*  leadership of the UAE or Egypt for that matter, which supports the government run forces in [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=936.0600000000001s)]
*  Sudan. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=941.14s)]
*  So it's really about, as I said, the ceasefire. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=942.14s)]
*  It's about maybe can there be some agreed upon access points into Sudan for humanitarian [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=944.46s)]
*  aid that are then protected in which both sides are observing basic norms and providing [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=949.74s)]
*  aid to people who are at risk of famine. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=955.3399999999999s)]
*  And then it's the longer term effort of some sort of a conference in which all parties [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=957.86s)]
*  come to it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=962.2199999999999s)]
*  And this is what you're seeing over and over again, Carla. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=963.2199999999999s)]
*  You're seeing the new effort is, okay, let's not leave anybody out. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=964.74s)]
*  Let's make sure we're getting both the two main sides, the militias that are fighting [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=968.42s)]
*  under each of them, and then the outside actors who are supporting them. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=972.98s)]
*  And this includes, you know, in addition to the UAE, Iran's got involvement, as I said, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=976.8199999999999s)]
*  the Saudis, the Egyptians, the Ethiopians, to some extent. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=981.6999999999999s)]
*  So it's getting all the parties into this process and coming up with some sort of plan [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=986.02s)]
*  in which they are speaking candidly about who controls or what's the mechanism for [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=991.38s)]
*  giving up control in Sudan. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=996.3s)]
*  The only other thing I would mention in this regard is there was said to be a great deal [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=998.9399999999999s)]
*  of angst and wringing of hands when a previous Sudanese war was taking place. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1002.74s)]
*  This was a civil war between North and South, which ultimately led to the creation of a [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1007.38s)]
*  new country, South Sudan. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1011.46s)]
*  There were many times when people said, this is just hopeless. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1013.1400000000001s)]
*  You know, this is just going to go on and on. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1015.46s)]
*  And yet through persistence of an unlikely coalition of groups, including some US evangelicals [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1017.4200000000001s)]
*  and others, they were able to bring about a solution to that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1022.82s)]
*  Things are not great in South Sudan. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1026.5s)]
*  These are not great between South Sudan and Sudan. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1028.02s)]
*  But it's that particularly grinding conflict was ended and a solution was found. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1030.06s)]
*  We'll see what happens here, Carla. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1035.8999999999999s)]
*  But I guess I'm not offering very satisfactory, you know, sort of blueprint for peace. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1036.98s)]
*  Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1041.22s)]
*  This is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1046.6599999999999s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1051.5s)]
*  And this week, Bob, they selected Ecuador VP Jorge Glass arrested in Mexican embassy. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1053.34s)]
*  This is an incredible violation of international norms and specifically the Vienna Convention [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1060.58s)]
*  on Diplomatic Relations from 1961. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1065.5s)]
*  So I look this up and Article 22 says the premises of a diplomatic mission, quote, shall [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1068.86s)]
*  be inviolable. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1074.5s)]
*  The agents of the receiving state may not enter them except with the consent of the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1076.0s)]
*  head of the mission. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1080.3799999999999s)]
*  And here they were kicking down the door, going after these guys. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1081.8s)]
*  What were the Ecuadorians thinking? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1085.1599999999999s)]
*  That remains a really big question, actually. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1088.72s)]
*  And not only this sort of stunning violation of what has been a mostly sacrosanct part [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1091.24s)]
*  of international law playing out, but also the reports since then are that first of all, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1096.78s)]
*  that when they seized Jorge Glass, they beat him rather brutally. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1102.52s)]
*  They have stuck him away in a prison where he had lost consciousness. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1106.32s)]
*  There is not a great deal of hope that he's going to be treated in any sort of proper [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1110.2s)]
*  fashion. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1114.3600000000001s)]
*  It's still unclear the extent to which he represents a threat to the Ecuadorian leadership [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  right now. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1120.48s)]
*  They had said that he had represented a serious flight risk and they had to do what they did. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1121.48s)]
*  But again, there are diplomatic norms that are really important and also cut multiple [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1126.8600000000001s)]
*  ways because this also affects people who are outside of Ecuador who might be seeking [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1131.52s)]
*  asylum in another mission that Ecuador would like to protect and yet can't. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1136.18s)]
*  So for them to do this has raised concerns that the leadership of NOBOA is going to turn [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1140.46s)]
*  this particularly hard line now and start to really violate all sorts of norms and exert [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1146.7s)]
*  more control, especially on law enforcement. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1152.8200000000002s)]
*  And our colleague, Will Freeman at CFR has said he's concerned about NOBOA turning into [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1156.22s)]
*  what he's called a bukule direction, citing the leader of El Salvador, who's taken extremely [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1162.12s)]
*  hard line steps, Nayib Bukele, to quash crime and the gangs that have been dominating El [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1166.6s)]
*  Salvador and had caused, by the way, a lot of flight out of the country. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1172.52s)]
*  But he's also very popular now. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1175.6799999999998s)]
*  He's suppressed crime, he's changed the calculus, and he's also grossly violated norms of both [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1177.8s)]
*  cracking down on crime, of treating the incarcerated and so forth. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1183.58s)]
*  So we don't know whether this is the early harbinger of Ecuador turning in a really bad [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  direction because of its acknowledged crime problems and corruption problems. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1191.12s)]
*  But it's bad for international law, it's bad for Ecuador-Mexico relations, and in general, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1196.28s)]
*  raising a lot of serious questions about what's going on in Ecuador. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1202.04s)]
*  Across Latin America, 19 of the 20 countries that came to this extraordinary meeting of [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1205.9199999999998s)]
*  foreign ministers of the community of Latin American Caribbean states, CELAC, denounced [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1212.02s)]
*  And these are people who are of different ideological colors and international law experts, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1218.12s)]
*  the United States, the OAS, people from the left, people from the right. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1226.3999999999999s)]
*  And there's an irony, of course, in this as well. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1230.28s)]
*  If you recall, Julian Assange was hanging out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1232.28s)]
*  there was some suggestion that the UK government might raid them, and the Ecuadorians went [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1236.52s)]
*  completely nuts about this. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1240.76s)]
*  And then there's also this great sort of pissing match between AMLO, the Mexican president [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1243.16s)]
*  that's going on between him and Nuboa. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1247.98s)]
*  But in the end of the day, this is one of the sins against which all others are measured. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1250.7s)]
*  You don't mess around in other countries' diplomatic soil. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1255.14s)]
*  These countries are, this is considered sovereign soil. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1259.18s)]
*  So it could well be a harbinger of a terrible crackdown, or it could just be really crazy [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1262.66s)]
*  tunes. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1268.26s)]
*  Either way, it's not a good look for Ecuador. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1269.26s)]
*  It is not a good look for Ecuador. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1271.46s)]
*  And again, it's worth mentioning, they have a legitimately serious problem with drug trafficking [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1273.7s)]
*  gangs and that they've been trying to get a handle on. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1278.82s)]
*  And President Nuboa designated something like 22 gangs as terror groups. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1282.5s)]
*  And Jorge Glass is not a drug trafficker, as far as anyone knows. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1287.22s)]
*  He was accused of a different type of crime, but also a former very senior official. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1292.1399999999999s)]
*  So for them to go so strenuously to seize him and to so grossly violate an international [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1296.6200000000001s)]
*  norm like this, and then to abuse him and beat him while locking him away, it does indicate [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1301.66s)]
*  a bit of the concerning crazy times that you mentioned, Carla. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1307.6200000000001s)]
*  Sort of performance art, substitute for real policy. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqjFmWruZs&t=1312.22s)]
