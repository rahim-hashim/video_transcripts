# Senegal & Slovakia Elections, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban Clash, Nuclear Energy Gains Favor, & More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io)
*  In the coming week, Slovakia and Senegal each hold presidential votes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=0.0s)]
*  Tensions rise between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and more countries are considering energy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=5.0s)]
*  alternatives at the first Nuclear Energy Summit. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=9.6s)]
*  It's March 21, 2024 and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=12.64s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=27.36s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=28.36s)]
*  Bob, the year of elections rolls on and next week citizens in Senegal and Slovakia get [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=29.8s)]
*  to choose their presidents. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=35.56s)]
*  So is this the S-week for elections? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=36.96s)]
*  Back in October, Slovaks voted in pro-Russia Prime Minister Robert Fico, who promptly cut [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=40.12s)]
*  off all aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=45.36s)]
*  And progressive incumbent Susana Chaputova managed to counterbalance Fico in some important [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  areas, but she's decided not to run again. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=56.24s)]
*  Is Fico actually going to be the big winner in this election? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  You have seized on the central issue, I think, Carla. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=61.92s)]
*  First of all, the polling that we're seeing at this point is showing very close numbers [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=66.04s)]
*  for Peter Pellegrini, who is expected to be aligned with Fico. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=71.08s)]
*  He is the current Speaker of the Parliament and he's a former Prime Minister. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=75.4s)]
*  He was a short-time Prime Minister and the better known figure of all the presidential [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=79.92s)]
*  candidates. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=83.92s)]
*  Running fairly close with him is Ivan Korchuk, who's a former Foreign Minister and he's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=84.92s)]
*  a career diplomat and seen as more sort of aligned with a broader diplomacy and a Western-oriented [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=89.76s)]
*  diplomacy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=96.88s)]
*  And so they are very, very close in polling between 35 and 40 percent of the vote in most [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=98.56s)]
*  recent polls, likely to go to a runoff. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=104.72s)]
*  And then the conventional wisdom is that Pellegrini probably has more juice to carry through and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=108.12s)]
*  win in a runoff. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=113.52s)]
*  And then it's a question of whether it will be a sort of Polish model where you start [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=114.88s)]
*  seeing this consolidation of power structures in Slovakia, you know, a move to take over [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  control of media, to sideline or take control or defang, as the case may be, the courts [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=126.52s)]
*  and then kind of go from there. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=133.96s)]
*  So much has been said about comparing Slovakia to Hungary and the illiberal government of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=135.68s)]
*  Viktor Orban. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=141.0s)]
*  And while there are some parallels there, there are some differences. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=142.44s)]
*  It's also interesting that as we've talked many times about the rise of the populist [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=145.32s)]
*  right in Europe, Fico is the populist left, although from his perspective, he's still [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=149.72s)]
*  doing things that have been more aligned with the right, such as opening up discussion about [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=155.08s)]
*  the Western support for Ukraine. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=160.0s)]
*  And as you said, he is trying to move away from joining this Western movement to arm [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=162.6s)]
*  and continually support Ukraine and using things like he is the peace candidate. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=168.56s)]
*  This is Fico, but this is also his aligned political parties as well, that they stand [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  for peace. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  There's a bit of an osteopolitique type approach that they're trying to project, I think, to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  use an old Cold War term in that they don't want to antagonize fully Russia, but try to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  discuss and be a broker, perhaps, Russia as Ukraine war enters its third year. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=189.12s)]
*  But Slovakia is a part of the EU. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  It's a part of NATO. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  So it's all to say this is going to be a very important election to watch and whether or [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=197.84s)]
*  not we see Slovak move into an illiberal direction or whether there's going to be some sort of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=201.88s)]
*  a hedge on that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=206.52s)]
*  So when Fico was running, we saw a considerable amount of disinformation racing around in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=208.6s)]
*  their media space and attributed to the Russians. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=215.28s)]
*  Are we seeing this again? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=218.72s)]
*  I'm not seeing that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=220.32s)]
*  I think it's safe to say that it is occurring. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  I think there's also been a... [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=224.36s)]
*  The guard is up on the opposition forces in Slovakia to counter any such misinformation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=225.56s)]
*  But I do also think that you mentioned Susana Chaputova not running. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  I think her decision not to run is in part because of the really difficult landscape [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=236.4s)]
*  it is to be a candidate in a country like Slovakia right now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=241.56s)]
*  And so she was certainly dealing with a lot of things like hate speech and so forth. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=245.28s)]
*  And she had been standing up to the Fico government on areas like she had tried to delay legislation [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=249.4s)]
*  for constitutional review in the Constitutional Court, for example. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=255.4s)]
*  And so just decided not to seek reelection. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=259.0s)]
*  She probably would have wanted, but she also could have been facing another sort of round [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=262.1s)]
*  of whether it's disinformation, whether it's slander or whatever. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=266.16s)]
*  I think that's out there in Slovak politics right now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=269.8s)]
*  And it's an ugly side of that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=272.56s)]
*  I think you might see something crop up if we do go to the expected runoff round. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=275.8s)]
*  You could see an intensification of what we saw in the Fico election period. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=279.8s)]
*  So it's another sort of tense time for a European election. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=284.28s)]
*  We just recently talked about Portugal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=288.48s)]
*  I think there are efforts underway to build a right of center coalition government there [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=290.52s)]
*  that could include far-right populist elements. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=295.8s)]
*  And the Netherlands is another place we talked about. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=298.4s)]
*  Jert Wilders has not been able to form a coalition. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=300.76s)]
*  So we are looking at another country, another polarized country that's entering into an [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=303.24s)]
*  election period that is happening at a time when Europe is trying to consolidate reform, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=308.28s)]
*  behind support for Ukraine and so forth. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=313.92s)]
*  And that's becoming more and more difficult, it looks like. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=315.64s)]
*  So moving to another problematic election in West Africa and Senegal. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=319.24s)]
*  This country, which used to be really quite a stable place, and it's been struggling ever [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=324.28s)]
*  since President Mackie Sall postponed elections back in February, which sparked pretty violent protests. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  So he is, my understanding, this was a guy who limited his own term length and seemed [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=335.08s)]
*  to be really committed to democracy. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=342.76s)]
*  And then he's like, those people who embrace term limits and then suddenly decided they [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=344.52s)]
*  didn't like them. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=348.6s)]
*  So he postponed things and there were a lot of protests. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  And then the court said, no way, you got to go ahead with it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  So these elections are finally going ahead this Sunday under court order. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=356.08s)]
*  Sall isn't running, but it's not clear that the vote is going to calm things down. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=360.44s)]
*  So what are you watching for there? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=364.4s)]
*  Yeah, as you indicate, it's a big deal, first and foremost, because Senegal has been this [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=366.52s)]
*  pole of stability. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=372.0s)]
*  It's never had a military coup in its post-colonial period. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=373.28s)]
*  That's significant, especially in a time period in which there have been multiple military [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=376.64s)]
*  coups in West Africa. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=380.2s)]
*  Sall and Mackysall himself have tried to be a leader in the region as well, and a leader [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=382.6s)]
*  in terms of professing rule of law and governance and democratic virtues and so forth. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  And then here you have Mackysall saying, you know what, we're not going to have these elections [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=391.8s)]
*  just a few weeks ahead of the scheduled elections. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  He announced it would be delayed till the end of the year. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  And it was a highly unusual period of time. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=401.6s)]
*  He has maintained that he was trying to resolve some sort of dispute over the eligibility [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=404.14000000000004s)]
*  of presidential candidates and that members of parliament had urged him to do this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=408.7s)]
*  But there are others in the political sphere who dismissed this and called it a sort of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=412.82s)]
*  a standard power grab by a sitting leader, which we have seen all too often in Africa. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=417.06s)]
*  But again, this is a country that is governed differently. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=421.82s)]
*  There is rule of law that's holding sway here. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=424.52s)]
*  Sall is now saying he's going to be leaving office by April 2nd, as he's supposed to. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=426.42s)]
*  In the case of a runoff, the head of the National Assembly, Amadou Diop, would be the interim [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=430.62s)]
*  leader. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=434.9s)]
*  So we are entering into a competitive election period in a country that has, it must be noted, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=435.9s)]
*  a very large youth cohort, something like 60% of Senegalese are under the age of 25. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=442.02s)]
*  And so you're seeing candidates courting that vote. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=449.09999999999997s)]
*  Youth were in the streets protesting when Sall announced the delay. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=452.38s)]
*  And so I think you're going to see a lot of activism. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=455.5s)]
*  I'm not sure what it's going to translate to in terms of where support is going to go, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=457.94s)]
*  Whether it's going to be the ruling government coalition candidate, Amadou Ba, or whether [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=462.02s)]
*  it's going to be the main challenger, Basiru Fayy, but Senegal is in for another sort of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=466.24s)]
*  rough period potentially, given that we've had violence, we've had fatal violence in [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=471.66s)]
*  and around the protests over the delayed attempt by Macky Sall. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=476.52s)]
*  Well, I'm a real believer in shortened campaigns. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=480.9s)]
*  But this is really, I mean, not just a short campaign, this is a really short transition. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=485.65999999999997s)]
*  He says what he's going to get out when April 1st, is that what he said? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=490.46s)]
*  April 2nd. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=493.85999999999996s)]
*  April 2nd. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=494.85999999999996s)]
*  And we are into March here. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=495.85999999999996s)]
*  There's a really short campaign, really short election counting period, and he's finally [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=498.53999999999996s)]
*  getting out. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  This is really, maybe if they can do it and move on, that would be great. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=504.82s)]
*  But it's certainly something to watch because given the level of disruption there, it's [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=508.85999999999996s)]
*  a real fast turnaround. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=512.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=513.86s)]
*  And I think we're in for a ride in Senegal and again, a part of the world that can ill [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=514.86s)]
*  afford another sort of unstable electoral period could be in for one. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=519.5s)]
*  But we'll see. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=524.02s)]
*  This is a test. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=525.02s)]
*  Senegal again, has had strong institutions. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=526.02s)]
*  It has a well-run by many accounts, a well-run economy, well-run government. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=529.42s)]
*  There are still issues though out there such as corruption in particular that are seen [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=534.06s)]
*  to be galvanizing for an opposition. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=537.98s)]
*  So we'll see if we do get a runoff period, if we do get sort of a vacuum, a leadership [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=540.58s)]
*  vacuum when a strong leader like Saul steps down on April 2nd and there's not yet an [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=546.54s)]
*  elected candidate. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=551.26s)]
*  That's a real test for West Africa and for the region as a whole. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=552.86s)]
*  And we should just say that in the context of other military coups, we just had the very [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=557.14s)]
*  poor country of Niger announce it was cutting off its military ties with the United States. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=561.54s)]
*  That was a big development in the last week or so. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=566.14s)]
*  You have a courting of Russia's Wagner group in the region. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=568.78s)]
*  You have all sorts of alliances taking shape that are not looking good for democracy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=572.16s)]
*  Senegal, it would be good to have a Senegalese peaceful transfer of power as it has in the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=577.48s)]
*  past. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=581.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, Carla, let's take our attention to South Asia where Pakistan for one will be [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  marking its Republic Day on Saturday, March 23rd. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=588.6s)]
*  But Republic Day is coming at a period of some increasing tensions, security tensions [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=592.24s)]
*  in particular. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=597.0799999999999s)]
*  It's got domestic tensions, but it also has security tensions with a force that until [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=598.08s)]
*  fairly recently seemed to be aligned with, which is the Taliban leadership of Afghanistan. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=603.44s)]
*  Now just this past Monday, Pakistan fired missiles into Afghan territory. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  So Carla, given this latest exchange of fire, what is going on between Pakistan and the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=613.08s)]
*  Afghan's Taliban leadership? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=618.84s)]
*  So let's stipulate that I don't think this is going to escalate into a major hot war, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  You can never tell. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  Pakistan still values good relations with a Taliban controlled Afghanistan at a minimum [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=627.92s)]
*  because it doesn't want India getting in there and it doesn't want to be encircled. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  And the Taliban have almost no friends. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=636.6s)]
*  So they would like to keep some form of relationship with Pakistan. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=639.76s)]
*  So I think both sides have a pretty strong incentive to keep this on a low boil. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=645.16s)]
*  At the same time, the Pakistanis are accusing the Afghans of providing safe haven to militants, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=649.76s)]
*  who've been staging attacks on their territory. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=654.4s)]
*  And for those of us who've watched the Pakistanis play all sides for two decades, supporting [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  and enabling militants from Afghanistan on their own territory while taking money from [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=662.72s)]
*  the US, we must say that there's no small amount of irony in here. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=668.56s)]
*  So early Monday, the Pakistan launched these airstrikes on what we presume were bases for [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=672.54s)]
*  the TTP, which are the Taliban or Pakistan in two provinces in eastern Afghanistan, reportedly [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  killing eight people, including three children. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=683.68s)]
*  And the Afghan Taliban responded by firing on Pakistani positions along the border. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=687.12s)]
*  And these strikes from Pakistan came after an armed group with suicide vests and a truck [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=691.68s)]
*  packed with explosives attacked a military post in northwestern Pakistan, killing seven [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  security force members. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=701.0s)]
*  On Monday evening, the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement accusing [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=703.56s)]
*  the Afghan Taliban of enabling the Pakistani Taliban. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=707.92s)]
*  These are separate groups. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=711.2199999999999s)]
*  And it said that over the past two years, the Pakistani government has repeatedly urged [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=713.08s)]
*  Afghan authorities to take concrete and effective action to ensure that Afghan soil is not used [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=716.7800000000001s)]
*  as a staging ground for terrorism. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=721.64s)]
*  And it accused, quote, certain elements among those in power in Afghanistan of actively [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=724.64s)]
*  patronizing the TTP and using them as a proxy against Pakistan. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=729.2s)]
*  That doesn't sound good. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=733.38s)]
*  And you know, Bob, we discussed in the run up to Pakistan's election how the country [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=734.84s)]
*  has seen a rise in terrorist attacks since the Taliban returned to power. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=738.5200000000001s)]
*  And that number of attacks was up 20% last year. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=742.6s)]
*  So these strikes seem to be a sign of the new Sharif government is going to take a much [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=746.12s)]
*  harder line than its predecessors. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=750.72s)]
*  So we'll see whether or not they can keep this to a low boil. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=752.48s)]
*  And meanwhile, as ever, the Afghan people are the ones who are getting squeezed. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=756.1800000000001s)]
*  Last fall, the previous government in Pakistan announced that all unregistered foreigners, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  of which Afghans are by far the largest group, were deemed to be security risks and they [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=764.62s)]
*  had to get out of the country before the end of the year. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=768.54s)]
*  And by December, more than 400,000 Afghans of an estimated 1.6 million had gone back [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=771.98s)]
*  to Afghanistan. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=777.76s)]
*  And since then, it's estimated another 100,000 have been forced out. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=778.76s)]
*  And the prediction is that as soon as Ramadan is over with, they're going to go back to [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=783.2s)]
*  expelling more and more Afghans back into Afghan territory. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=786.9s)]
*  And we know that the situation in Afghanistan is really pretty horrible, incredibly repressive, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=790.04s)]
*  vast hunger, drought. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=796.0s)]
*  These are the people who suffer. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=799.48s)]
*  Yeah, it strikes me as an extraordinary turn of events, Carla. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=800.98s)]
*  As you said, you know, there are journalists and AFPAC watchers of a certain age who have [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=804.14s)]
*  just so accustomed to seeing this Pakistan-Afghan-Taliban relationship that had mutual benefits, seemingly [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=809.58s)]
*  had mutual benefits, the strategic depth for Pakistan in Afghanistan, and obviously the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=815.66s)]
*  haven and support for the Afghan Taliban when they were fighting the US military and its [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=820.3000000000001s)]
*  attempt to build a nation state in Afghanistan. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=825.98s)]
*  And now to have them fighting like this, and also, you know, these are ethnically aligned [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=829.26s)]
*  groups. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=834.48s)]
*  I mean, the Pashtuns, it's a, if you draw a map of ethnicity, you can draw a giant block [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=835.48s)]
*  of Pashtuns that crosses the Afghan-Pakistan border pretty extensively. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=840.3199999999999s)]
*  But I guess this gets into the tribal differences among other things. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=845.64s)]
*  As you pointed out, these subgroups and the Pakistani Taliban being an anti-government [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=849.2s)]
*  force that for whatever reason, the Afghan Taliban have decided to make common cause [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=854.08s)]
*  Is that what's happening here? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=858.54s)]
*  Is there anything else? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=859.6s)]
*  Is any other turf that we should be aware of that's under issue here? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=860.5s)]
*  Honestly, I don't know. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=863.64s)]
*  All I know is that Pakistan has been enabling a whole bunch of groups for a really long [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=865.08s)]
*  period of time. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=869.44s)]
*  And not surprisingly, this would come back and bite them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=870.1s)]
*  And the response of the Afghan Taliban has been basically to shrug when the Pakistanis [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=873.6s)]
*  complain about it and say, maybe you should be negotiating with these guys. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=880.04s)]
*  That's not all that much of a surprise either. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=883.4s)]
*  And the Afghan Taliban themselves, I'm sure there are divisions inside them about what, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=885.88s)]
*  it's interesting that the Pakistanis said, referred to groups within the ruling Taliban, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=893.32s)]
*  that there are divisions. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=899.5600000000001s)]
*  And we know there are groups, divisions within the divisions between Kabul and Kandahar. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=900.4s)]
*  We know there are divisions in there. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=904.4s)]
*  I mean, this is not particularly organized government as well. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=905.6s)]
*  So what a surprise that there's a certain measure of chaos in Afghanistan itself. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=908.88s)]
*  But the Afghan people in Pakistan are the ones who are suffering a great deal. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=913.96s)]
*  And so whether they can keep this a low boil or whether this escalates, we'll see. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=918.64s)]
*  And not least because the lack of legitimacy of the Pakistan government as well. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=924.0400000000001s)]
*  And this new government, we talked about that a few weeks ago, and certainly they have to [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=928.6s)]
*  prove to their own people that they are in charge and the military is pulling the strings [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=932.52s)]
*  there as well. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=936.48s)]
*  And it's going to be also worth watching whether the Afghan Taliban leadership feels like [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=937.36s)]
*  they can generate support to continue to extricate themselves from support dependency on [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=942.4s)]
*  Pakistan and turn towards neighbors, potentially Iran. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=947.48s)]
*  There's been reports of that or even Russia or China to some extent. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  They might be seeking a new sort of balance in the region because they used to rely on [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=955.04s)]
*  Pakistan for the arms. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=959.12s)]
*  The group known as a Haqqani Network certainly did. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=960.24s)]
*  But now the arms got to be coming from somewhere and it's not clear whether they have opened [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=962.9599999999999s)]
*  up some new avenues. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=967.92s)]
*  And then they also have their own internal terrorism problem, irony upon irony with ISIS. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=969.6s)]
*  So it is a rough neighborhood, a very rough neighborhood. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=975.44s)]
*  I understand why we wanted to get out, but we left and the vacuum has become more dangerous. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=979.48s)]
*  Bob, let's head over to Belgium today. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=987.12s)]
*  I'd love to. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=989.32s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=990.24s)]
*  We all want chocolate and we want moules and we want french fries with Bernays sauce. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=991.52s)]
*  Yes, I'm hungry. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=996.4000000000001s)]
*  So Brussels hosts the Global Nuclear Energy Summit. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=997.72s)]
*  I think they're doing that with the IAEA, right? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1000.84s)]
*  And this is the first and highest level meeting exclusively focused on nuclear energy. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1003.1600000000001s)]
*  And for those of us who are IAEA nerds, we know that the IAEA actually has a dual mission. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1008.36s)]
*  One is it's supposed to control the spread of nuclear weapons technology at the same [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1013.72s)]
*  time when it champions the joys of peaceful nuclear power. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  This is the Atoms for Peace bargain. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1023.84s)]
*  And senior officials, particularly ministers of energy from about 30 countries and industry [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1026.4s)]
*  professionals are meeting to discuss innovations and global opportunities to address climate [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1030.5600000000002s)]
*  change through nuclear technology. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1035.44s)]
*  You know, there's always been enthusiasm in Europe for nuclear power as a carbon neutral [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1038.48s)]
*  source, although after Fukushima, it looked like it was losing a lot of its luster. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1042.24s)]
*  Does the summit mean that the excitement is back? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1046.3600000000001s)]
*  It's quite possible, Carla. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1048.88s)]
*  As I was reading about this event that's playing out today and tomorrow, I was surprised that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1050.6000000000001s)]
*  there had not been one before that was focused solely on nuclear energy. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1055.08s)]
*  And the statements that are coming out from the IAEA, from officials like Fatih Birol [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1059.0s)]
*  of the International Energy Agency and other government leaders, it's basically all adding [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1064.28s)]
*  up to, you know, nuclear power should come in from the cold and it's time that it be [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1068.9199999999998s)]
*  wedded to in a responsible way and with all the caveats, but that it's time that it be [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1073.96s)]
*  associated more firmly with reaching climate targets because nuclear energy can deliver [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1079.72s)]
*  lots of energy, certainly. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1084.44s)]
*  And that's not been its problem. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1086.68s)]
*  It's problem, as we well know, and Europe well knows whether it was the Fukushima disaster [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1088.1200000000001s)]
*  as a reminder, or certainly those are the memory of the Chernobyl accident. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1093.16s)]
*  Nuclear energy can be very dangerous. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  And it's also there is a expensive sort of long runway to standing up nuclear energy [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1099.32s)]
*  reactors because of all the concern over safeguards in addition to that, just the sheer [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1104.56s)]
*  cost in standing up a highly functional nuclear plant. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1109.2s)]
*  But as France has shown, France, I believe to this day gets something like 70% of its [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1112.56s)]
*  power from nuclear energy. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1117.04s)]
*  It went all in on it years ago. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1118.64s)]
*  It's a famous case study. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1120.32s)]
*  And I think the time has come and you're hearing French officials say this, the United States, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1122.08s)]
*  which gets a decent amount, I think up to 20% of its power still from nuclear energy [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1126.48s)]
*  also is making the case as well. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1131.04s)]
*  If they can provide the right safeguards, the right financing, just the institutional [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1133.44s)]
*  support of powerful nations and rich nations, they can maybe see this as a reliable part [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1138.8s)]
*  of a sort of all of the above approach to renewable, to carbon free energies, if you [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1144.56s)]
*  add them to the solar and wind power and others that are being championed to replace carbon. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1149.44s)]
*  But they're still, and we're seeing with the kickoff of this summit today, there's still [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1155.28s)]
*  environmental concern that this is just foolhardy to go back on this route. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1158.8s)]
*  And so there's going to be pushback. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  The German government, which has the Green Party in its coalition is certainly one that's [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1165.52s)]
*  not going to be coming out and trumpeting this at this point. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1170.8s)]
*  But there seems to be strong wind, pardon the expression, wind in the sails of nuclear [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1174.0s)]
*  energy. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1178.48s)]
*  And I think we could see this as a moment. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1179.36s)]
*  We could be pointing to this as a moment where it bounced back and it got a bit of a boost. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1181.92s)]
*  And it might be one of the things that adds up to reaching the targets for carbon reduction [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1186.48s)]
*  that still seem to be so elusive. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1192.16s)]
*  And we just got new reminders this week of the global warming and that the last year [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1194.16s)]
*  was the warmest ever. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1199.6000000000001s)]
*  And we're on track for another one. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1201.44s)]
*  There are hot days being reported from Brazil to sub-Saharan Africa, heat levels we haven't [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1204.0s)]
*  seen before. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1210.16s)]
*  It's all to say that I think there is a consciousness to try to do more to react and that the current [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1211.1200000000001s)]
*  efforts have just been inadequate. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1216.96s)]
*  It is carbon neutral, but they don't seem to have solved the storage issue, the waste [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1218.88s)]
*  storage issue. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1225.04s)]
*  And that seems to be all this talk about proliferation resistance and how Fukushima was the result [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1225.68s)]
*  of neglect, not an inevitable error, but waste storage seems to be a really, and the stuff [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1233.04s)]
*  stays around for a really long period of time. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1240.4s)]
*  On the other hand, if you don't want to buy oil and gas from the Saudis or the Russians, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1242.96s)]
*  I suppose that's a big part of the discussion as well. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1248.32s)]
*  As the IAEA well knows, that having peaceful nuclear energy still does not resolve you from [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  responsibility to safeguard, whether it's a country like Iran, which swears it only [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1258.56s)]
*  wants nuclear energy and not its weaponized aspect, or a country like Ukraine, which has [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1263.52s)]
*  now been occupied for two years by Russian forces and it has a nuclear plant that is in [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1268.56s)]
*  very grave danger of a potential accident as the IAEA has warned, the Zaporizhzhia. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1273.68s)]
*  Nuclear energy is something that needs to be carefully treated. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1278.72s)]
*  There's still only something like 30 countries that have it and the safeguards are really [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1282.64s)]
*  important. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1286.8s)]
*  IAEA is an extremely important organization and so there's I think still a long way to [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1287.2s)]
*  go before things really move forward. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1292.5600000000002s)]
*  But again, it looks like there's some momentum. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1294.48s)]
*  And the basic rule of course here is that the same technology that produces fuel for [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1296.64s)]
*  a nuclear power plant with just a little more work can produce fuel for a nuclear weapon. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1302.8000000000002s)]
*  And it'd really be great if they could change the rules that could somehow figure out how [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1307.8400000000001s)]
*  you could have nuclear power with not inevitably being guaranteed if you want the technology to [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1313.68s)]
*  produce fuel, but they haven't been able to reform the NPT for that. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1318.72s)]
*  But that's nerding out for another day. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1322.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, Carla, we're not done yet about important global developments because we have a figure [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1324.88s)]
*  of the week to talk about. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1328.8s)]
*  And that of course is the audience figure of the week. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1330.0s)]
*  This is where listeners vote Tuesday and Wednesday of each week at CFR underscore org's [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1334.24s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1338.88s)]
*  The audience this week selected eight, as in eight billion, as in the EU's eight billion [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1340.4s)]
*  dollar aid package to Egypt. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1345.6s)]
*  So what's going on here? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1347.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1348.48s)]
*  First of all, I'm totally bummed that they didn't choose Obama's surprise visit to 10, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1350.72s)]
*  number 10 Downing Street. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1355.76s)]
*  So I'm going to take the prerogative and talk about that for just a little bit. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1357.2s)]
*  Please do. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1360.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1361.44s)]
*  So I was remembering when we put this on how Obama drove London wild in his first visit as [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1361.84s)]
*  president for a G20 meeting in 2009. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1367.68s)]
*  I don't know if you remember that, Bob. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1370.0s)]
*  And he was on his way to number 10 Downing Street to meet with the prime minister. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1372.16s)]
*  He shook the hand of a London Bobby who was standing guard. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1376.32s)]
*  And people usually ignored these guys, right? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1380.1599999999999s)]
*  And when the Bobby then stretched out his hand, I mean, he was so surprised to then [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1382.8799999999999s)]
*  British prime minister Gordon Brown. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  Brown, of course, ignored it. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1388.24s)]
*  I mean, his guards were like wallpaper. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1389.52s)]
*  And this, of course, led everybody to talk about how fabulously, you know, the Americans, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1391.9199999999998s)]
*  they're so democratic. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1396.8s)]
*  As for this informal Obama visit, the Guardian reported that during his hour long tea meeting [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1398.96s)]
*  with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, they talked about AI and other subjects. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1405.52s)]
*  So I had to just get that in there because it was a wonderful memory. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1409.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1413.76s)]
*  On to the Egypt EU deal. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1414.08s)]
*  On Sunday, Ursula von der Leyen, the EU president and five other leaders signed an agreement [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1416.16s)]
*  committing $8 billion in aid and loans, which are going to be doled out over four years to Egypt. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1420.96s)]
*  And it's intended to help bolster what is an economy that's in desperate shape. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1426.56s)]
*  But ultimately, what the EU cares about is reducing out migration, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1431.68s)]
*  including by strengthening border controls. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1436.0s)]
*  This is one of several deals that the EU has been making. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1438.96s)]
*  We obviously knew about Turkey, you know, Tunisia, Mauritania, soon was Morocco. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1442.0s)]
*  And Georgia Maloney, Italy's PM, who's been trying to put a kinder and gentler face on her [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1447.3600000000001s)]
*  fierce anti-immigrant rhetoric, described the Egypt deal as a chance, and this is pretty creepy, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1453.44s)]
*  to give quote, residents of Africa a chance, quote, not to emigrate to Europe. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1459.76s)]
*  Propping up Egypt, everybody has a real interest in Egypt these days, not least because of the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1466.48s)]
*  role it's playing to try to help negotiate a temporary ceasefire for hostage deal. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1470.08s)]
*  There's lots of reasons why you don't want Egypt to collapse. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1474.56s)]
*  But I think human rights advocates are right to also raise questions about given [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1477.44s)]
*  pretty large checks to the CC government. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1481.52s)]
*  And they are criticizing this deal for putting a lot of money into an autocrat, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1484.24s)]
*  including the autocrat running Tunisia and certainly into Egypt without clear conditionality [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1488.6399999999999s)]
*  on their human rights behavior. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1493.6799999999998s)]
*  Last year, Tunisia blocked EU lawmakers who tried to go to the country to check on how the money was [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1495.36s)]
*  being used, and the Tunisians said, no, thank you. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1499.9199999999998s)]
*  It seems like an attempt to try to echo the deal with Turkey back in 2015, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1503.2s)]
*  but very different circumstances. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1508.08s)]
*  And it must be said Erdogan has done a better job of hosting a very large community of refugees, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1509.76s)]
*  even though there's still an understandable desire to create some more permanent living [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1516.48s)]
*  plan for those refugees in Turkey, which is numbers more than two million, I think still to this day. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1522.48s)]
*  But as you say, North Africa, very different track record, very different leadership. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1527.92s)]
*  And it's hard not to be cynical when you see this. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1532.48s)]

*  dealing with the really unchecked flows of migrants of all sorts crossing the Mediterranean. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1542.08s)]
*  And so, yeah, I don't know whether we're going to see more announcements of this type or whether [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1547.6s)]
*  we're going to see Egypt in some way turn a page, but it doesn't seem like it's solving much at this [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1552.0s)]

*  is everybody's very nervous about this June parliamentary elections that are coming up. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1560.48s)]
*  And polls in Europe, like polls here cite migration as a main concern of voters. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1564.08s)]
*  And their migration numbers are bouncing up again as well. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1568.56s)]

*  for hostages deal. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1611.9199999999998s)]
*  So nobody wants Egypt to collapse, but an unconditioned aid without taking human rights [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1614.0s)]
*  into concerns, that makes me queasy. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokNTURe-Io&t=1620.0s)]
