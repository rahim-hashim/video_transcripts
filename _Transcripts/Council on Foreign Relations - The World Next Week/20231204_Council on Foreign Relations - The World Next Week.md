# Winter Stalemate in Ukraine, Argentina’s Presidential Runoff, Turkey’s President in Berlin, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho)
*  In the coming week, Ukraine begins a second winter at war while U.S. lawmakers weigh whether [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=0.0s)]
*  to support the fight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Argentinians choose their president amid spiraling inflation, and Turkey's President [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=7.36s)]
*  Erdogan visits Berlin. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=10.88s)]
*  It's November 16, 2023, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=12.56s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=27.68s)]
*  And I'm Karla Ann Robbins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=28.9s)]
*  Karla, let's start in Ukraine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=30.5s)]
*  It's been over a year and a half now since the February 2022 invasion by Russia, and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=32.58s)]
*  the conflict grinds on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  Ukraine's counteroffensive momentum, such as it was, has stalled in the last five months. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=40.46s)]
*  There's growing concern about a possible Russian bombing campaign stepping up, just as the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=46.34s)]
*  coldest months of winter roll in. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  At the same time, there's a whole lot of political maneuvering happening in the U.S. Congress, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  where the future of U.S. military to Ukraine is uncertain. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=57.5s)]
*  So in the bigger scheme of things here, what is it going to look like for Ukraine to break [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=60.86000000000001s)]
*  the stalemate or at least show some momentum? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=64.44s)]
*  Well, the Ukrainians are certainly worried about that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  Zelensky just said that he doesn't want another frozen conflict. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=69.98s)]
*  He certainly does know about frozen conflicts. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=73.84s)]
*  He went through this with Crimea. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  And it has been a very hard counteroffensive. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=78.38s)]
*  It has truly stalled as the only word you can use for it, or stalemate, which the Ukrainian [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  military used that term just last week. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=86.38s)]
*  They've advanced only 17 kilometers since June, and they're nowhere close to their goal [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  of breaking that land bridge that links Crimea and Russia. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=94.3s)]
*  This is a really hard thing to do. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  They're fighting deeply dug in forces. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=99.94s)]
*  It's very easy to drop mines, very hard to dig them out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=102.02s)]
*  And Ukraine's commander in chief told the economists, you know, just like in the first [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=106.38s)]
*  World War, we've reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=110.22s)]
*  And he said they need new technological weapons, systems and innovative approaches to break [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=114.86s)]
*  out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=119.1s)]
*  So what we think he's asking for are things like advanced drones, for mine breaching technology, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=120.22s)]
*  for new decoy systems to defeat Russian missiles. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=125.34s)]
*  They need a lot more help. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=128.8s)]
*  And you know, everybody loves a winner. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=130.66s)]
*  And right now they're not losing, but they're not winning. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=133.62s)]
*  And war is hard, and this is a particularly hard one. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=137.1s)]
*  Now, they've made some progress in the Black Sea using missiles and drones that have been [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=139.9s)]
*  supplied by us and by the Europeans. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=144.22s)]
*  Early this month, the Ukrainians launched cruise missiles supplied by France against [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=146.9s)]
*  a Russian ship yard in Crimea and reportedly did serious damage to one of the newest ships [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=150.3s)]
*  in Russia's fleet. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=154.26s)]
*  And they've been able to resume merchant shipping from southern ports. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=155.78s)]
*  So there's been a little bit of progress there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=158.86s)]
*  But this counteroffensive that everybody was waiting for really has gone almost nowhere. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=161.22s)]
*  And you know, it's hard to read at the same time what's going on with the Russians. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=165.86s)]
*  They, you know, this expected winter bombing campaign hasn't started. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=169.34s)]
*  Some positive, perhaps they're running short on missiles, or maybe they're just waiting [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=173.82s)]
*  for it to get really cold to start it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=177.5s)]
*  Russians have a lot of people, they're still calling up a lot of people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=180.66s)]
*  The Ukrainians, there's a fear they're running low on manpower. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=183.22s)]
*  So there's this real fear of a frozen conflict. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=185.98s)]
*  And you add on top of this, this concern about whether the United States is going to come [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  through on aid. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=192.1s)]
*  So Karla, just a few things to follow up there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  One on the aid front, is there any sign that if the US, you know, levels off or even just [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=196.14s)]
*  closes off or stalls aid for a while, that the Europeans step in? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=202.34s)]
*  There have been some indications that they might be willing to do more on that front, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=206.06s)]
*  but they're also dealing with their own set of domestic pushback and elections and so [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  forth. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=214.22s)]
*  And then separately, Ukrainian morale itself, you mentioned this term stalemate. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=215.22s)]
*  It has always been said that the Ukrainians are the more motivated side in this war. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=220.86s)]
*  And the Russians, you know, quickly called, first of all, made it illegal to refer to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  it as a war domestically. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  And they started calling up everybody from prisoners to ethnic minorities to fill in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=230.38s)]
*  the ranks and as other people fled the country. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  But it just seems like there's more happening here that we're just not aware of, maybe on [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=236.22s)]
*  the Russian side. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=240.38s)]
*  So the Europeans are vowing that they'll do whatever it takes, which is what we've heard [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=242.18s)]
*  again and again from President Biden. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=247.22s)]
*  And I don't doubt President Biden's commitment to it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=248.9s)]
*  And interestingly enough, I don't doubt the commitment of a majority of the United States [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=251.78s)]
*  Senate and probably a majority of the US House. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=255.7s)]
*  A big part of this has to do with parliamentary maneuvering and what happens on the Hill. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=259.06s)]
*  They passed finally, we're not going to have a shutdown this weekend, but whether or not [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=263.62s)]
*  they can get this through the Rules Committee in the House, whether they can get past 60, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=267.06s)]
*  you know, all the problems that we all know about what happens on Capitol Hill, that's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=272.06s)]
*  really what's holding things up here in the United States. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=276.14s)]
*  In Europe, the former prime minister and now foreign secretary of Britain is in Ukraine [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=279.82s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=284.14s)]
*  He's vowing to do whatever it takes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=285.38s)]
*  You're hearing this from most European, but not all European countries, but they don't [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=286.86s)]
*  have the resources. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=290.78s)]
*  They certainly don't have the military resources the way the United States does. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=291.78s)]
*  They don't have the deep pockets of the US to do things. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=294.5s)]
*  We've got a lot more equipment and we're worrying about backing and filling our own resources. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=297.34s)]
*  They need the United States to keep this going. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=301.3s)]
*  I don't see right now a plan to get this money through. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=304.46s)]
*  Interestingly enough, I also don't see a plan to get the money for Israel through. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=308.02s)]
*  A lot of it has to do with this deep isolationist streak of the Republican Party and a lot of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=311.68s)]
*  it has to do with the dysfunction in Washington. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=317.6s)]
*  This is really, really frightening. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=320.04s)]
*  When you hear Zelensky for the first time using this term frozen conflict, he's obviously [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=321.64s)]
*  very concerned because this international tension has been shifted away because of what's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=326.6s)]
*  happening in Gaza and because of the dysfunction in Washington. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=331.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=335.76s)]
*  That dysfunction, what we're seeing in reports is that it starts with some deep divisions [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=336.76s)]
*  within the Republican House members themselves. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=342.62s)]
*  They got this spending extension through, but at the cost of some increasing bitterness [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  and just sort of altercations in the hallways, things you haven't heard before happening. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=351.0s)]
*  People elbowing each other in the hallways. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=356.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  So that's not great news for the US. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  It's regular state of affairs, but certainly for allies in countries like Ukraine, so dependent [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=361.0s)]
*  on the support. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=365.8s)]
*  As you say, even Israeli aid where there's no real major challenge to it, and yet that's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=367.08s)]
*  going to get caught up in this process as well. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm wondering if we get into the winter now, the Russians call Diedam Rotz, Father Frost, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=374.64s)]
*  whether or not there's this leakiness of sanctions and fatigue that Putin's been counting on, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=380.94s)]
*  he's going to be able to test that this winter or not, or whether we learn how deep the divisions [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=386.56s)]
*  in Russia are. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=390.94s)]
*  Well, it's a big difference between trying to run a war on a democracy and run a war [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=392.34s)]
*  on an autocracy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=397.5s)]
*  He throws people in jail who criticize and complain, and the war's not being fought on [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=400.18s)]
*  their soil. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=404.66s)]
*  He's managed to keep a lid on it, although we've seen things like the pre-votion and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=407.62s)]
*  the problems that they've had there. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=411.74s)]
*  As you said, they called people up from far out and far away, but they're calling up a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=414.26s)]
*  lot of people, and it's got to have some reverberations. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=419.1s)]
*  I think if you wanted to ask what Putin's strategy is, Putin's waiting for Trump to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=422.38s)]
*  win the election. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=425.94s)]
*  He is holding on, and I think the frightening thing about that strategy is that he may not [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  have to hold on even that long to the US election. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=433.14000000000004s)]
*  If that money doesn't come through from the Congress, I think that Ukraine is going to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  be in a whole world of trouble. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=440.38s)]
*  And again, Trump is clearly leading the field of GOP candidates for president. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=442.5s)]
*  He's made no secret that he would take a different tack on the Ukraine-Russia war. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=446.86s)]
*  He says he could end it right away. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=450.1s)]
*  He's not in favor of supporting Ukraine inside the way the US has been. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=451.54s)]
*  And there are many members of the Republican Party who are swayed by that, even those who [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  support Ukraine. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=461.14s)]
*  It's just, as you say, it's a waiting game that appears to be playing out right now. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=462.14s)]
*  You can see shifts. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=466.98s)]
*  I mean, you saw Slovakia was a huge supporter of Ukraine, and then they have a political [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=467.98s)]
*  shift and they want to cut off all aid. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=472.0s)]
*  This impulse, well, let's spend the money at home, is not solely in the United States. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=474.54s)]
*  But in a situation like this with Ukraine, when the Ukrainians say you're either going [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=478.74s)]
*  to fight them there or you're going to end up fighting them here, I think they are really [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=482.54s)]
*  the front line in this pushback against Putin. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=487.56s)]
*  And Americans got that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=489.98s)]
*  And if we have a limited attention span, I think Zelensky gets us. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=491.94s)]
*  I think he knows it, and I think that's why he sounds so worried about it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think he should be worried about it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=500.86s)]
*  I'm worried about it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=502.1s)]
*  Just a final note on that front is not to dismiss the sort of creativity and the resourcefulness [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=503.58000000000004s)]
*  of Ukrainians in terms of being able to fight asymmetrically and put up a resistance, even [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=507.94s)]
*  in the way that they've sort of run an end around the embargo of their grain. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=514.26s)]
*  They're still getting grain out through other ways by hook and by crook that are avoiding [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=518.14s)]
*  some of the Russian bombardment, much less than previous pre-war levels. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=522.4200000000001s)]
*  But they've been able to maneuver that in sort of creative ways. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=526.7s)]
*  They've often said, as Russia chews up more Ukrainian territory and absorbs the country, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=530.18s)]
*  if it goes in that direction, it will then be swallowing a porcupine. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=534.62s)]
*  And so there's that whole aspect as well. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=538.02s)]
*  But it's not a great position that they wanted to be in at this point in the war. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=540.66s)]
*  And Zelensky said that when he talked about the frozen conflict, he said, fight us, you'll [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=544.6999999999999s)]
*  fight our children, you'll fight our grandchildren. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=549.0999999999999s)]
*  He's not giving up. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=551.7399999999999s)]
*  But certainly they shouldn't have to do that fight. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=553.3s)]
*  So Bob, let's return to Argentina, which we've spoken about in the last month. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=556.28s)]
*  We discussed Argentina's first round presidential elections. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=560.28s)]
*  The results required a second runoff election and the center-left economy minister Sergio [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=564.04s)]
*  Massa, a man who was handing out money with wild abandon, and the libertarian populist [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=568.36s)]
*  Javier Millet, who of course seemed to be running against the pope and wants to shut down the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=574.6s)]
*  central bank. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=579.52s)]
*  And these two people are going to face off on Sunday. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=580.52s)]
*  Massa came out in the lead after the first round, but with the economy is hitting an [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=583.12s)]
*  annual inflation now of 143%. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=586.78s)]
*  Is he going to win? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=588.88s)]
*  Is Millet going to win? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=591.28s)]
*  Does the pope have a dog in this fight? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=592.28s)]
*  Those are all great questions, Carla, especially the last one. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=595.16s)]
*  If you look at the polls, which you always do first, they're showing basically dead [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=597.76s)]
*  heat if you take the cross-section of polls. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=601.24s)]
*  Millet is ahead in a couple of points in some and he trails or is almost even with Massa [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=603.68s)]
*  and others. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=608.24s)]
*  He looks to have secured the support of the person who pulled third in the first round, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=609.32s)]
*  Patricia Bullrich, who's a center-right politician. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=614.2s)]
*  After winning her over following some really critical crude comments about her early in [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=617.5200000000001s)]
*  the previous part of the campaign, Millet is known for that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=622.12s)]
*  He's also known for being able to try to smooth things over with grandiose language. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=625.34s)]
*  He is a phenomenon in this campaign and is being looked at closely if he does end up [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=630.24s)]
*  winning. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=635.2s)]
*  The reason he has a very solid chance of winning is just this disgust over the things you mentioned, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=636.32s)]
*  the state of the economy, 143% inflation. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  Remember how outraged Americans were when it hit 7% in June 2022. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=645.5600000000001s)]
*  Imagine having it at 143, what that does to your savings, to your prospects, to your children's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=650.2800000000001s)]
*  prospects. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=656.48s)]
*  People are frustrated, they're outraged at the system that has brought them to this point. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=657.48s)]
*  They had been outraged at the system that had been led by the Peronist movement, which [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=662.12s)]
*  is what Massa comes from. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=666.14s)]
*  And yet he's been able to parlay concerns and some of the longstanding support for the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=667.84s)]
*  Peronist candidate on his side because of concerns about Millet. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=672.76s)]
*  And so we're going to have to see how this plays out. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=676.48s)]
*  And as we enter into this final weekend of campaigning, we're seeing some telltale signs [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=679.48s)]
*  that we've seen in the past from populist candidates, in Millet in this case, fueling [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=684.44s)]
*  suspicions that there could be voter fraud if the vote doesn't go his way. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=688.38s)]
*  We saw that in Brazil. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=692.38s)]
*  We saw that here in the United States. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=693.38s)]
*  Let's keep an eye on the sort of comportment of the polling process in Argentina. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=695.08s)]
*  As we've said previously, through all of its economic travails, it has proven to be a resilient [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=700.6600000000001s)]
*  democracy, but its political governance is really, really challenged. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=705.98s)]
*  And again, it's got these epic figures, huge amounts out to the IMF. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=711.44s)]
*  It is looking at the prospect of a Millet presidency in which he would swap the peso [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=715.4200000000001s)]
*  for the US dollar. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=720.82s)]
*  A number of economic experts say it's just not feasible. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=721.82s)]
*  Others say, well, let's see what he's able to pull off and maybe a new territory economically. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=725.46s)]
*  Argentina has also innovated in economic gamesmanship in the past to get through its debt travails. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=730.5s)]
*  So we got a lot of new territory to look at ahead, even if Massa wins. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  So we've heard this a lot. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=740.38s)]
*  President Trump questioned the legitimacy of the US election long before it was held. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=742.9399999999999s)]
*  We heard this in Brazil. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=748.14s)]
*  It's more complicated in Argentina because of this weird way they do this, that the parties [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=749.54s)]
*  print their own ballot papers and then they have to send them to this oversight body to [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=754.4599999999999s)]
*  be distributed to polling stations. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=760.9399999999999s)]
*  And Millet's team has held back some of the ballot papers and they're going to distribute [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=763.3s)]
*  themselves. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=767.14s)]
*  And this seems like a recipe for disaster in terms of legitimacy of the election. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=768.14s)]
*  Are we barreling towards some real crisis? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=774.8199999999999s)]
*  Well that's the other new territory because again, we haven't seen this kind of sort of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=778.74s)]
*  crisis at the polls in Argentina amidst its other perils and its other challenges. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=783.42s)]
*  And they had a very rambunctious political landscape there for many years now. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=788.66s)]
*  And the Cristina Kirchner government was another case. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=793.1s)]
*  They've also had their many bouts of corruption to deal with. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=796.06s)]
*  And so it's not outside the bounds of possibility that we have some tampering that takes place [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=800.26s)]
*  with ballots and so forth. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=804.66s)]
*  I think we should be prepared for that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=806.0999999999999s)]
*  I think we should come in Monday prepared to deal with a new situation in Argentina [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=807.8199999999999s)]
*  unless we have some clear figures. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=813.3s)]
*  Let's say Millet wins outright by 4% or Massa is out so far ahead that Millet decides he's [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=814.9399999999999s)]
*  not going to challenge it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=820.54s)]
*  Otherwise if it's extremely, extremely close, that creates all sorts of openings for discovered [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=822.06s)]
*  votes or votes that were said to be disappeared. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=827.3s)]
*  And then you have the country's institutions having to step up like they did in Brazil [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=830.2399999999999s)]
*  by the way. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=833.7399999999999s)]
*  And Brazilians among others are watching this very closely. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=834.8199999999999s)]
*  They're concerned about language coming out of Millet. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=837.66s)]
*  And the Lula government did prevail against Bolsonaro just a year ago and faced their [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=840.56s)]
*  own sort of mini insurrection in their capital. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=845.9799999999999s)]
*  So this is something that major democracies are looking at and confronting and Argentina [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=849.26s)]
*  is no exception. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=853.86s)]
*  Just one final thing I think we should be watching here is that the Chinese have been [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=855.48s)]
*  really interested in Argentina. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=859.3s)]
*  They have this really intriguing project in the south of Argentina in which there's supposedly [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=861.88s)]
*  a satellite tracking station which may or may not be a satellite tracking station. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=867.66s)]
*  It may have more nefarious military uses for it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=872.22s)]
*  And Millet really, I mean, there's a lot of people he doesn't like. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=875.58s)]
*  But he really doesn't like the Chinese. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=878.74s)]
*  He's called China an assassin and he's not going to make deals with communist China and [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=880.1800000000001s)]
*  all of that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=884.14s)]
*  So we'll see if he were to win the Chinese hold Argentine paper. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=885.48s)]
*  The Chinese like to spread money around. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=890.46s)]
*  We'll see whether or not he changes his tune on this. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=892.34s)]
*  But if he were to keep his word, he could be trying to oust the Chinese from a place [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=894.54s)]
*  that they've been quite comfortable for quite a while. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=900.34s)]
*  It's a really good point Carla because of, as you say, what Millet has said, he has basically [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=902.54s)]
*  He said he won't make deals with communists in China or Brazil for that matter. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=906.7800000000001s)]
*  He said he will not join the BRICS, which Argentina was invited to join, the BRICS group, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=910.6600000000001s)]
*  which China has a member of and is touting increasingly as an alternative to groups like [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=914.62s)]
*  the Group of Seven. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=918.58s)]
*  But also one would imagine China would have to play some sort of supporting role in dealing [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=919.7800000000001s)]
*  with its debt problems. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=923.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean, for example, our colleague Brad Setzer is pointing out in an upcoming piece on CFR.org [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=924.7800000000001s)]
*  that the government currently in Argentina has had to make payments in Chinese yuan, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=929.58s)]
*  the external currency, when possible, because the China's central bank has been willing [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=934.5s)]
*  to let Argentina make more use of what's known as a standing swap line to exchange pesos [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=938.46s)]
*  for yuan. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=943.7s)]
*  China has helped Argentina sort of make book in ways that other countries wouldn't be so [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=944.94s)]
*  inclined to. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=949.1s)]
*  It's played an important role. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=950.1s)]
*  Obviously, there's leverage there as well. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=951.42s)]
*  And China sees Argentina as this important foothold in the region, but also a source [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=953.86s)]
*  of resources and everything else. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=957.72s)]
*  So there's a lot at stake in just that area alone. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=959.7s)]
*  Carla, let's bring it back to the European continent. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=963.46s)]
*  Tomorrow, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will arrive in Berlin to meet with [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=966.1800000000001s)]
*  the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=969.9s)]
*  Now there's likely to be discussions on refugee flows, Turkey's resistance to Sweden's NATO [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=971.94s)]
*  bid, although that appears to be moving its way through. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=976.54s)]
*  But the conversation looks to get most attention around the issue of Israel and the war in [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=980.9s)]
*  Gaza with Hamas. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=985.62s)]
*  Erdogan himself has now referred to the Israeli campaign as terrorism, very strong words. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=987.34s)]
*  Russians have been strong in their defense of Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=992.26s)]
*  So how productive will this meeting in Berlin be, you think? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=995.5s)]
*  This is sort of extraordinary. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=999.46s)]
*  I mean, we weren't even sure that it was going to go ahead, but Scholz decided to continue [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1000.46s)]
*  with it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1005.02s)]
*  Erdogan is a problematic NATO ally at the best of times. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1006.02s)]
*  He's an autocrat in an alliance of democracies. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1011.18s)]
*  He's been far too fond of Vladimir Putin and far too willing to buy technology for the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1014.3s)]
*  Russians for someone whose security is guaranteed by an Article 5 NATO commitment. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1020.02s)]
*  Remember we talked about this in September. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1025.98s)]
*  He told the Associated Press that he trusts Russia as much as he trusts the West. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1027.58s)]
*  So this guy's like part of the greatest military alliance in history, so he's a problematic [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1032.02s)]
*  ally. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1037.58s)]
*  And the thing that's of course driving everybody crazy right now, it's the thing you quoted [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1039.18s)]
*  from him, is that he has described Hamas after October 7th as liberators. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1043.18s)]
*  He accused Israel of committing crimes against humanity in Gaza. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1047.94s)]
*  He described the Israeli government as practicing fascism and genocide. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1051.14s)]
*  And on Wednesday this week, he reiterated that Israel is a terror state. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1056.74s)]
*  So this of course, you know, a great deal of disagreement about this and a great deal [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1061.14s)]
*  of pain involved. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1065.54s)]
*  We've talked about this extensively about what was going on in Gaza. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1067.74s)]
*  But this is obviously hugely out of step with what the Europeans believe and certainly hugely [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1071.8200000000002s)]
*  out of step with what Schultz and his government believes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1077.3s)]
*  They are very strong supporters of Israel. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1079.82s)]
*  And Germany, like the EU and the US, who designate Hamas as a terrorist group, and Schultz was [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1083.1399999999999s)]
*  the first head of government to visit Israel after the October 7th attacks. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1088.98s)]
*  So this is something that they are not in the same place about. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1092.4199999999998s)]
*  Schultz in particular called the accusations against Israel as absurd. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1096.54s)]
*  So how much they're going to publicly spar about this, I don't know. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1100.1399999999999s)]
*  I think they're obviously going to have to be dealt with in public in some way. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1105.02s)]
*  And Erdogan is not a guy who likes to be disagreed with in public. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1108.18s)]
*  So we'll see what it looks like there. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1111.02s)]
*  But they have a lot of other things to talk about. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1113.3s)]
*  And reportedly, you know, the people around Schultz weighed about whether or not to cancel [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1115.42s)]
*  and decided not to. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1118.8600000000001s)]
*  So what do they have to talk about? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1120.54s)]
*  You know, this question about Sweden's bid to join NATO. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1122.42s)]
*  It looked like Erdogan had made a commitment and he's finally submitted a bill recommending [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1125.02s)]
*  that Sweden be ratified as a NATO member. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1130.98s)]
*  But his parliament hasn't acted on it yet. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1135.0600000000002s)]
*  So that has got to be jollied ahead. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1137.38s)]
*  Other issues expected to be discussed are migration. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1140.0600000000002s)]
*  They of course famously had that, you know, migration deal. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1142.8200000000002s)]
*  A huge, huge number of migrants are in Turkey. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1145.8200000000002s)]
*  And I think the EU wants that to be always the backup state. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1149.3400000000001s)]
*  And they want to continue to move ahead with this. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1152.9s)]
*  I think they want to have this as a backer, potentially a new migration deal. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1155.6200000000001s)]
*  And he's there for that. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1160.02s)]
*  They also see him as a crisis mediator. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1161.7s)]
*  We remember the role that he played with the Black Sea grain deal. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1163.54s)]
*  And if there is a potential for the situation in the region aspiring that of control, it's [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1166.46s)]
*  really hard to imagine anybody who refers to Hamas as a liberator and calls Israel as [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1171.1s)]
*  a fascist state being able to be a mediator. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1176.02s)]
*  But somehow he manages to straddle these lines. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1178.18s)]
*  And so, you know, cultivating him perhaps for that is one of the other reasons why they're [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1181.3s)]
*  still talking to the guy. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1186.62s)]
*  And finally, Germany is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1188.82s)]
*  And with those millions of Turks inside of Germany, they have another reason. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1193.3400000000001s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons also why Erdogan will probably be not as in Schultz's face [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1197.14s)]
*  as he might be because those Turks that live in Germany vote in Turkey. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1201.74s)]
*  So there's a mutual interest there as well. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1206.8600000000001s)]
*  That last point is a particularly good one, Carla. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1209.46s)]
*  And I think partly due to that and other recent developments, Germany carries a bit more credibility [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1211.7s)]
*  on migrant issues in Europe than other countries do. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1217.38s)]
*  It absorbed, I believe, more than a million from the 2015 wave, many of them from Syria. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1220.98s)]
*  And obviously, Turkey itself is still hosting some more than three million Syrians on its [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1225.8600000000001s)]
*  territory. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1230.7s)]
*  So these are the important countries as it relates to migrant issues involving Europe. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1231.9s)]
*  And that's going to be a really big deal. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1237.5400000000002s)]
*  But again, it could even get overshadowed because of the passions running high over [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1239.18s)]
*  Israel and Gaza right now. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1243.8600000000001s)]
*  So it is a consequential visit. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1245.1000000000001s)]
*  I can see why it's taking place, but a lot of storylines to watch. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1247.74s)]
*  Well, I do think one of the reasons why I wanted to talk about this is that these divisions [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1251.22s)]
*  that exist, this is really a profound division among countries, among inside alliances, and [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1256.02s)]
*  it's profound divisions inside of countries. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1262.06s)]
*  You're seeing this in organizations. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1265.6200000000001s)]
*  You're seeing this on college campuses. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1266.8600000000001s)]
*  You're seeing the level of dissent even inside the United States government. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1269.02s)]
*  More than 500 US government employees sent a letter to President Biden calling for a [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1272.66s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1276.58s)]
*  This is dissent cable that's been circulating inside the State Department. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1277.98s)]
*  A thousand USAID employees signed a letter of dissent. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1281.3799999999999s)]
*  And these are not people who are just randomly protesting. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1285.46s)]
*  These are people who live in the world of foreign policy and national security who are [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1288.34s)]
*  writing things and with profound concern. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1291.82s)]
*  You're seeing this conflict really dividing families. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1295.3799999999999s)]
*  Thanksgiving is going to be a difficult conversation for people who care about national security [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1300.46s)]
*  and foreign policy and human rights. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1304.02s)]
*  This is a very hard time. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1306.34s)]
*  So if there's a disagreement among Schultz and Erdogan, it is a disagreement that's reflected [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1307.54s)]
*  among relationships all over the world right now. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1312.3799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1314.98s)]
*  And back to one of your points, Turkey, despite its harsh language, still potentially could [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1315.98s)]
*  play some brokering role due to its connections to Hamas among other things. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1321.74s)]
*  Whether or not that's an incremental one and it plays a role with negotiating hostage [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1326.4599999999998s)]
*  releases or whatever, it's not clear. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1329.98s)]
*  Qatar seems to be playing a bigger role at this point. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1331.6599999999999s)]
*  But still in all, it could be some of this rhetoric is designed to gain some leverage [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1334.18s)]
*  there. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1338.74s)]
*  But we're going to see some harsh language and looking at some navigation of tough divisions [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1340.0600000000002s)]
*  among allies. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1344.8s)]
*  And by the time that this drops, there may be a hostage release because there are reports [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1346.22s)]
*  that Hamas has agreed to this and the Americans, President Biden said he was deeply involved [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1351.18s)]
*  in this and that they're waiting to see which way the Israelis jump, whether or not that [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1355.8600000000001s)]
*  relieves some of the pressure or just brings a pause to it. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1361.18s)]
*  We'll have to see. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1364.9s)]
*  This is something that is moving ahead at quite a pace. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1365.9s)]
*  But these divisions, these profound divisions are not going to go away for quite a while. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1369.22s)]
*  So Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1373.98s)]
*  This is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1378.3400000000001s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1382.78s)]
*  And this week, Bob, our audience selected, well, he's not a guy who makes it on many [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1384.54s)]
*  lists of figures. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1388.82s)]
*  David Cameron returns to UK government. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1390.42s)]
*  How and why is the former prime minister back? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1393.5s)]
*  Well, it's a fascinating time at 10 Downing, to say the least. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1396.7s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of things going on, including damage control involving the top [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1402.54s)]
*  cabinet ministers in the government. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1408.38s)]
*  And it starts with the figure of Suella Braberman, the Home Secretary, who has been known for [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1410.5s)]
*  her caustic comments about any number of things. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1416.1200000000001s)]
*  But most recently, it was about people taking part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1418.76s)]
*  She called them mobs. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1423.32s)]
*  She called them hate marches. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1424.32s)]
*  She published an op-ed that was apparently not approved by the government that included [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1425.72s)]
*  such strong language. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1429.84s)]
*  And it was seen as time for her to go. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1431.74s)]
*  And for her to go, she'd be replaced by the foreign secretary at the time, James Cleverly. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1434.12s)]
*  And that meant that he needed to be replaced. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1438.52s)]
*  And it was sort of a statement assignment for David Cameron to come back into the fold. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  He's not from the typical spot that a foreign secretary would be chosen from, which would [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1445.8s)]
*  be the House of Commons. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1449.72s)]
*  He's from the House of Lords, actually. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1450.72s)]
*  That's kind of uncommon to see appear. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1452.28s)]
*  They actually put him into the House of Lords to give him the slot in the first place. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1453.76s)]
*  I mean, this is sort of unheard of. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1457.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, they created the gig for him. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1459.36s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think it does a number of things. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1462.9199999999998s)]
*  There's been all sorts of interesting commentary on it. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1464.48s)]
*  As the Financial Times says, Cameron brings experience and baggage as he returns to politics. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1466.36s)]
*  The experience is undeniable. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1471.04s)]
*  He knows a lot of the major leaders of the world who are still in power and knows them [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1472.72s)]
*  well enough to be able to maybe cut through some tangles, some diplomatic tangles that [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1477.1599999999999s)]
*  might be necessary at this moment of two major global wars playing out and a lot of frictions [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1481.04s)]
*  going on, big power frictions. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  But he also brings the baggage of what a number of people have said is the worst policy disaster [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1488.72s)]
*  in modern UK history, which is the Brexit referendum. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1493.56s)]
*  And the vote against staying in the European Union occasioned him to leave government shortly [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1496.78s)]
*  after that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1501.16s)]
*  And you've seen a succession of some rocky governments in the UK. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1502.16s)]
*  So Cameron comes back as someone who is on the one hand a calm hand in government and [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1506.3600000000001s)]
*  also has this baggage. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1511.4s)]
*  Soon after he was brought back in, there was a really important ruling that took place [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1513.6000000000001s)]
*  that also shook the Sunni government, which was striking down its 2022 immigration law [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1516.8600000000001s)]
*  that was sending asylum seekers to Rwanda. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1521.48s)]
*  This is a UK Supreme Court ruling. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1523.88s)]
*  And so the government's very unhappy with it, still vowing to put up a wall against [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1525.68s)]
*  what it sees as an invasion of refugees and so forth. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1530.44s)]
*  But it's a government that's kind of looking for answers and looking for a calm month of [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1533.44s)]
*  news to kind of help steer it into a very difficult electoral year when it's facing [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1538.6000000000001s)]
*  a strong challenge from labor. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1543.72s)]
*  Cameron, interestingly enough, is a much more centrist conservative than the Sunni government [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1545.88s)]
*  is. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  He was much more pro-social reform. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1554.3600000000001s)]
*  He was much more of a green guy. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1555.3600000000001s)]
*  He obviously was, you know, careful with the idea that he opened the door to this referendum, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1558.52s)]
*  which he did not want. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1563.48s)]
*  He was very much a remain person. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1565.28s)]
*  But one wonders what Sunak was thinking. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1567.9199999999998s)]
*  Maybe he is tacking more center with this. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1571.1999999999998s)]
*  You can't imagine anybody who's more different from the person who left, from Suella. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1574.4399999999998s)]
*  And he certainly, as they like to say, has hit the ground running because what did he [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1580.9199999999998s)]
*  do? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1584.48s)]
*  He immediately went off to Ukraine to meet with Zelensky. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1585.48s)]
*  So it looks like a very calming presence, as you said. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1588.56s)]
*  And I'm not sure it's going to help their electoral prospects very much. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1592.24s)]
*  But at a period of time in which the United States is struggling with its own commitment [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1597.08s)]
*  to Ukraine, it was sort of nice to see Cameron off there. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1600.6s)]
*  It was a name, as you said, a name we're not used to seeing in the news by any chance. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1603.3600000000001s)]
*  And the fact that we're going to end the year. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1608.1200000000001s)]
*  Not going to be on the cover of People magazine. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1609.6s)]
*  No. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1611.6s)]
*  And the fact we're going to end the year where we might see his name popping up quite a bit [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1612.68s)]
*  is very interesting. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1615.48s)]
*  One other note that some people have pointed to, some people who watch the UK closely, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1616.8600000000001s)]
*  is that he's not seen as a threat to Sunak himself. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1620.68s)]
*  There might have been many other close members of cabinet who would eagerly jump at the leadership [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1623.04s)]
*  position, but Cameron himself was out of the fray. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1627.72s)]
*  Didn't seem to be someone who was clamoring to get back into the top position and had [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1630.8s)]
*  been a longtime career politician prior as well. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1634.76s)]
*  But is coming back to be able to play this particular role that he could be very well [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1638.28s)]
*  suited for. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1642.52s)]
*  And that's our look at the roiling world next week. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwPAUdz8ho&t=1644.24s)]
