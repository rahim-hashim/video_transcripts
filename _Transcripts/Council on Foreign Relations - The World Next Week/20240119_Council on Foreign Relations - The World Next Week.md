# U.S.-Iran Proxy War Intensifies, Sudan Conflict Rages On, Sundance Film Festival, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8)
*  In the coming week, the proxy war between Iran and the United States intensifies. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=0.0s)]
*  Sudan's conflict suffers another diplomatic setback, and the year's first big movie event, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=5.44s)]
*  the Sundance Film Festival, takes place. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=10.0s)]
*  It's January 18, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=12.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=21.36s)]
*  Carly, we're going to have to start in the Middle East again, as looks like it will be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=29.92s)]
*  the pattern for the year. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  We are more than 100 days now into the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Fears of a region-wide spread of conflict continue to grow. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=40.2s)]
*  U.S. forces have maintained attacks on Iran-aligned Houthis based in Yemen, and U.S. officials [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=43.52s)]
*  recently found evidence that implicates Iran in supplying Houthis with weaponry. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=48.52s)]
*  This is only going to add to the tensions between the United States and Iran in and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  around the region. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=57.44s)]
*  So Carly, can you give us a sense of what we know about Iran's involvement in the potentially [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=58.72s)]
*  widening war? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  This proxy war between Iran and the U.S. and its allies has been going on for years, as [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=64.24s)]
*  you know, Bob. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  And Iran, of course, is the main backer of Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  It also backs the Houthis in Yemen, as well as Iranian-linked groups, which have been [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=75.28s)]
*  targeting U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=79.16s)]
*  But the fighting has gotten a lot more intense since the start of the Gaza war. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=82.24s)]
*  At the same time, you know, all sides look like they are trying to avoid a direct confrontation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=86.04s)]
*  It's also not clear that that's possible to avoid, especially in a multi-front war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=91.36s)]
*  And this really is a multi-front war and a time when passions are so intense. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=95.12s)]
*  And adding to the tensions, and this really is a surprise, in the last few days, the Iranian [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=99.84s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard has gotten directly involved. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=103.72s)]
*  They've launched missiles against sites in Syria, in Pakistan, in Iraq. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=106.28s)]
*  And these are all countries with which it's somewhat allied. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=110.56s)]
*  And these, it said, were retaliation for recent terrorist attacks inside of Iran that killed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=113.2s)]
*  11 security personnel in Sistan, Balochistan in December. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  And you remember that terrible attack at a memorial march that killed 82 people this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=122.72s)]
*  month. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, these countries are allies, varying degrees of warrants. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=128.76s)]
*  The Iraqis and Pakistanis in particular were not happy, and Pakistan hit back. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=132.04s)]
*  At the same time, Pakistan itself referred to Iran as a brotherly country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  So I think everybody wants to avoid it spinning out of control. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=140.0s)]
*  But it is spinning. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=143.96s)]
*  So all of this is proxy words and a little bit of a direct war that is beginning there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=145.4s)]
*  So the proxies that are getting the most attention, as you mentioned, are the Houthis. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=150.88s)]
*  They've launched some three dozen attacks since November on shipping in the Red Sea, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=154.6s)]
*  saying they're acting in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=158.96s)]
*  And starting last week, the Brits and the Americans began hitting Houthi military sites. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=162.84s)]
*  I think there have been some 60 hits so far against missile launchers, air defenses, depots [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=166.48s)]
*  where they store missiles and drones, a few command centers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=171.32s)]
*  But the Houthis appear undaunted. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=175.12s)]
*  In the last few days, they've hit a Greek-owned commercial ship and two U.S. commercial ships. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=176.48s)]
*  In all three cases, no one is hurt, and the damage is reported to be limited. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=181.88s)]
*  But for all of the hitting back, Houthis don't seem like they want to stop. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=186.34s)]
*  Iran definitely involved missiles are very expensive. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=192.68s)]
*  Missiles are cheap, but missiles are expensive. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=195.32s)]
*  And Yemen is a very poor country, so the Houthis couldn't be doing this without Iranian support. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=197.48s)]
*  And late Thursday last week, the U.S. Navy SEALs boarded a sailing ship off the coast [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=202.16s)]
*  of Somalia. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=206.4s)]
*  And according to the Pentagon, they seized components for Iranian-made cruise and ballistic [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=207.64s)]
*  missiles, which were bound for the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=210.88s)]
*  And tragically, two SEALs are missing after the operation, but it's pretty strong proof [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=213.72s)]
*  of what Iran is doing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=218.32s)]
*  So there's a ton going on there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=220.44s)]
*  As you were talking, I'm thinking about if there was a heat map of the area, you'd see [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=222.48s)]
*  throbbing red all over the place. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=225.68s)]
*  It's just getting worse and worse. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=227.84s)]
*  But let's maybe start with the Houthis. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=229.36s)]
*  They dealt with a good amount of attacks from the Saudis in recent years, and it seemed [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=231.6s)]
*  like they shrugged that off pretty successfully. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  The Saudis, by the way, are using, in many cases, U.S. armaments to try to attack the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=238.68s)]
*  Houthis. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=242.68s)]
*  They have this lock on this one part of Yemen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=243.68s)]
*  So is the U.S. going to be content to continue to be attacking from afar? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=246.7s)]
*  Is it going to have to ramp things up against them just in the Houthi front? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=250.84s)]
*  Are you seeing any signs of that? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=254.04s)]
*  Well, you know, the U.S. held off for a long time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=255.6s)]
*  I mean, I think they've got multiple equities here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=259.92s)]
*  Nobody really wants to make the situation inside of Yemen worse. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=263.12s)]
*  One of the reasons why the Biden administration took the Houthis off of the terrorist list, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=266.92s)]
*  which they've now put them back on, but not as intensely, was because they wanted to be [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=272.08s)]
*  able to get aid inside of Yemen, and nobody wants to make the situation in Yemen even [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=277.32s)]
*  worse. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=281.48s)]
*  At the same time, what the Houthis are doing is really messing up the global supply chains. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=282.48s)]
*  So there's a lot of equities involved there, and the Houthis seem completely undeterrable. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=287.44s)]
*  But missiles are very expensive, as I said, and they won't have an infinite number of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=293.68s)]
*  them. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=298.68s)]
*  And if you can stop the source, if you can stop the Iranians from shipping them, maybe [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=299.68s)]
*  pressure on Iran in other ways. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  Drones are cheap, and the Houthis apparently have a capability of putting them together [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=306.85999999999996s)]
*  themselves, getting components from the Chinese and other places. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=310.73999999999995s)]
*  So whether this is going to be a cat and mouse game or a bigger fight, you know, we'll just [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=314.02s)]
*  have to watch and see. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=318.26s)]
*  I wonder how much the Iranians can sustain this, because as you're saying, you know, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=320.29999999999995s)]
*  there seems to be a desire to not escalate. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=324.85999999999996s)]
*  Certainly their sway over Hezbollah seems to be such that Hezbollah is not going to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=328.38s)]
*  escalate in response to some recent Israeli attacks in Lebanon. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=333.74s)]
*  But there's these supplies to the Houthis, and then there's the Iranians reacting to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=338.06s)]
*  attacks on their own soil. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  It just seems like they've got some problems on their own in terms of who's calling the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=344.9s)]
*  shots and who's able to kind of direct things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=348.82s)]
*  But they're not necessarily the puppet master that we have in previous years thought of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=351.82s)]
*  the Iranian as being in the region, at least. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=355.7s)]
*  Well, I think they have different levels of relationships and different levels of control. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm not an expert in these relationships, but the things I've read and the things I've [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=363.54s)]
*  heard is that they have really limited control with the Houthis and much more direct [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=367.34s)]
*  relationship with Hezbollah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=372.26s)]
*  But U.S. officials believe that not only are the Iranians supplying missiles, but the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=374.02s)]
*  Iranian ships and aircraft are giving targeting data to the Houthis. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=378.54s)]
*  These are things that they could cut off even if they may not be able to persuade them to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=381.58s)]
*  stop doing what they're doing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=385.34s)]
*  So it seems like there's more of a choke point. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=386.58s)]
*  These attacks in Pakistan and Iraq and in Syria, these are things that are separate. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=389.42s)]
*  This is a response to terrorist attacks that have taken place inside of Iran that happened [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=394.26s)]
*  to be taking place at the same time, but I think are quite separate from the Gaza War. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=399.26s)]
*  And I think they, if anything, give the Iranians more of an incentive to try to crank things [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=403.82s)]
*  back in other places. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=408.26s)]
*  Certainly, they have hit back hard because to send to their own hardliners messages or [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=409.7s)]
*  their own hardliners domestically and to send messages internationally. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=415.06s)]
*  We have strong missiles. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=418.92s)]
*  We are a strong country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=419.92s)]
*  We're not going to put up with this. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=420.92s)]
*  At the same time, stability is all for them domestically. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  They don't want to show any weakness, but they also don't want things to spin any more [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=425.24s)]
*  out of control. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=428.12s)]
*  They haven't forgotten that there were demonstrations on the street. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=429.36s)]
*  They haven't forgotten that they have a very weak economy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=431.88s)]
*  So they are also, you know, walking, to use a cliche, they're walking a very tough tightrope here. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  And meanwhile, the core of the fighting is in Gaza. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=441.0s)]
*  Some signs that the Israelis may be drawing down some of their forces. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=444.1s)]
*  And you heard some new language from the US administration in Davos this week about, you [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=448.0s)]
*  know, reiterating call for a two-state solution. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=452.12s)]
*  Are we getting any sense that the US is trying to kind of bring together countries in the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=454.2s)]
*  region to try to build some momentum on that front, let's say, at some sort of an effort [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=458.76s)]
*  with involving the Arab world and helping to kind of usher into a post-Gaza war phase? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=463.24s)]
*  Or is that just too remote a prospect? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=469.2s)]
*  Certainly what the administration would like, but I think as long as the reality of the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=472.44s)]
*  horrors of what's going on in Gaza continue, and certainly the US seems to have minimal [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=475.96s)]
*  influence, if any and all, with the Netanyahu government. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=481.56s)]
*  I mean, until this war winds down or ends, I just don't see a lot of progress there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=484.2s)]
*  And I find it really hard to imagine there's going to be any progress as long as Netanyahu [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=490.35999999999996s)]
*  states are in charge of Israel. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=494.12s)]
*  So that's probably not a reality that the administration wants to voice out loud, but [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=496.08s)]
*  I suspect it's a reality they know. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=500.44s)]
*  And meanwhile, one of the other subplots going on is that Hamas still holds a number [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=502.84s)]
*  of hostages, more than 100 at this point. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=507.08s)]
*  And it's not clear whether there's any sort of process that is going to get more of them [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=510.2s)]
*  released anytime soon. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=513.72s)]
*  There was some progress this week, supposedly, to get more aid in, not to help hostages supposedly, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  but there doesn't seem to be any progress at all on this question of releasing hostages, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=521.76s)]
*  which is also an essential domestic issue for Netanyahu. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=525.6s)]
*  As much as they talk about moving things back, pulling people out, supposedly responding [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=530.0400000000001s)]
*  to what the Americans are saying, more targeted form of war, they're going to go after leaders [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=535.64s)]
*  and not the general population. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=540.12s)]
*  You still have these thousands and thousands of people who've been killed and all of these [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=541.84s)]
*  people who've been displaced in a terrible, terrible humanitarian situation and the constant [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=545.84s)]
*  warning of famine inside of Gaza. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=551.12s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=553.4000000000001s)]
*  Very hard to talk about a two-state solution when the horror of what's unfolding in Gaza [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=554.4000000000001s)]
*  is continuing. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=558.6s)]
*  And I should note, we just published on our website a primer on the Palestinian governance [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=560.76s)]
*  issue such as it is right now and how complicated a thicket that is and was before October 7th [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=564.96s)]
*  and really raising questions about what sort of Palestinian entity could possibly emerge [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  in any sort of timeframe that lessens the tensions in the area. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, listen, responsible statecraft, one would hope that the State Department and the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=580.76s)]
*  is thinking about what happens afterwards and considering what governance is going to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=586.1999999999999s)]
*  look like afterwards. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=590.7199999999999s)]
*  It would be irresponsible not to do it, but I think the reality of it is that the war [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=591.7199999999999s)]
*  has to end. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=595.56s)]
*  So Bob, let's shift to what I would hope would be a happier topic, but it's not. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=597.0s)]
*  Let's shift to Sudan and the conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=602.4s)]
*  Forces, the SAF and the RSF, which began in April of last year, entered its ninth month [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=606.92s)]
*  on Monday. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=613.64s)]
*  And more than 7.4 million Sudanese people have been displaced since this fighting began. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=615.2s)]
*  About 25 million people, 14 million of whom are children, are in desperate need of humanitarian [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=619.88s)]
*  assistance. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=626.12s)]
*  Is anything being done to mitigate this crisis? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=627.12s)]
*  And can Sudanese people turn to anybody for help? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=630.64s)]
*  Well, we had entered this year with some little glimmer of potentially diplomatic momentum, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=633.8s)]
*  In fact, today, Thursday, was supposed to be a day for a new round of diplomacy convened [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=640.6s)]
*  by this regional group in East Africa known as EGAD, I-G-A-D, that was going to bring [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=645.96s)]
*  together the heads of the two warring sides, the leader of the RSF or the Rapid Support [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  Forces known as Hemeti, as well as General Al-Burhan, who heads up the military-led vestiges [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=656.92s)]
*  of the government in Sudan. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=663.08s)]
*  But the government, the foreign ministry that is under the sway of the military stepped [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=664.96s)]
*  up just a few days ago and said, this cannot happen. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=669.0s)]
*  This is a violation of the sovereignty of Sudan to even invite this dangerous leader [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=672.12s)]
*  of the RSF. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=679.0s)]
*  And so it seemed to have been an effort towards getting the principal two protagonists in [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=680.76s)]
*  the room together with a regional body convening talks on it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=684.6800000000001s)]
*  First of all, a ceasefire and then some sort of path and some sort of off ramp to the fighting [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=689.2800000000001s)]
*  has instead devolved. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=693.52s)]
*  We're left with a situation in which Sudan gets worse and worse. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=695.6s)]
*  And what a number of watchers of Sudan have said is that first of all, back to your question, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=699.24s)]
*  Carla, there's a problem of neglect going on. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=704.0s)]
*  And let's face it, with the Middle East alone, what you were just talking about, that's occupying [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=706.88s)]
*  full tilt a lot of certainly major powers as well as countries in the region. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=710.92s)]
*  But Sudan is, for the reasons you cited and the numbers you cited, is bad and getting [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=715.64s)]
*  much, much worse. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=720.48s)]
*  So 600,000 people just in the past month have been displaced. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=721.6s)]
*  And that adds to overall figures of 7.4 million displaced, which is a good 6 million of those [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=725.76s)]
*  are within the country. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  Almost one and a half million have fled the country. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=733.24s)]
*  That has regional impacts, obviously. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=736.0s)]
*  Very precarious humanitarian situation and a growing sense of lawlessness in the country. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=738.48s)]
*  The RSF forces have been steadily advancing, actually. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=743.28s)]
*  There was a thought that Sudan might settle into a Libya type situation where you have [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=746.6800000000001s)]
*  this regional division of almost half the country and it's a bit of a stalemate and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  then things kind of muddle ahead. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=755.52s)]
*  But in fact, the RSF forces are gaining ground. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=757.36s)]
*  They captured, in the last several weeks, the second largest city in the country after [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=760.28s)]
*  Khartoum. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=764.36s)]
*  That's in the eastern part of the country, which had been under the sway of the military. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  The eastern and central part of the country is where most of the food is grown in Sudan. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=769.6s)]
*  Further raising alarm about what's going on there, the RSF forces have this pattern of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=773.88s)]
*  when they take over an area, they practice sort of the longstanding raping and pillaging, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=777.96s)]
*  literally, that we've seen through the ages. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=783.0s)]
*  There's ethnic cleansing that goes on and the thought of the RSF gaining a sway over [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=786.0s)]
*  most of the country really sends chills through Sudanese because they have antagonized the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=789.6s)]
*  population. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=794.0400000000001s)]
*  It's hard to imagine them running it, even sort of Taliban style. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=795.1600000000001s)]
*  And so it's not clear, like, what are the options here? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=799.0s)]
*  The peace process I mentioned through this Intergovernmental Authority on Development, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=802.44s)]
*  or IGED, that again was seen as this new effort in addition to what had been the Saudi US [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=806.4399999999999s)]
*  effort known as the JEDA process to try to get something going. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=811.9599999999999s)]
*  You have to have the principals willing to step up and sit down and talk and agree on [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=816.68s)]
*  an agenda for starters. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=821.92s)]
*  That's not happening. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=823.76s)]
*  And the humanitarian situation gets worse. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=825.24s)]
*  The UN says a pittance of its humanitarian appeal for Sudan has been answered so far. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  And so this is a country facing severe food shortages, if not famine. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=832.8399999999999s)]
*  It's got a population in flight. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=837.3199999999999s)]
*  It's got a population preyed upon by combatants. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=838.8s)]
*  And it's got a world preoccupied with other matters that's not spending enough time focusing [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=841.8399999999999s)]
*  on it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=847.28s)]
*  Our colleague Michelle Gavin had posted about not only is the Sudan situation devolving and [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=848.28s)]
*  requiring more attention, but Eastern Africa in general is in a bad way right now. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  You have unexpected new tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia over an Ethiopian move to work [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=857.5200000000001s)]
*  with the breakaway Somaliland region for coastal access. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=863.88s)]
*  And so the problems go on and on and the solutions seem to be few and the will to kind of reach [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=867.9200000000001s)]
*  an agreement seems to be receding. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=874.2s)]
*  So it's a large chunk of Eastern Africa. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=876.6s)]
*  Sudan, let's not forget, also borders the Red Sea, which we had just spoken about. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=879.08s)]
*  And so Port Sudan is still under the control of the government forces, the military forces, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=883.5s)]
*  I should say. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=888.5s)]
*  But it's not clear how much longer that's going to be the case as well. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=889.58s)]
*  So not a lot of options at the moment other than some sort of international pressure to [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=893.14s)]
*  try to open up humanitarian corridors, Carla. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=898.3s)]
*  So what international pressure is there? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=902.02s)]
*  There have been US efforts to sanction chief officials involved in the conflict. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=905.3s)]
*  Sudan's only go so far as we know, as we've talked about in many other contexts as well. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=910.54s)]
*  Again, our colleague Michelle Gavin has pointed to the fact that United Arab Emirates, which [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=915.02s)]
*  is a prime backer of the RSF forces, really needs to be called to account for its role [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=918.42s)]
*  in Sudan, for really sustaining this and playing basically what she says is a malign role in [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=923.66s)]
*  this also. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=929.5s)]
*  Maybe it's influencing the influencers in this case, maybe the US working on the UAE [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=930.9399999999999s)]
*  in some way to lessen its support. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=936.54s)]
*  It's not clear to what extent and to what leverage the US has in that regard, but there [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=939.18s)]
*  seems to be a sense that the US can do more and it has an official that's in the region [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=943.4599999999999s)]
*  that's been trying to work diplomatic angles. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=947.54s)]
*  But the diplomatic angles aren't going anywhere and it seems like more leverage is needed [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=950.14s)]
*  to come to bear. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=954.18s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=955.18s)]
*  That sanctions tends to be the first option and a little bit of military show of force. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=956.38s)]
*  The military is dealing with a few other things in the Red Sea at the moment. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=960.7399999999999s)]
*  So not for today, but I think we clearly need to take a closer look at the role the UAE [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=965.16s)]
*  is playing in all these different conflicts because every time you look around, there [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  they are, we're either condemning them or relying on them. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=974.92s)]
*  And their role is quite confusing to me. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=978.12s)]
*  So let's mark that as something that we should be digging into. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=980.48s)]
*  It bears closer look, certainly Carla. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=984.8199999999999s)]
*  Carla, I will be moving us onto a lighter topic, however, in the week ahead, because [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=987.0799999999999s)]
*  As listeners might know, you and I have a thing for films and film festivals and international [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=991.84s)]
*  films. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=997.84s)]
*  And lo and behold, the Sundance Film Festival is going to be marking its 40th anniversary, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=998.84s)]
*  which really is remarkable. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1003.16s)]
*  I recall there was this thing that used to happen and Robert Redford would invite a few [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1004.72s)]
*  friends and they'd show some movies and the Rockies and a few thousand friends, a few [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1008.08s)]
*  thousand of his closest friends. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1012.4s)]
*  And you'd get some indie movies would emerge from it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1014.52s)]
*  And it's had remarkable staying power. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1016.68s)]
*  It's become a very important festival, Carla. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1018.3s)]
*  Can you tell us what sort of films we need to be looking out for at this point in time, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1020.36s)]
*  2024? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  So this is billed as the largest independent film festival in the U.S. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1026.3600000000001s)]
*  So independence, a relative term. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1030.3600000000001s)]
*  It's filled with Hollywood insiders there along with newcomers vying for insider attention. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1032.3600000000001s)]
*  And the name of course, is after Robert Redford's character in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1038.0s)]
*  Kid. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1042.2s)]
*  Redford has been the sponsor from the beginning as well, along with his Sundance Institute. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1043.2s)]
*  And then in that time, it's brought attention to a lot of what were small films that made [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1047.6s)]
*  it big, like looked at the list and just pulled out some of the ones that really I like. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  Garden State, American Psycho, El Mariachi, Sex, Lies and Videotape, Little Miss Sunshine, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1056.24s)]
*  Thank You for Smoking, Napoleon Dynamite and Whiplash, which was voted number one in the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1061.48s)]
*  festival's list of top 10 films that made it big there. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1067.0s)]
*  This is going to be the first in-person festival since the start of the pandemic. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1070.1599999999999s)]
*  There's also going to be online showing of most, but not all of the films. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1073.88s)]
*  And there are a host of differing must watch lists out there, which we have been pouring [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1077.96s)]
*  over. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1081.88s)]
*  And sometimes this gig really is fun for us. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1082.88s)]
*  So let's start with the foreign films and competition because we're supposed to be looking [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1085.1200000000001s)]
*  at foreign things in this podcast. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1088.6000000000001s)]
*  Brief History of a Family. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1091.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't know a lot about Chinese moviemaking, so that drew my attention. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  at the post one child policy China and a family takes in their single son, they only have [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1098.48s)]
*  one child, new friend to whom he quote, feels a mysterious energetic pull and hidden family [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1105.16s)]
*  tension surface. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1110.56s)]
*  Couldn't find a trailer for that. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1112.1200000000001s)]
*  So that's all I could see about it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1113.2s)]
*  But as I said, I'm intrigued by the idea of Chinese cinema. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1114.76s)]
*  There's something called Suho, which is the story of the son of a Mexican cartel hitman [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1118.3600000000001s)]
*  who was orphaned at the age of four. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1122.4s)]
*  It looks at all the different stages of his life and raises the question of whether he [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1125.36s)]
*  can escape his own father's violent destiny. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1129.48s)]
*  And then there's Saoirse Ronan, who is something called the Outrun. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1133.68s)]
*  She plays a recovering alcoholic who comes home to the Orkney Islands and attempt to [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1136.6399999999999s)]
*  get herself back together. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1141.0s)]
*  And Ronan's last movie at Sundance was Brooklyn, which won her an Oscar the following year. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1142.96s)]
*  So I've watched Saoirse Ronan in pretty much anything. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1147.92s)]
*  So I think on the list of that, oh yeah, there's one more. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1151.08s)]
*  I am a Nordic noir freak. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1154.36s)]
*  So I might sign on to this, although I did find a trailer for this one and it really [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1156.84s)]
*  looks creepy and that's called Handling the Undead. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1160.48s)]
*  It's a Norwegian movie. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1163.48s)]
*  So Nordic noir that looks creepy, Carla? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1165.0s)]
*  I'm shocked. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1167.2s)]
*  I'm shocked. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1168.2s)]
*  This is even creepier. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1169.4399999999998s)]
*  And this tells the story of three families with recently deceased members who suddenly [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1171.36s)]
*  return to life. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1175.32s)]
*  And it stars Renate Rensby and Anders Danielsen-Lee from The Worst Person in the World. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1177.6799999999998s)]
*  So those are the ones that sort of drew my attention. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1184.1200000000001s)]
*  On the domestic front, there's one very strange one that's getting a lot of buzz, something [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1186.1200000000001s)]
*  called Love Me. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1191.08s)]
*  This is a sci-fi film and it's about a satellite and a buoy who long after humans have gone [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1192.08s)]
*  extinct meet online and fall in love over web data, social media and online videos. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1197.56s)]
*  And the satellite, I believe, is played by Kristen Stewart. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1204.84s)]
*  So she's always an indie favorite. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1208.76s)]
*  There's also something called Exhibiting Forgiveness, which is directed by the painter [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1211.52s)]
*  Titus Kaffar. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1215.68s)]
*  And it's a story about a black artist whose life threatens to be completely knocked off [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1217.16s)]
*  course by the arrival of his father, who's a recovering addict who wants to reconcile. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1220.8799999999999s)]
*  This has a hugely strong cast. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1225.2s)]
*  It's got Andre Holland, who played Kevin in Moonlight, and Andrew Day, the Arabian soul [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1226.72s)]
*  singer, and Anjanu Ellis-Taylor from When They See Us in Lovecraft Country. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1231.12s)]
*  So just for the cast itself, as well as this extraordinary painter Titus Kaffar in his [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1236.76s)]
*  first feature film direction that looks like one that definitely I want to see. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1241.82s)]
*  You know, A Real Pain, which is also in the U.S. dramatic competition, which is directed [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1247.28s)]
*  by Jesse Eisenberg. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1252.2s)]
*  And it also stars, along with Eisenberg, Kieran Culkin of Succession fame. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1253.56s)]
*  And the two of them play mismatched cousins who take a road trip across Poland to explore [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1258.08s)]
*  the history of their family, which fled Europe to escape the Holocaust. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1261.86s)]
*  To a certain extent, it does track Jesse Eisenberg's family, and it bills itself as [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1265.28s)]
*  both a comedy and a drama, which seems like a very challenging balance given the topic. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1269.8799999999999s)]
*  And finally, there's a documentary going to my Argentine fascination called Gaucho Gaucho. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1274.3999999999999s)]
*  And it's a documentary of Argentinian cowboys and cowgirls, which I think I'm probably going [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1279.68s)]
*  to want to see. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1284.76s)]
*  Wow, that's quite a lineup. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1285.76s)]
*  Definitely piqued my interest. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1287.6s)]
*  Also, I'm struck by, you know, as we continue to dig in every week on the perilous geopolitical [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1288.6s)]
*  and democratic moment that we're all in, these are real departures. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1294.2s)]
*  These are real like ways of sort of taking yourself off the grid and just getting caught [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1298.28s)]
*  up in things, as you say, like Nordic Noir, family dramas from China or other kind of [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1302.08s)]
*  personal tales. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1306.72s)]
*  It's an interesting rundown. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1307.72s)]
*  It's an interesting cross-section of sort of experiences to kind of get lost in, which [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1308.72s)]
*  also matter, obviously, in life, but tends to get lost in the midst of all the geopolitics [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1312.76s)]
*  and war and everything. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1317.28s)]
*  Well, I will say that there are no rom-coms on this list here. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1318.28s)]
*  No Barbie either, but it is exciting to see just the variety of things that are brought. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1322.72s)]
*  And you do know that everybody's going to be out there in Utah making big deals while [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1328.8s)]
*  dressed in their, you know, do people still wear fur? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1333.28s)]
*  Faux fur, Carla, faux fur. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1336.32s)]
*  Out there making their deals. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1338.04s)]
*  So Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1339.8s)]
*  And this is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1344.76s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  And this week, our audience selected 11 nations recognize Taiwan while Nauru cuts ties. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1350.66s)]
*  Why did Nauru bail? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1356.98s)]
*  And does it matter that Taiwan now only has official relations with 11 countries around [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1358.5400000000002s)]
*  the world? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1362.46s)]
*  Yes, and somewhat. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1363.46s)]
*  We should note that when last we discussed Taiwan, we were talking ahead of the elections, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1365.46s)]
*  which went off successfully. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1370.02s)]
*  More than 70% turnout, which is really strong and puts countries like the US to shame in [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1371.78s)]
*  terms of our typical turnout. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1375.98s)]
*  But also it was, as we discussed, it was a robust three person race for president. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1378.02s)]
*  There was also legislative races. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1381.74s)]
*  And William Lai, as expected, won. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1383.86s)]
*  And while his party was not able to achieve a majority, it's going to have to work with [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1386.18s)]
*  other parties to sort of pass some tough policies and things, which is in itself a balancing [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1390.82s)]
*  for the country. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1395.94s)]
*  China was still pretty alarmed at the result and took, I think, Great Solace and Nauru's [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1396.94s)]
*  decision to unrecognize Taiwan. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1401.3s)]
*  This is part of an ongoing effort by China to pick off all of the countries that recognize [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1404.9s)]
*  Taiwan and in so doing, once and for all, completely isolate Taiwan and continue what [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1409.5800000000002s)]
*  it hopes is an inevitable and inexorable path towards unification with the mainland. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1414.98s)]
*  China's response has been somewhat guarded since the results, but it was quick to lash [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1420.38s)]
*  out at countries that were supportive of Taiwan, including the US, which in its response stressed [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1424.24s)]
*  it did not recognize Taiwanese independence, but nonetheless congratulated Mr. Lai on his [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1429.9s)]
*  victory. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1434.22s)]
*  But also you had, as our colleague Josh Kerlenkirk pointed out on CFR.org, you had countries [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1435.3s)]
*  like Japan and the Philippines with pretty strong, robust notes of congratulations to [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1439.22s)]
*  the DPP candidate for winning, which brought an immediate rebuke from Beijing and again [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1444.18s)]
*  pointed out the concern that China has over any sort of consideration of Taiwan as this [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1449.82s)]
*  separate entity, especially a thriving democratic separate entity so close to the mainland. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1455.06s)]
*  Just the last couple of days, the first major Chinese military activity took place. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1461.54s)]
*  Taiwan's officials said that something like 18 Chinese Air Force planes operating around [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1465.74s)]
*  Taiwan carried out what were called Joint Combat Readiness Patrols along with Chinese [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1470.3s)]
*  warships. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1475.94s)]
*  So that's a reminder that China's sort of sending these messages that it's in the neighborhood [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1476.94s)]
*  and it's not going anywhere and Taiwan needs to be careful. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1482.26s)]
*  But as I said, the vote brought in the KMT, the party that China would rather do business [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1486.3s)]
*  with, was able to take 52 seats in the parliament, one more than the DPP. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1491.54s)]
*  And the Taiwan People's Party, the TPP, took eight. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1496.82s)]
*  So potentially there's a coalition there that can work together on legislation and potentially [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1499.54s)]
*  balance out DPP politics. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1504.94s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1506.86s)]
*  But in terms of the overall geopolitics, one fewer country where Taiwanese officials can [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1508.06s)]
*  feel safe and welcome to visit is not a good thing. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1513.1399999999999s)]
*  We've also noted previously China has tried to remove Taiwan from any involvement in agencies [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1516.7s)]
*  like the WHO, which was a real setback for a number of reasons, including that Taiwan [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1521.72s)]
*  had lots to contribute to global health efforts among other things. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1525.82s)]
*  So geopolitics roaring back, interesting vote in Taiwan. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1529.66s)]
*  Not sure whether it's going to raise the bar too much on tensions though. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1534.38s)]
*  So just a few things. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1539.9s)]
*  One, I just looked up the population of Nauru is 12,000. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1540.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1544.26s)]
*  And one wonders what the Chinese offered Nauru to bail. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1545.58s)]
*  I think your point about the Philippines and Japan is a really interesting one because [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1549.62s)]
*  much like the United States, we don't have official relations with Taiwan. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1555.14s)]
*  I think there are a lot of countries who are playing this game in which they may not have [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1559.42s)]
*  diplomatic ties with Taiwan. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1564.3s)]
*  And I think the breaking of diplomatic ties does send a disheartening message to Taiwan. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1566.06s)]
*  At the same time, I think that a lot of countries are still talking to Taiwan and they're not [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1571.0600000000002s)]
*  as isolated as that 11 sounds like. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1577.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point, Carla. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1579.5800000000002s)]
*  I would also note some countries, former communist countries in Eastern Europe, Czech Republic, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1580.74s)]
*  Lithuania, among others have been very straightforward in offering contacts and some bit of economic [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1585.94s)]
*  relations with Taiwan, I believe, which has enraged China. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1592.8600000000001s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1595.5800000000002s)]
*  I think it goes beyond just the official recognition. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1596.5800000000002s)]
*  But it continues to be a goal of China to shorten that list of formerly recognized countries. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1598.92s)]
*  I mean, the Chinese do this all the time. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1604.0s)]
*  It's like if countries invite in the Dalai Lama and then get whacked upside the head [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1605.72s)]
*  and the Chinese and certainly they're throwing their weight around in an enormous way at [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1610.8000000000002s)]
*  the UN. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1614.3600000000001s)]
*  Most of the places that we don't pay attention to committees, we don't pay attention to meetings, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1615.3600000000001s)]
*  we don't show up at certainly in the countries all over Latin America that complain that we're [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1619.24s)]
*  not showing up at meetings, that we're almost AWOL. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1624.24s)]
*  And the Chinese are everywhere. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1627.78s)]
*  And a big part of why they're everywhere is making sure that countries don't pay attention [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1629.1399999999999s)]
*  to Taiwan. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1632.52s)]
*  They are absolutely pointillious about that. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1633.52s)]
*  And the Taiwanese are pretty vigilant about also pushing back. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1636.48s)]
*  So this is a game that we're not paying enough attention to, both for our own interests and [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1639.54s)]
*  for Taiwan's interests. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1644.58s)]
*  But I don't think the Taiwanese are as isolated as those numbers would suggest. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1645.58s)]
*  And I think anybody who looks at what happened in Hong Kong and you look at the vibrancy [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1650.26s)]
*  of Taiwan's democracy, I think there's a real warning there as well that no one should [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1654.82s)]
*  be neglecting Taiwan's democracy. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1658.78s)]
*  At the same time, I think our own ambiguous policy given the reality of China's strength [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1660.78s)]
*  is also one. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1665.22s)]
*  So it's something that lots of countries have to make decisions about. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1666.22s)]
*  But Taiwan's democracy certainly needs to be celebrated. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1669.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1671.74s)]
*  And I think media experts are looking at the Taiwanese response to China's pretty heavy [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1672.74s)]
*  misinformation efforts and to see what lessons could be gleaned from that. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1676.74s)]
*  As we continue this year of epic elections worldwide and epic concerns over misinformation [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1681.86s)]
*  and AI and everything else. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1687.8999999999999s)]
*  Well that's our look at the wild world next week. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1690.1799999999998s)]
*  Here's some other stories to keep an eye on. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1693.58s)]
*  The state of New Hampshire holds presidential primaries for Democratic and Republican candidates. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1695.1399999999999s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen and Finnish PM Petri Orpo visit Sweden for talks on EU relations. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1699.4599999999998s)]
*  And member states of the Group of 77, remember that, meet in Uganda for what's known as the [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1705.34s)]
*  Third South Summit. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1709.7s)]
*  And this is Bob McMahon saying goodbye and be careful out there. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL302YHOGm8&t=1739.7s)]
