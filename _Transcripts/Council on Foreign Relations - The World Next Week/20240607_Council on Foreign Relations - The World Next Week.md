# European Parliament Elections, G7 Leaders’ 50th Summit, Powerful Hurricane Season Looming, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ)
*  In the coming week, European Parliament elections begin across the continent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  G7 leaders meet in Italy with a hefty agenda and forecasts call for an especially active [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=5.0s)]
*  hurricane season in the Atlantic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=10.16s)]
*  It's June 6, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=12.52s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Karl Anne Robbins. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Carla, let's start in Europe where there's going to be quite a lot of things going on [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=21.4s)]
*  playing out over the next week or so. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=26.36s)]
*  Today and through the weekend, close to 400 million Europeans are set to cast their ballots [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=28.36s)]
*  for 720 members of the European Parliament, the EU's legislative body. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=33.56s)]
*  Since the last election, the EU has faced surging migration and economic crisis. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=39.2s)]
*  The EU has been in a state of emergency for the past few weeks, and the EU has been in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=43.8s)]
*  And that has helped far-right parties gain strongholds across EU member states. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=48.4s)]
*  Polls are projecting a strong showing for far-right parties. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=60.28s)]
*  And what would that mean for EU policy going forward? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=63.76s)]
*  So Bob, let's back up for a minute. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  So in case you're wondering if anyone outside of Brussels or Strasbourg, which are the two [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=69.28s)]
*  homes for the European Parliament, care about these elections, Moscow apparently does. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=73.16s)]
*  Europeans are seeing a major push of Russian disinformation, claims that the French government [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=78.36s)]
*  is writing a tax to pay for Ukraine war, all sorts of claims about things like this incredible [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=83.28s)]
*  story that's going through in Germany that cyclists bled to death, a teenage cyclist [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=88.68s)]
*  bled to death because the German government supposedly turned off streetlights after it [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=93.04s)]
*  ran out of Russian gas. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=96.64000000000001s)]
*  And now there are denial of service attacks going on today. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  So the Russians are paying attention to this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=101.48s)]
*  Now a few basic facts about the vote. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  This isn't a single national election. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=106.46s)]
*  It's 27 elections in 27 member countries. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  Each state votes for its own representative and the number of seats they have is just [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  like the US House. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=115.82s)]
*  It's a portioned by population. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=116.82s)]
*  And the issues even vary state by state. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=119.78s)]
*  Although there are common issues, much like what we care about here, economy, the price [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=122.41999999999999s)]
*  of gas, Ukraine, migration. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  But more than anything, everyone's saying that the vote is likely to be a referendum [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  on current governments. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=133.82s)]
*  And so, as you said, people are likely going to be voting many more than have in the past [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=135.46s)]
*  four rightist parties. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=141.58s)]
*  So what are the polls saying? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  The two main blocks of centrist parties have long run the show in the parliament, the EPP, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  which is the European People's Party, which I love this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=151.38s)]
*  Politico Europe described as sort of like the Republicans, but anti-gun, pro-choice, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  and pro-NATO. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=158.86s)]
*  So really not like the Republicans at all. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=159.86s)]
*  And the center left Progressive Alliance of Socialist and Democrats, or S&D, which are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=162.56s)]
*  like the Democrats in the US, but more socialist. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  These two blocks are expected to continue to keep their hold on power and retain most [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=170.16s)]
*  of their seats. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=174.28s)]
*  But the Greens and the Centrist Renew Party are expected to lose a lot of seats. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=175.84s)]
*  And the two right wing blocks, which is the Nationalist European Conservatives and Reformists, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=180.32s)]
*  the ECR, which includes Georgia Maloney's brothers of Italy and Poland's Law and Justice [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=185.16s)]
*  Party we've talked about. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=190.24s)]
*  And the even harder line, far-right identity and democracy, which includes Marine Le Pen's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=192.12s)]
*  National Rally and Gert Wilder's Dutch Party for Freedom. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=196.56s)]
*  But recently tossed out Germany's AfD are expected to make a very strong showing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=200.88s)]
*  And together could end up with more seats than the reigning center-right European People's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=205.28s)]
*  Party, which is the current European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's party. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=208.96s)]
*  So some polls chillingly have these radical right wing parties on track to win the vote [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  in as many as half a dozen states, including France and Belgium and of course, Italy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=220.68s)]
*  So could they end up controlling the parliament? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=226.72s)]
*  Our colleague Mathias Matisse wrote on CFR.org this week that squabbling among the far-right [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  parties is likely to be so intense that even if they did have the most number of seats, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  they're unlikely to control the parliament since there are so many issues that divide [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  these right wing groups, including them Ukraine and European values. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=244.06s)]
*  So they may come out ahead with most of the seats. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=247.9s)]
*  They're unlikely to control the parliament and to control the votes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=250.34s)]
*  As for why we should pay attention, it's interesting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=254.88s)]
*  I mean, this is such a complicated structure. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=258.14s)]
*  The EU commissioners, which is the executive branch of the EU, actually proposes laws. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=260.86s)]
*  The parliament can't do it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=264.98s)]
*  Parliament still improves the budget and ultimately has to vote on these laws. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=267.1s)]
*  And if a growing number of European voters turn rightward, it could lead all the political [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=270.46s)]
*  leaders in the EU, in the individual governments, the EU commissioners and ultimately the parliament [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=274.34s)]
*  as well to take a hard look at all these policies from climate change to migration and of course, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=279.61999999999995s)]
*  support for Ukraine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=285.78s)]
*  Take a really hard look at all those things and that's going to really matter, particularly [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=287.32s)]
*  if we take a right return in the United States. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=290.52s)]
*  Carla, thanks for spelling that all out because I do think it is a bewilderment to outside [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  watchers, although they all understand it's an important democratic exercise. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=297.41999999999996s)]
*  One of the deliverables or one of the important consequences also is, I believe, the naming [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=301.96s)]
*  of the European Commission president. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=306.68s)]
*  So Ursula von Delaney, as you mentioned, her party's involved. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=308.44s)]
*  My understanding is she still is poised to be possibly renewed and has been running some [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=311.73999999999995s)]
*  campaigning on her own. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=317.18s)]
*  That would be important, wouldn't it, because of her pretty strong and outspoken support [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=318.56s)]
*  for the transatlantic alliance on the Ukraine front and so forth. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=321.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  She's not on a ballot, okay? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  Nobody votes for... [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=327.96s)]
*  The Commission is the executive branch for the EU and the way this works is that the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=329.6s)]
*  heads of government in Europe, they choose, they nominate who's going to be the head of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=336.48s)]
*  the Commission and the Parliament has to, a majority of the Parliament has to sign off [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=342.12s)]
*  on it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=345.64000000000004s)]
*  The expectation is that they will follow who the big winners are and the European People's [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=346.88s)]
*  Party is still expected to come out ahead and she's their candidate. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  This is not a national vote here for who's going to be the president and it's not even [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=358.44s)]
*  a parliamentary vote. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=362.36s)]
*  They could, the heads of government could choose somebody else. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=363.96s)]
*  They did last time around. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=367.16s)]
*  It wasn't who the Parliament wanted. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=368.92s)]
*  They chose somebody different and they ended up choosing von der Leyen. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=371.2s)]
*  She's not, and there are several other candidates out there campaigning, she's not on a ballot [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=375.82s)]
*  anywhere, but she's campaigning like she is on a ballot. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=379.76s)]
*  She's gone to 11 countries. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=382.12s)]
*  There's been debates, there's been stump speeches. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=383.6s)]
*  She is not as popular as she was last time around. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=386.6s)]
*  There's been a variety of issues that have come up here. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=389.48s)]
*  The betting is that she'll get the job anyway and she's been a very good interlocutor for [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=392.06s)]
*  the Transatlantic Alliance and a huge supporter of Ukraine. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=396.56s)]
*  So we'll see what happens here. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=400.06s)]
*  And once again, a lot of this really matters, particularly if Trump wins the election here [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=402.16s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=406.36s)]
*  Betting is it's going to be Ursula von der Leyen, but ultimately it's not the decision [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=408.58000000000004s)]
*  of the voters. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  Now, if she is nominated, the Parliament has to approve it, a majority has to approve [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=414.2s)]
*  it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=420.08s)]
*  And if her EPP party does as expected, she's still going to have to have a coalition of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=421.08s)]
*  seats in the Parliament to give her that majority vote. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=425.36s)]
*  And there is this whole question of who are they going to make a coalition with? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=428.76s)]
*  And there's even a suggestion that Georgia Maloney could be one of the kingmakers because [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=433.64s)]
*  her rightist group is going to get a lot of votes and that could cause a lot of problems. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  It could take quite a while for them to confirm von der Leyen or whoever is chosen. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=442.12s)]
*  You know, it makes me think, first of all, we should all be aware of sweeping sort of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=447.4s)]
*  conclusions after we see these votes come in because there are a lot, as you indicate, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=451.68s)]
*  lots of interplay going on even amid movements on the right or even the center right or center [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=455.36s)]
*  left. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=461.72s)]
*  But it does strike me also as just a really important democratic exercise. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  Voters are going to have choices to go in different directions, whether they are feeling [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=467.88s)]
*  concerned about issues like migration issues or environmental issues or whatever, the choices [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=472.88s)]
*  will be there for them. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  It's just at the end of the day, there's going to have to be some horse trading to emerge [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=479.48s)]
*  with whether a repeat of the leadership that we've had or whether we're going to see a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=483.08s)]
*  course change, which we've already seen on the national front, as you mentioned. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=486.96s)]
*  You know, let's take a country like the Netherlands, definitely gone to the right, although Geert [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=490.44s)]
*  Wilders, who you mentioned, has not been able to form a government. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=494.8s)]
*  So there's had to be a bit of horse trading there to come up with a consensus government [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=497.72s)]
*  that can actually rule the country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=502.52000000000004s)]
*  And they've already co-opted some of the more right leaning policies, whether it's on immigration [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=504.6s)]
*  or elsewhere, without going too far to the right in terms of being, let's say, blatantly [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=508.88s)]
*  anti-Muslim. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=513.2s)]
*  As important as this is, and for us, it's really hard to understand this complexity. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=514.2s)]
*  You've got a parliament, but they can't propose laws. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=520.6s)]
*  You've got a commissioned president, but who's not chosen either in a parliamentary [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=523.12s)]
*  system or in a direct vote. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=527.68s)]
*  This is a pretty complex thing. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=529.48s)]
*  Europeans also find it overly complex to understand. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  And so while this is the second largest vote in this year of elections after India's, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=535.28s)]
*  I believe, you're going to have to see how many people turn out to vote. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=538.92s)]
*  Europeans still see their own domestic elections as far more important. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=544.04s)]
*  And five years ago, only suddenly more than 50% of European voters showed up for this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=547.6s)]
*  parliamentary election. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=551.26s)]
*  Now, there's an overlap in several states with their own domestic elections, and that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=552.9s)]
*  may drive up the numbers. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=556.66s)]
*  But I think it's important. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=558.34s)]
*  I think it's going to tell you something about the future of Europe. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=560.54s)]
*  And I think it may have an impact on policies that are very important for us and the Transatlantic [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=562.98s)]
*  Alliance for the future Ukraine. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=566.86s)]
*  But we'll see whether they even meet that 50% vote. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=569.5s)]
*  Bob, let's stay in the EU region and move down to Italy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=573.34s)]
*  It's a lovely place to go. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=577.26s)]
*  Next Thursday, G7 leaders are going to meet in the seaside city of Puglia. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=579.1s)]
*  Is that a city or a region? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=583.38s)]
*  It's a region. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=585.14s)]
*  It's the region of Puglia. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=586.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=587.14s)]
*  Puglia for their 50th summit. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=588.14s)]
*  The agenda as it always is for the G7 is extensive. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=590.4200000000001s)]
*  The question of continued support for Ukraine, positions on the Israel-Palestine relationship, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=593.02s)]
*  de-risking from China, improving ties with Africa, safeguarding artificial intelligence. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=599.46s)]
*  And in a bid to make the G7 more inclusive, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Maloney, potential [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=605.82s)]
*  kingmaker on the EU Commission president, has invited a host of additional leaders with [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=611.66s)]
*  many from the global south. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=617.94s)]
*  What can we expect from this summit? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=619.44s)]
*  Well, we would be remiss in not mentioning that Zelensky, who we love to mention in showing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=621.78s)]
*  up at these events, is going to be there as well. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  That would be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=629.58s)]
*  And we should also mention Pope Francis, who I believe will be the first pope ever [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=632.86s)]
*  to attend one of these meetings, obviously not having to travel too far, and is particularly [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=635.74s)]
*  interested in AI issues. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=639.98s)]
*  So that is going to be intriguing. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=641.74s)]
*  But let's go back to Maloney because she has been taking this very seriously in terms of [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=643.36s)]
*  scoping out an agenda. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=647.76s)]
*  And she has been sort of an intriguing person in her own right in terms of when she came [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=649.64s)]
*  to office, there were all sorts of concerns about a rightward lurch in Italy. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=654.0600000000001s)]
*  But she took a number of interesting steps, including really full-throated support for [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=658.3000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine, taking Italy out of the Belt and Road initiative that China has been trying [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=662.06s)]
*  to extend well into Europe, and making statements like this one, when she says the G7 has a [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=667.06s)]
*  quote, increasingly important role in the defense of democratic values, the protection [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=672.2199999999999s)]
*  of the rules-based international system, and the ability to meet the challenges of our [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=676.38s)]
*  time. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=680.06s)]
*  That seems like a pretty consensus sort of view for a G7 host to be having. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=681.06s)]
*  And she's on top of it, she's going to be taking on an issue, I think, in much more [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=686.02s)]
*  of a robust way than we've seen the G7 before, which is migration. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=690.12s)]
*  Italy is a front-line country, obviously. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=693.48s)]
*  It's island of Lampedusa is inundated, really, with migrants who are fleeing really horrible [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=696.0s)]
*  situations in Middle East and Africa in particular. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=701.52s)]
*  And she's trying to take a multi-track approach. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=704.5999999999999s)]
*  The way she is framing it is a two-part effort she would like the G7 to coalesce around, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  which is going after the traffickers who are definitely taking advantage of these desperation [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=712.16s)]
*  of the migrants and clamping down and providing a concerted effort against those. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=716.68s)]
*  And then trying to find a way to deal with the problem at its source, which is helping [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=721.3599999999999s)]
*  source countries to further strengthen themselves, strengthen their own systems of governance [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=725.04s)]
*  and wellbeing so that migrants are not forced to flee in the first place. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=730.16s)]
*  That is the work of ages, frankly, given the scale of problems, but it is a start. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=734.5999999999999s)]
*  She has an initiative underway with Albania, an agreement, a five-year agreement in which [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=739.76s)]
*  Albania is going to host thousands of asylum seekers. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=743.64s)]
*  She just made a visit this week with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama to sign the deal. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=747.84s)]
*  And there's going to be other G7 countries keenly interested in this issue. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=753.16s)]
*  Obviously, the UK, Rishi Sunak, who's facing his own election next month, has tried to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=756.12s)]
*  put forward a deal with Rwanda where it would host asylum seekers and I believe other migrants [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=762.0600000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=767.08s)]
*  That deal seems to be stalled at the moment, but it is an issue front and center because [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=768.1600000000001s)]
*  the numbers of migrants are growing. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=772.88s)]
*  And this is, we should say, irregular migrants on top of the legal migration, which is at [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  a very high level as well, in part because of people leaving Ukraine and being allowed [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=778.7199999999999s)]
*  to resettle legally around Europe. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=783.68s)]
*  So it's a big issue. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=786.16s)]
*  We're going to look to the G7 for framing this and for giving us a sense of where it [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=787.52s)]
*  can go. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=791.5999999999999s)]
*  It's important to note looking at past G7 meetings maybe to see how they might come [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  down on issues. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=796.5999999999999s)]
*  In the last year's summit, for example, the G7 ministers committed to a joint agreement [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=797.92s)]
*  on climate protection and energy security, and the countries had agreed to offshore wind [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=802.36s)]
*  and solar capacity increases by 2030. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=807.28s)]
*  However, they could not agree on phasing out coal or restricting investments in natural [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=809.8399999999999s)]
*  gas. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=814.56s)]
*  And climate efforts have basically been shunted aside as countries deal front and center with [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=815.8s)]
*  energy prices surging. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  So it's a way of pointing out that the G7 will give you a sense of these still very [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=823.04s)]
*  strong and leading democratic economies on the issues of the day, but their ability to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=827.52s)]
*  sustain or take concerted action is sometimes limited. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=833.36s)]
*  So Maloney hasn't been any near as scary as many people feared, but migration obviously [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=837.5999999999999s)]
*  a scary issue for the right-wing parties. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=848.4s)]
*  And let's face it, she comes from a very right-wing party. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=852.28s)]
*  You described her policies that she's promoting in a rather anodyne way, Bob. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=856.04s)]
*  I beg your pardon. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=863.3199999999999s)]
*  Are you taking this? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=867.24s)]
*  Do you really believe that she really is concerned about traffickers and all that? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=868.24s)]
*  Is this just a cover for denying people who want asylum, the possibility of asylum under [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=874.0400000000001s)]
*  international law and EU law inside of Italy? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  She's broken with many people in her own party on questions like Ukraine. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=884.72s)]
*  Is she coming up with some sane ideas on migration or is this all a cover? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=889.6s)]
*  I think as it relates to traffickers, I mean, those who follow this issue closely will definitely [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=893.48s)]
*  acknowledge this is an issue. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=897.8000000000001s)]
*  There are networks and gangs in Italy. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=899.48s)]
*  Maloney knows criminal gangs and the mafia in particular are sort of seizing the opportunities [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=902.0s)]
*  here. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=907.84s)]
*  It seems to be a real thing in terms of the operational or the people capitalizing on [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=908.84s)]
*  the ongoing surge in migration and desperation of migrants. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=914.12s)]
*  So as far as that goes, I don't necessarily doubt that. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=918.88s)]
*  However, it's the issue of working with the partnerships with countries, not necessarily [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=922.28s)]
*  Albania, but countries on the front lines, Tunisia, a country that's lurching in an [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=927.88s)]
*  extremely authoritarian direction. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=932.0400000000001s)]
*  Egypt has an authoritarian government and the partnerships with those countries, there [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=933.52s)]
*  have been attempts to extend further into Africa and other countries, by the way, in [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=939.2800000000001s)]
*  Europe have tried to do the same thing. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=944.52s)]
*  I think on the one hand, it does make sense and the US has tried this in Central America [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=945.96s)]
*  too that you try to shore up the weak states or the front line states in a ways that allow [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=950.5600000000001s)]
*  them to deal with the problem rather than you having to deal with the problem. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=956.08s)]
*  Does it mean that they should be doing more to actually process properly and abide by [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=960.9200000000001s)]
*  their international law commitments? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=965.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=967.6s)]
*  At the same time, as you say, it's a hot, hot political issue, especially in a number [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=968.6s)]
*  of European countries where you have the demographics for the population increasing are particularly [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=974.0600000000001s)]
*  bad and having your traditionally Italian or German or other populations supplanted by [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=980.9000000000001s)]
*  Middle Eastern populations, for example, does not sit well with many in the population, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=988.38s)]
*  which again is feeding the populism of right-wing parties in particular, which is all to say [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=992.94s)]
*  that these countries are trying to stanch the flow of migrants. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=998.98s)]
*  I mean, recall what happened after the 2015 surge, which was higher than we've currently [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1002.5400000000001s)]
*  seen and you had a number of remarkable things. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1007.0200000000001s)]
*  You had both Angela Merkel opening up Germany in an extraordinary way that created though [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1009.98s)]
*  a backlash that fed the founding or the growing of the AfD, the Alternative for Deutschland [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1014.9399999999999s)]
*  Party, which is an extremely far right party. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1020.8199999999999s)]
*  You also had the EU countries making a deal with Turkey to be the country of the staging [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1024.42s)]
*  country, the country of permanent purgatory status for millions of people who would otherwise [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1030.66s)]
*  be fleeing across Mediterranean waters and other seas to get to Europe. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1035.86s)]
*  They had to make a deal there that was not necessarily a great thing, but it was a way [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1040.26s)]
*  of keeping the flows down. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1045.7s)]
*  They are back and they are coming from North Africa now, not from Turkey. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1048.22s)]
*  And the feeder issues, war, failed States, climate, all of these issues are not going [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1052.06s)]
*  to be settled overnight. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1057.66s)]
*  Something we've talked about repeatedly in podcasts, for example, the war in Sudan, it's [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1059.26s)]
*  horrible. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1063.74s)]
*  There's now signs of famine setting in there. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1064.74s)]
*  That's not going to be settled anytime soon. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1067.02s)]
*  And you can point to hotspots throughout certainly Africa and the Middle East to show the growing [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1069.6200000000001s)]
*  areas of where migrants are forced to make these moves. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1074.86s)]
*  So it's a long way of saying, Carla, there is some legitimacy in her approach, but there's [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1077.82s)]
*  also a sense of making a strong power move from a wealthier country towards a less wealthy [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1081.94s)]
*  country to try to offshore the problem a bit. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1087.98s)]
*  And we've seen this happen again and again. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1091.5s)]
*  And then of course, they're going to, I think, be wrestling with this question about what [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1093.34s)]
*  to do with frozen Russian funds. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1097.22s)]
*  Yes, that's another one worth watching, which is how much consensus is there for the interest [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1100.9399999999998s)]
*  that's accruing on frozen Russian funds, which is in the many, many tens, if not hundreds [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1107.62s)]
*  of billions of dollars, taking that and using it for reconstruction in Ukraine. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1112.3799999999999s)]
*  There seems to be growing support for that, although there are also some G7 countries [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1117.02s)]
*  that are wary of that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1120.6599999999999s)]
*  Russia has been warning against that and sort of trying to demonstrate how it could stage [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1122.34s)]
*  its own reprisals by seizing assets that are still in Russia itself from Western countries. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1127.22s)]
*  So it's not clear whether that's going to emerge as a full-fledged thing or not. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1132.62s)]
*  Certainly, again, I mentioned Zelensky. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1136.3799999999999s)]
*  There'll be talk about unifying behind him. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1138.62s)]
*  These meetings will be coming off of the big events that are playing out as we were taping [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1141.74s)]
*  this podcast on Normandy. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1146.1s)]
*  President Biden gave a big D-Day speech today. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1148.24s)]
*  He's going to give another one at Pointe du Hoc, this incredible cliff that was scaled [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1150.74s)]
*  by Army Rangers on D-Day. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1154.66s)]
*  And then he's going to have a state visit in France, and there's going to be ongoing [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1157.26s)]
*  discussions and reaffirmations of support for Ukraine. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1160.14s)]
*  So I think you'll see something from the G7 that at least rhetorically will be a statement [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1163.42s)]
*  of support in terms of concrete steps like the seizure of Russian assets or further sanctions. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1167.74s)]
*  Not sure yet how those are going to take shape. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1174.74s)]
*  We should also mention China continues to be on the mind of these countries as well, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1176.78s)]
*  and there'll be some talk about possible sanctions on China related to dumping of renewable [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1180.1s)]
*  energy equipment and so forth. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1185.78s)]
*  Bob, as a former Miamian, here's another story I am very concerned about. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1187.6999999999998s)]
*  June 1st marked the start of the Atlantic Basin's hurricane season. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1193.4599999999998s)]
*  And scientists are predicting a total of 204 storms this year, more than double the average [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1198.4199999999998s)]
*  and possibly somewhere between eight and 13 hurricanes. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1203.3799999999999s)]
*  And in response to these ever-increasing destruction costs, insurers are leaving the [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1207.74s)]
*  most affected states in droves. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1211.86s)]
*  Is this first of all climate change, and are we getting any better preparing for and surviving [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1214.7s)]
*  these storms? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1219.22s)]
*  It is in great part climate change because as we got the news about the hurricane season [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1220.22s)]
*  forecasts, following up that we have also seen further reporting about the sustained [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1226.58s)]
*  record setting temperatures now 12 months straight beyond the 1.5 degrees Celsius that [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1234.14s)]
*  countries in the parish accords had targeted as the level that they don't want to exceed [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1239.46s)]
*  or they were going to be facing major consequences. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1244.22s)]
*  The consequences are here. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1247.0200000000002s)]
*  Climate change among other things warms the oceans. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1248.94s)]
*  The oceans tend to be the area that captures most of the excess heat. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1251.74s)]
*  And then the oceans get warmer. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1256.3400000000001s)]
*  There is a dynamic that occurs that basically contributes to more and more powerful storms. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1258.06s)]
*  The hurricane season is a sign of that. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1263.22s)]
*  I should also mention the tornado season is going to pick up. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1266.26s)]
*  And we just had nearby here in the mid-Atlantic some tornadoes touched down in Maryland in [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1268.94s)]
*  ways that we have not seen before. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1274.94s)]
*  But the hurricane season is going to be one to watch. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1277.1s)]
*  These storms are incredibly powerful. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1280.22s)]
*  They're adding to the names. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1282.3999999999999s)]
*  They're creating extra categories for how to name these storms, extra categories for [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1283.3999999999999s)]
*  how to rate these storms. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1287.74s)]
*  And there's categories three, four, and five. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1289.8200000000002s)]
*  You hear five is winds of 111 miles per hour or excess. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1291.6200000000001s)]
*  We are seeing the forecast or average indicates something like 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1296.26s)]
*  and five major hurricanes. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1301.02s)]
*  And if they hit places like your beloved Florida or the Gulf Coast or they come up farther [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1303.5s)]
*  into the sort of mid-Atlantic area or they swirl around and maybe hit another part of [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1308.9s)]
*  the Gulf into Texas, they have incredible wind power and wind damage. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1314.74s)]
*  They have incredible amounts of rainfall that can come down. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1320.5s)]
*  And the signs are there already. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1324.78s)]
*  Back to your question on the resiliency. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1326.72s)]
*  Yeah, some towns are getting more focused. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1328.5s)]
*  Even places in which there are elected officeholders who are not so seized of climate change concerns [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1330.98s)]
*  and do not see the need to try to ramp up renewables and phase out fossil fuels. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1337.6s)]
*  They are still acknowledging the need to create plans and safeguards for these coastal [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1343.62s)]
*  communities that will not exist if this keeps on happening. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1349.9399999999998s)]
*  And I'm talking about Florida, I'm talking about Texas and the Gulf Coast as well. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1353.3s)]
*  They need to get better at it though. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1357.32s)]
*  And part of getting better at it though acknowledges what climate change is. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1359.0s)]
*  For me, it almost conjures up some of the vaccine denial response that you have. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1362.6599999999999s)]
*  Here you have a method for dealing with diseases that is ironclad proofing to be effective, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1367.34s)]
*  even with the reports of people who have problems with vaccines and so forth. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1372.76s)]
*  On balance, it is an incredibly effective way of fighting diseases. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1378.3s)]
*  Climate is far more complicated obviously, but its starting point is to phase out the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1382.4s)]
*  fossil fuel dependence and then deal with the changes that are here to stay. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1387.74s)]
*  And so that is building up infrastructure. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1391.8799999999999s)]
*  It's continuing to pour resources into forecasting. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1395.26s)]
*  You see actually a great deal of trust in the National Weather Service. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1399.72s)]
*  I saw a media survey that says the weather channel is considered the most trusted media [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1403.08s)]
*  in the country, in the US at this point. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1409.28s)]
*  So you have that, but you do have these weather services that are extremely diligent about [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1412.0s)]
*  trying to predict and then they do a kind of post mortem about what they got right and [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1416.1s)]
*  what they got wrong. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1419.8799999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to need more of that all along the line to understand what's happening [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1420.8799999999999s)]
*  here, to understand what an El Nino and La Nina is. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1424.9599999999998s)]
*  We're apparently cycling out of El Nino and turning into La Nina, which is supposed to [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1428.44s)]
*  bring a cooling phase to oceans and temperatures. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1433.0s)]
*  But that change in temperature also leads to all sorts of tough weather and sometimes [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1436.02s)]
*  really fierce weather responses, including a severe hurricane season. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1440.3200000000002s)]
*  So hold on for the next six months Carla, sorry to say. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1444.8s)]
*  And it's just a question of where these storms are going to go and how these communities [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1448.14s)]
*  are going to be able to build up their barricades, but also pick up the pieces afterwards because [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1453.5s)]
*  unfortunately we're going to be looking at that. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1459.02s)]
*  This of course reminds me of one of my truly favorite lines from one of the men in black [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1461.54s)]
*  movies, which the Tommy Lee Jones character of course has been had his brain scrambled [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1465.4599999999998s)]
*  so he doesn't remember he's a man in black. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1472.58s)]
*  And he talks about how his life has become normal and he describes his life as what he [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1474.6999999999998s)]
*  does. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1479.4199999999998s)]
*  I spend the weekends and I watch the Weather Channel. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1480.42s)]
*  So that's a little bit like a life I aspire to. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1483.1000000000001s)]
*  The Weather Channel is becoming a reality TV show, a gripping reality TV show that is [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1488.54s)]
*  unfortunately getting more and more dramatic. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1493.3000000000002s)]
*  Well Carla, I'd love to talk more about the disintegration of our weather system, but [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1496.5800000000002s)]
*  let's go to the audience figure of the week. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1500.78s)]
*  This is the figure that listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1504.5600000000002s)]
*  org's Instagram story. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1507.8600000000001s)]
*  This week our audience seemed to be channeling this fossil fuel issue. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1510.5600000000002s)]
*  They selected OPEC plus cuts 5.8 million barrels a day of oil production. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1514.14s)]
*  Do these cuts mean that we should worry about summer gas prices, Carla? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1519.8400000000001s)]
*  Directly related to the previous conversation of course. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1524.5600000000002s)]
*  And yes, the Saudis and Russians are certainly hoping that we should be worrying about rising [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1527.0s)]
*  summer gas prices. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1531.8400000000001s)]
*  Interestingly, US average national gas prices right now are $3.56 a gallon and that's actually [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1534.0s)]
*  a penny less than they were a year ago. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1541.16s)]
*  And that's even with all that is happening in the Middle East, the war in Gaza, attacks [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1544.12s)]
*  on Red Sea shipping by the Houthis. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1548.16s)]
*  The global benchmark price of Brent crude is in the $81 to $83 per barrel range for [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1550.2s)]
*  the last month or so after surging far above $100 a barrel in the months after Russia invaded [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1556.36s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1562.04s)]
*  So OPEC plus, which is OPEC plus Russia and several others have been trying for more than [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1563.68s)]
*  a year to push the prices back up to that $100 range. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1568.44s)]
*  And this week's statement extends a series of collective cuts that began more than a [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1573.72s)]
*  year ago. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1578.64s)]
*  And it extended another group of voluntary cuts as well by eight of the largest producers, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1579.76s)]
*  but with a phase out calendar. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1585.4s)]
*  And it seems that instead of focusing on the cuts, traders seem to be more focused on that [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1587.68s)]
*  phase out at least for now. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1591.68s)]
*  So as of 8 a.m. today, Thursday, New York time, the price of Brent crude was, I sound [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1594.3s)]
*  like I'm on a different channel, price of Brent crude was $77.48, so far below that [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1599.5600000000002s)]
*  $100, far below even the 80 to 83 that it has been. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1610.76s)]
*  So economists have a variety of explanations for why these cuts over the last year have [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1614.72s)]
*  yet to work. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1619.6000000000001s)]
*  More economic growth in China may have reduced oil demand, non-OPEC supplies, good part [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1621.04s)]
*  US shale producers. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1627.08s)]
*  And there's been a growing global investment, the good news, in clean energy. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1630.04s)]
*  We'll see whether these new cuts eventually get priced in. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1634.68s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1639.1599999999999s)]
*  As for the $100 a barrel a goal, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince MBS really wants that money. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1640.1599999999999s)]
*  He wants increased oil profits to fund what he calls his Vision 2030 to ultimately diversify [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1647.1s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's economy. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1652.2199999999998s)]
*  And that's especially true after he's failed to drum up as much foreign direct investment [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1654.8999999999999s)]
*  as he'd been looking for for that project. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1658.6599999999999s)]
*  And we all know why Russia wants more money. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1661.3s)]
*  They want higher oil prices to sustain its war economy, which is really a good reason [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1663.3s)]
*  to not be driving your cars. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1667.98s)]
*  So on Thursday, interestingly, with the market not doing what they wanted, OPEC plus ministers [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1671.02s)]
*  were meeting in St. Petersburg and they said they could revisit the agreement, including [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1676.54s)]
*  the promised phase out. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1680.3s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1682.3s)]
*  And Russia, of course, has been having to offer their sales at a discount just to keep [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1684.54s)]
*  some of the buyers interested in their sanctioned energy supplies. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1688.82s)]
*  But any sort of increase somehow will trickle to them in a positive way. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1693.18s)]
*  So yeah, that is one of the many stakes here with this decision. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1697.58s)]
*  OPEC plus, while maybe less of a dominant feature in the global markets previously, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1701.3s)]
*  is still really important to watch. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1707.38s)]
*  And we're going to see what the summer holds for US autos. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1709.18s)]
*  And we should also mention the EV industry, the electric vehicle industry is in a bit [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1712.46s)]
*  of a flux right now, too. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1716.42s)]
*  They're trying to slash prices, but they still are far above other price costs. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1718.5s)]
*  And the whole infrastructure for charging and so forth seems a bit lagging as well. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1723.5s)]
*  More to come, I'm sure, Carla. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1728.26s)]
*  And is MBS coming to the G7 meeting, Bob? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1729.74s)]
*  Carla, as far as we know, he has not accepted yet. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1732.7s)]
*  So we're not sure if he's going to show up at G7. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1735.18s)]
*  And I'm not sure he was invited there for his global South credential so much as those [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1738.22s)]
*  oil prices. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1744.42s)]
*  We should mention that he and many other global South countries are represented in the G20, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1745.7s)]
*  which has stolen some of the G7s thunder in recent years. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1750.3s)]
*  Referring to the Saudis as the global South is an interesting concept. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1753.7s)]
*  Well, that's our look at the world next week. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8vwjEu5RTQ&t=1758.02s)]
