# Congress’s Funding Battle, Iran Sends Missiles to Russia, Orbán Defies the EU, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A)
*  In the coming week, the U.S. Congress gears up for a high-stakes funding battle, reports [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=0.0s)]
*  of an Iranian missile transfer to Russia signal a new escalation in Ukraine, and Hungary faces [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=6.16s)]
*  a 200 million euro fine by the EU for breaking asylum law. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=11.4s)]
*  It's September 12, 2024 and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=15.64s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=31.0s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=32.64s)]
*  Carly, let's start on the Hill. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=33.64s)]
*  Cue the Kate Bush song, Running Up That Hill, if you have to. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=35.76s)]
*  Hobbling up the hill. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=39.16s)]
*  This past Monday, Congress came back from its summer recess and to say it had a full [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=40.16s)]
*  schedule is understatement. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=44.82s)]
*  One of the things dominating headlines right away is the looming September 30th deadline [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=47.5s)]
*  for funding federal discretionary programs. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Members of Congress do not want a government shutdown by many accounts, especially with [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  election day less than two months away, but battles over the budget are already underway. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=59.8s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson has faced pushback already to his proposed stopgap funding measures. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=64.16s)]
*  So Carla, how likely will we see a new budget approved then in the coming week or weeks? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=69.32s)]
*  Bob, these funding fights usually bring out some of the worst impulses in Congress, but [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=75.16s)]
*  you really think that an impending election would give them a really strong incentive [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  to do the people's business and find some compromise to keep the government open. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  But so far, at least, that hasn't happened. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=89.36s)]
*  The fiscal year ends on September 30th and funding, as you said, for discretionary programs, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=92.4s)]
*  and it's about a third of the federal budget runs out on September 30th. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=97.4s)]
*  And House members and the third of the Senate up for reelection, they are really eager to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=101.52s)]
*  get back on the campaign trail right after they solve this budget problem. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=105.8s)]
*  So they need either to pass a budget, which is really completely unlikely at this late [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=111.36s)]
*  or pass a stopgap spending bill, what's called a continuing resolution, which really just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=116.16s)]
*  kicks the can down the road with funding at current levels for some period of time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=120.92s)]
*  And if they don't, we get that government shutdown. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=126.92s)]
*  And there was always going to be considerable brinkmanship in this time period before they [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=129.72s)]
*  got to some agreement on a CR. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=134.04s)]
*  And increasingly looks like, once again, House Speaker Mike Johnson can't even control his [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=136.56s)]
*  own caucus. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=140.62s)]
*  He had planned to call for a vote Wednesday yesterday in a six-month CR paired with the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=142.12s)]
*  so-called SAVE Act, which is supposed to stop non-citizens from voting, something that is, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=147.6s)]
*  of course, already completely illegal. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=153.52s)]
*  And this twofer would never have made it through the Senate, but it was supposed to increase [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=156.5s)]
*  his leverage with Democrats, but Johnson pulled the bill yesterday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=160.24s)]
*  And pretty much everybody in his caucus and out hated him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  The Pentagon and GOP defense hawks, including the chair of the House Armed Services Committee, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=168.04s)]
*  said continuing defense spending at current levels for six months would utterly hobble [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=172.84s)]
*  military preparedness. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=177.48s)]
*  Spending hawks, meanwhile, were saying that continuing overall spending for another six [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=179.92s)]
*  months at current levels was just too much. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  They wanted to start hacking away. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=185.88s)]
*  And especially if Trump wins, they wanted to start the process a lot earlier than that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=187.88s)]
*  A more traditional three-month CR, which would go through December, would get everybody past [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=191.72s)]
*  the election, kick it down the road a little bit. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=197.12s)]
*  Then they'd know who was going to win. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  So it would mollify both hawk camps, keep the government open, save the incoming president [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=202.28s)]
*  of either party from an early showdown in the beginning of her or his term. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  But as Punchbowl noted this morning, it also means that Johnson would be trying to cut [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=213.0s)]
*  a deal with Democrats in his own party at a period of time when he was also trying to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=216.68s)]
*  save his own job for the next Congress. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=222.24s)]
*  So he didn't have a really strong interest on that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=224.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is demanding that his party shut the government down if they [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  don't get the SAVE Act through as part of any budget deal. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=231.6s)]
*  Shut it down, shut it down. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=235.12s)]
*  And for Trump, as we all know, this is his favorite political fodder. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=236.68s)]
*  Since 2016, he's been claiming that millions of undocumented migrants have been voting. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=239.84s)]
*  There's absolutely no evidence of that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=245.48s)]
*  And he claimed it again in the debate. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=249.52s)]
*  So Johnson's in a really tough space. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=250.96s)]
*  Will they cut a deal before September 30? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  I certainly hope so. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  They're going to have to cut one. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=258.44s)]
*  I can't imagine that they're going to shut the government down. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=259.52s)]
*  But he's in a really tough spot. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=262.04s)]
*  Yeah, you've basically described some of the scramble and divisions that are not only [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=264.32s)]
*  between parties but within parties, especially within the Republican Party, Carla. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=270.44s)]
*  And the SAVE Act effort is particularly important to watch because there are continuing to be [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  concerns about ahead of Election Day from the Trump campaign, the raising of the prospect [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=281.96s)]
*  of this being an invalid election in some respects. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  So there are all sorts of ominous signs that are percolating through this budget discussion. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  You're right, it's hard to imagine them not renewing it by September 30. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=296.44s)]
*  But things are going to get ugly, I think. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=299.64s)]
*  Well, the SAVE Act is certainly, we would say, why wouldn't you want people to prove [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=301.12s)]
*  that they were citizens to vote? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  People don't get to register to vote just walking in off the street. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=307.67999999999995s)]
*  They do have to have some proof. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=310.96s)]
*  But making people provide further proof at this point or new proof, you know, real ID, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=313.12s)]
*  there's bringing your passport. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=319.2s)]
*  A lot of people don't have passports. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=320.2s)]
*  Some people don't have driver's license. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=323.02s)]
*  To put more restrictions on people's ability to vote is really an attempt at intimidation [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=324.94s)]
*  or voter suppression. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  And there's enough of that going on as it is. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=331.96s)]
*  And when there isn't a problem that exists in the first place. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=335.08s)]
*  And we have enough doubt that's being fueled by social media, enough doubt that's being [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=338.16s)]
*  fueled by so many politicians out there already. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=342.64s)]
*  Why would you want to do this for any other reason other than either political posturing? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=345.56s)]
*  Because you believe you're going to lose the election and you really want to disrupt [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=350.0s)]
*  it in the first place. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=353.12s)]
*  Shutting it down for the sake of raising more doubts about the election, that's not a great [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=354.88s)]
*  thing for democracy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=359.36s)]
*  So this is just a political game and it's really undermining democracy and also undermining [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=360.56s)]
*  the budget process right now. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=365.8s)]
*  There's also going to be a lot of other stupid petricks on the Hill in the next few weeks. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=368.44s)]
*  We've got investigations which are going on for both parties because both parties are [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=372.24s)]
*  running on the Democratic side. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  We're seeing that they're calling for investigations of Jamie Raskin from Maryland who's the top [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=379.56s)]
*  Democrat on the Oversight Committee and Representative Robert Garcia from California, top Democrat [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  on the panel subcommittee for national security. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=389.88s)]
*  The border and foreign affairs are requesting proof from former President Trump that he [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=392.32s)]
*  never received money from Egypt. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  And then the Republicans have got a whole host of the ongoing investigations that's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=399.28s)]
*  been going on. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  They've been investigating forever. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=404.6s)]
*  Whatever they want, Biden-Harris administration for the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=406.62s)]
*  They're holding hearings this week on the quote, Biden-Harris border crisis victim perspective. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=411.28s)]
*  From gas to groceries, Americans pay the price of the Biden-Harris energy agenda. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=416.76s)]
*  House Affairs Committee hearing accountable absence, examining VA leadership. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=421.76s)]
*  Johnson thanked the committee that was talking about impeaching Biden. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  Listen, if the VA is not doing a good job, if there's problems with grocery prices, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=430.36s)]
*  things should be investigated. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  But whether or not there's going to be serious work done or all this is all an attempt, they [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=436.8s)]
*  want to go after Walsh for the first time. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=440.52s)]
*  This is a guy who never got anybody's attention, but suddenly he's a vice presidential candidate. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=443.12s)]
*  Here's my particular favorite one. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=448.2s)]
*  The House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into alleged contact that Walsh [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=450.1s)]
*  had with Chinese Communist Party entities dating back to the early 1990s when he was [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=454.5s)]
*  leading student groups to China. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=459.66s)]
*  Remember when the Clinton contacts, I think when he was a Rhodes Scholar, the alleged [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=461.34000000000003s)]
*  contacts he had or whenever his travel. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=465.70000000000005s)]
*  A lot of this stuff is just silly stuff. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=468.42s)]
*  If it weren't in an election year, it's pretty pernicious once it gets picked up by social [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=470.5s)]
*  media. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=474.14000000000004s)]
*  So do the people's business and go back to campaigning is what I have to say. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=475.14000000000004s)]
*  It's such a bad reflection on the US, as you say, for the integrity of its democracy, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=479.26s)]
*  for things like you mentioned, the defense funding issue. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=483.82s)]
*  If countries are seeing a weakened US, that is not going to be doing the country's business [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  either. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=492.18s)]
*  We had a rare bipartisan moment where the former and current president were at the 9-11 [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=493.18s)]
*  ceremony the other day, which is a reminder that the country needs to pull together at [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=498.02s)]
*  certain moments, and that's one of them. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=501.04s)]
*  But it also needs to pull together to get its house in order ahead of a major election. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=502.94s)]
*  It's just the rancor and the pettiness is really bad and again, raising new concerns [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=507.42s)]
*  at an already fraught moment. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=512.94s)]
*  What is going to happen after the vote, the election day, because if it is as close as [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=515.26s)]
*  the polls are suggesting, we may not have an outcome for potentially days, potentially [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=520.34s)]
*  longer. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=525.58s)]
*  And once again, raising doubts about the integrity of the vote and fanning those doubts is so [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=526.58s)]
*  frightening and we're seeing it so many places on the state level, not good for us. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=532.3s)]
*  And we don't need that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=536.58s)]
*  We really don't need it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=538.38s)]
*  We need to be pulling together and believing in what is intrinsically very strong system. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=539.46s)]
*  Bob, let's talk about Iran. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=544.82s)]
*  This past Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=547.5400000000001s)]
*  Lammy publicly accused Tehran of selling short-range ballistic missiles to Russia. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=552.0200000000001s)]
*  Other allies have joined in and everyone's marshaling new sanctions. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=558.26s)]
*  Antony in support for Russia's war effort, that's really no surprise. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=563.46s)]
*  We know about drones and all sorts of other things they've been providing to Moscow. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  So why are Washington and its allies making such a strong denunciation now? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=570.4s)]
*  And is there anything they can do to choke off these transfers? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=575.8199999999999s)]
*  Ukraine's struggling missile defense system we know is already severely overstretched. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=579.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a lot of things happening at the same time and I think by all appearances [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=583.42s)]
*  you've had US and UK intelligence, which are very tight, maybe the tightest intelligence [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=589.68s)]
*  relationship in the world, have seemed to confirm the shipment at a Russian Caspian [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=594.2399999999999s)]
*  Sea port, Russia shares the Caspian Sea with Iran, it's right across the Caspian, of 200 [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=599.4s)]
*  what are known as Foth 360 short-range ballistic missiles. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=603.0s)]
*  This transfer and the volume of these coming at a time when Russia has been lobbying seemingly [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  everything at Ukraine and hitting hospitals, military colleges, train stations, apartment [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=611.3599999999999s)]
*  buildings, and above all energy installations have really raised a lot of concern about [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=617.68s)]
*  what's coming next. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=623.92s)]
*  And so I think you've had that these two countries where you had the foreign secretary and the [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=625.12s)]
*  US secretary of state arriving in Ukraine at the same time, so David Lammy of UK and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=629.2399999999999s)]
*  Antony Blinken, they were able to confer on this. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=634.14s)]
*  We're going to have a meeting tomorrow, so Friday in Washington with the still new UK [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=637.42s)]
*  Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Joe Biden to discuss this issue and a very important [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=642.4799999999999s)]
*  related issue, which is justification for using US and British weapons to launch into [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=647.02s)]
*  Russia itself. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=653.5799999999999s)]
*  Now there's a Ukrainian incursion there, many people have pointed to the fact that, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=654.5799999999999s)]
*  hey, this is a Putin red line and the Ukrainians have been there for weeks, what about we walk [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=658.54s)]
*  over another red line, which is allowing weapons to strike inside Russia and strike things [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=662.84s)]
*  like Russian arms depots and fuel depots and so forth. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=667.6999999999999s)]
*  And using the weapons they already have. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=671.42s)]
*  And using weapons they already have, so things like the Atacom's long-range rocket systems [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  and there's a British storm shadow missiles that have been mentioned as well. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=677.0200000000001s)]
*  And the UK seems more than ready to allow theirs. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=680.5400000000001s)]
*  So really important meeting coming up, a lot of messaging ahead of that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=684.0200000000001s)]
*  And by the way, it's not just Iranian missiles that are coming, there's fresh reports that [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=688.0600000000001s)]
*  North Korean missiles and again, both of them in violation of sanctions are coming into [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=691.26s)]
*  Russia that I should say in Russia using them. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=696.38s)]
*  They've done forensics on missiles that have been already used in Ukraine and found [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=698.3000000000001s)]
*  North Korean markings on them. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=702.86s)]
*  This is a broadening of the scope of what Russia is using to add to its base. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=704.9s)]
*  It's on a wartime footing by all accounts in terms of what it's trying to do, but it [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=710.0999999999999s)]
*  needs these Iranian drones. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=714.0999999999999s)]
*  It's used them extensively by many accounts. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=715.4599999999999s)]
*  These North Korean missiles and other armaments apparently are being put to use. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=717.78s)]
*  China has been saying it's strictly providing some tech and other support, but US officials [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=722.66s)]
*  are increasingly warning China against providing Russia with the wherewithal to mount a ramped [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=728.3399999999999s)]
*  up effort that is really, again, punishing Ukraine and Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=732.66s)]
*  There's not going to be any sort of a defense shield safety net over Ukraine anytime soon [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=740.02s)]
*  that's impermeable. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=744.74s)]
*  So this is a moment of potentially really ratcheting up this campaign if Ukraine gets [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=745.6999999999999s)]
*  the green light to use these weapons into Russia. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=751.2199999999999s)]
*  Iran has already summoned four European ambassadors on Thursday, the ones who have imposed new [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=754.26s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=761.7s)]
*  They called in the British, Dutch, French, and German ambassadors, and they are fiercely [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=762.34s)]
*  denying this intel. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=767.62s)]
*  I think that's really quite interesting. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=769.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, they haven't denied a lot of other things that we've accused them of doing it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=771.46s)]
*  And these were very specific accusations. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=775.22s)]
*  Why do you think they're so fiercely denying this particular one? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=778.4200000000001s)]
*  Is there a possibility we got the intel wrong, or are the potential for sanctions coming [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=781.86s)]
*  so fiercely? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=787.7800000000001s)]
*  Is there a possibility that one hand in Iran doesn't know what the other hand is doing? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=789.0600000000001s)]
*  I think it's a mixture of those, Carla, but especially the last one you mentioned. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=795.3000000000001s)]
*  We've seen reports before that Iran has multiple power structures and has a number of power [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=799.86s)]
*  centers that report directly to the Supreme Leader, others that sort of run their own [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=805.78s)]
*  show. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=809.78s)]
*  And they had at one point denied the supplying of drones and swore up and down they were not [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=810.4200000000001s)]
*  providing drones, for example, until it became overwhelmingly clear that they were. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=816.34s)]
*  They've had tight relationship with Russia. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=821.22s)]
*  They've had visits from Russian defense officials, then defense minister Shoigu back in 2023, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=823.0600000000001s)]
*  had a tour of ballistic missile systems. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=829.3000000000001s)]
*  There's all sorts of this kind of circumstantial evidence that the two sides are talking about [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=831.86s)]
*  all sorts of these types of things. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=836.1s)]
*  And as I said, the intel on the US has been very strong throughout this war about what's [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=838.02s)]
*  being used and the movements of armaments and so forth. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=843.86s)]
*  So it seems very plausible. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=847.22s)]
*  I think there was definitely Iranian concern about, even though it's already considered [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=849.14s)]
*  to be the most sanctioned country in the world, adding up Iran air and additional individuals [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=853.22s)]
*  further got their attention. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=859.46s)]
*  There's a new civilian administration under President Pesachin that would like to step [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=861.0600000000001s)]
*  out and open up the Iranian economy a little bit more. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=866.58s)]
*  His first visit was to Iraq just this week. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=869.3000000000001s)]
*  He's going to be coming to the United Nations and speaking at the upcoming General Assembly [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=872.34s)]
*  high-level debate. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=876.4200000000001s)]
*  So maybe Iran wants to not be seen as playing dirty pool, but actually trying to be a responsible [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=877.94s)]
*  member of the international community, to use a term that's much derided. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=885.7s)]
*  It's a number of things going on. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=889.46s)]
*  I do think there could be very much a disconnect within Iran in terms of who's controlling what [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=890.98s)]
*  levers. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=896.4200000000001s)]
*  But it will be interesting to see what follows in terms of further information because the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=897.3000000000001s)]
*  U.S. pattern has been to announce these types of things and then follow up with pretty ironclad [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=902.74s)]
*  proof. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=908.9s)]
*  So we'll have to see. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=909.14s)]
*  Remember right before the invasion of Ukraine, the warning of Russian buildups at the borders [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=910.5s)]
*  while Russian officials were denying it right and left. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=915.62s)]
*  That's the Russian side of it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=918.02s)]
*  But again, the pattern of this war, the pattern of Russian contacts has been to arm up and [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=919.46s)]
*  not only to arm up, but to make use of its capabilities. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=924.58s)]
*  And we're seeing it over and over again. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=928.5s)]
*  And it's becoming clear that Ukraine is being crippled in all sorts of ways that its defenders [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=930.26s)]
*  and its big backers like the United States and the UK just have had enough of. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=936.58s)]
*  Do you think that the Biden administration is going to change its position on using American [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=940.4200000000001s)]
*  the Atacams and other weapons to hit deeply inside of Russia? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=946.4200000000001s)]
*  It certainly seems like they're prepared to do that in terms of some of the language that's [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=950.0200000000001s)]
*  coming out, some of the comments that Antony Blinken has made about what Russia has done [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=954.42s)]
*  and what Ukraine should be allowed to do. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=959.3s)]
*  It still would mark a really big departure though, and sort of a move into unknown territory [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=962.0999999999999s)]
*  in terms of how Russia would respond. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=968.02s)]
*  And Russia continues to send out ominous warnings about it will be responding in due course. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=969.4599999999999s)]
*  It has done things like announcing it's changing its nuclear weapons posture based on recent [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=974.5799999999999s)]
*  events like the Ukrainian invasion and other things. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=980.9s)]
*  It's not clear what Russia is prepared to do on the military front, but we could be entering [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=984.1s)]
*  into a really dangerous new chapter, which is why this has been resisted for so long. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=989.14s)]
*  But again, other things that the US and its allies have refrained from doing and then have done [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=994.02s)]
*  in terms of allowing other armaments within Ukraine, in terms of the seizure of frozen [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=999.86s)]
*  Russian assets or allowing the interest from those frozen assets to be used, those have [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1004.02s)]
*  all sort of been approved even though on the latter front they've been slow walking it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1009.62s)]
*  So it feels like they are ready to announce some sort of limited use of these weapons into Russia. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1013.46s)]
*  You'll see some carefully worded language potentially coming out in the next couple of days. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1019.94s)]
*  But watch the Starmor-Biden meeting coming up. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1023.7s)]
*  Karla Kulukovic An argument can be made that we have [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1025.94s)]
*  self-deterred and then we change our mind, but it's always so late and Ukraine has more rubble [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1027.8600000000001s)]
*  piled up as we deter ourselves. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1033.6200000000001s)]
*  John Del Vecchio And so it goes, yes. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1035.6200000000001s)]
*  Karla, let's stay in the European theater, but shift a bit west to Hungary. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1037.7s)]
*  Tuesday is the second deadline for Hungary to pay a 200 million euro fine for breaking EU asylum laws. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1042.02s)]
*  Back in 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled it was illegal for Hungary to detain and deport [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1049.3799999999999s)]
*  asylum seekers without giving them a chance to appeal the rejection of their applications. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1053.54s)]
*  Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been defiant. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1058.42s)]
*  He's missed the first deadline to pay this fine and has suggested Hungary will continue to flout [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1061.86s)]
*  this EU asylum law. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1068.26s)]
*  So is there any recourt for the European Court of Justice or EU levers to force his hand? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1070.26s)]
*  Karla Kulukovic Well, the European Court of Justice doesn't [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1075.54s)]
*  have bailiffs and it doesn't have troops. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1078.58s)]
*  There's no Brown versus the Board of Education. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1081.06s)]
*  There's no troops that go there. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1083.14s)]
*  But the EU has some levers in this and they've been able to push Orban around a little bit, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1085.14s)]
*  although one would say that Orban pushes back more than he gets pushed. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1091.06s)]
*  We chose this topic before Orban got his shout out at the debate as the European story man who [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1095.46s)]
*  most values President Trump. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1101.06s)]
*  And the story is interesting because it is a reminder how much the issue of immigration [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1104.1000000000001s)]
*  is bedeviling politics in so many countries, not just the United States. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1109.46s)]
*  Germany, which has been one of the most generous in Europe toward asylum seekers, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1114.3400000000001s)]
*  announced that it is going to place tighter controls at all of its land borders starting [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1118.1000000000001s)]
*  September 16th for at least six months. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1123.22s)]
*  And this latest move came after a knife attack by asylum seekers in the city of Solingen, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1125.94s)]
*  killed three people in August, and the Islamic State claimed responsibility. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1130.5s)]
*  And the anti-immigrant AFD earlier this month became the first far-right party since World War [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1135.3s)]
*  II to win a state election. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1139.94s)]
*  And there's more state elections coming in Germany, so that government's very nervous [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1141.06s)]
*  about the anti-immigrant feelings in Germany. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1144.58s)]
*  There's further controls already placed in Austria and Switzerland and Poland. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1147.6200000000001s)]
*  Orban's fight with the European Court is also a reminder of how much the world is watching [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1152.5s)]
*  what happens in the US in response to this and not always in the best way. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1156.4199999999998s)]
*  Orban has accused, quote, Brussels bureaucrats of caring more about illegal migrants than [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1161.2199999999998s)]
*  their own European citizens. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1166.34s)]
*  Sounds like rhetorically we've heard a lot of here. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1167.78s)]
*  And after the court ruled and included not just this 200 million euro fine, they've slapped also [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1170.4199999999998s)]
*  an additional fine for each day Hungary is now threatening. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1177.06s)]
*  Whether they'll ever be able to collect is another thing. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1180.02s)]
*  Like we've seen Texas Governor Abbott and we've seen Ron DeSantis in Florida, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1182.8200000000002s)]
*  Hungarians are now threatening to bus migrants, allegedly voluntarily, into Brussels. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1187.14s)]
*  They like migrants so much they can have them is the way they're talking about them. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1192.5s)]
*  The Belgians are not amused by this. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1196.3400000000001s)]
*  Brussels mayor is demanding that Belgium's prime minister block the buses at the border, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1198.98s)]
*  something that we at least have not done in our cities in the United States. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1204.66s)]
*  And what the Brussels mayor said was, quote, how long are we going to tolerate these [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1209.22s)]
*  provocations from a country that we subsidize, which is Hungary. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1214.66s)]
*  And Hungary is actually for all it complains about the EU, it actually [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1218.5s)]
*  takes money from the EU rather than gives it to it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1222.1s)]
*  So in the past, the EU has actually frozen some of the money that it gives to the EU for [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1225.54s)]
*  Orban's antics. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1231.3s)]
*  In 2022, it froze 30 billion in so-called cohesion and COVID recovery funds to Hungary [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1232.66s)]
*  due to concerns over alleged corruption, violations of academic freedom, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1239.38s)]
*  protections of LGBTQ plus rights, asylum rights, judicial independence, and other violations of [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1244.02s)]
*  basic EU laws. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1250.18s)]
*  But in December of 23, the commission released about 10 billion of that because Orban was [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1252.26s)]
*  standing in the way of Ukraine, money for Ukraine, military aid, economic aid, and the [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1257.06s)]
*  beginning of the accession talks. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1262.6599999999999s)]
*  So Orban has a lot of levers as well, but the EU has some levers. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1264.58s)]
*  The court itself has moral standing, but it doesn't have a lot of police power. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1268.1s)]
*  But the EU itself does give money to Hungary, so we'll see how this one plays out. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1274.1s)]
*  And we'll also see how much, you know, Orban's moves potentially reinforce others [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1278.1799999999998s)]
*  that might be like-minded. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1284.34s)]
*  There are sensitivities across, especially in Eastern countries in the EU, about migrant policy, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1285.7s)]
*  among other things. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1291.46s)]
*  And Slovakia has a populist-led government, for example, and is also close to the Ukraine [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1292.5800000000002s)]
*  theater of action and said positive things about Russia, among other things. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1299.46s)]
*  How much will Slovakia tweak the EU and taking inspiration from Hungary? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1302.74s)]
*  Or some of the other countries where we've seen continuing to see the gain of right-wing populists [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1307.7s)]
*  or coalitions in which they sit, countries like the Netherlands or other countries that [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1312.9s)]
*  are in a tough spot like Austria. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1317.14s)]
*  It's going to be a very interesting sort of period of time about whether it's just a [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1319.22s)]
*  outlier Hungary or whether there's a bunch of EU countries. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1323.3000000000002s)]
*  And you mentioned Germany facing its own concerns and its recent regional elections [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1326.5s)]
*  showing surprisingly sharp surge in far-right populist parties and a leftist populist party, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1332.26s)]
*  for that matter. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1338.1000000000001s)]
*  How much of this is going to affect the EU's ability to really enforce these policies? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1339.3s)]
*  Orban, of course, is... And there's less support for Putin, although in some in Slovakia, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1343.6999999999998s)]
*  there's less support for Putin, but those have been sort of the big two dividing lines, the [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1350.02s)]
*  asylum policy and Russia. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1355.46s)]
*  I think the EU's done an extraordinary job of holding together in its support for Ukraine [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1357.86s)]
*  in a way that certainly surprised the Russians and in many ways surprised Washington in their [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1361.9399999999998s)]
*  ability to hold together. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1368.4199999999998s)]
*  And they've had to do a mixture of bullying and jollying Orban along because [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1370.26s)]
*  Ukraine policy has been one of the things in which they've had to have a certain measure [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1376.1799999999998s)]
*  of unanimity, which has been the sort of weakness of EU governance and the strength. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1379.86s)]
*  Governments don't give up their sovereignty easily, and that's the way they make their [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1385.3799999999999s)]
*  decisions, at least on this particular issue. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1389.4599999999998s)]
*  But when he took over the rotating presidency, he was really in their face. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1392.5s)]
*  We talked about this. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1397.22s)]
*  Their slogan was, Miga, make Europe great again. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1398.82s)]
*  And then what did he do? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1402.5s)]
*  He took unauthorized trips to Moscow and Beijing, allegedly to negotiate some sort of a peace deal [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1403.46s)]
*  that was nobody else said you could go ahead and do this. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1408.58s)]
*  And there was some talk about boycotting his presidency. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1411.54s)]
*  They didn't do it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1414.02s)]
*  But if he starts busing migrants into Brussels, I think people may take another look at how [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1415.3s)]
*  they feel about his remaining months of this presidency. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1421.14s)]
*  People get pretty fed up with Viktor Orban. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1424.02s)]
*  See how many borders they get across with those buses, by the way. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1426.18s)]
*  And that's not a good look either, given the way the EU feels about borders and the way they feel [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1430.18s)]
*  about asylum. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1434.74s)]
*  This is, and I think Putin is going to sit back and enjoy every minute of it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1435.78s)]
*  Not a good look and not a good thing. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1439.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1442.66s)]
*  This is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1448.26s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1452.74s)]
*  And this week, they utterly surprised us. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1454.3400000000001s)]
*  There were so many others we expect them to choose. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1457.14s)]
*  And they selected China Gifts Cambodia to worships. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1460.02s)]
*  Why is China being so generous? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1464.82s)]
*  And why do you think they chose this one? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1466.42s)]
*  Ah, Chinese generosity. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1468.74s)]
*  It is interesting. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1470.26s)]
*  It is an interesting choice. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1470.98s)]
*  And it's again, sometimes it's the audience is looking at things and reacting to things in ways [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1472.42s)]
*  that we don't appreciate. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1478.18s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1481.8600000000001s)]
*  We may not understand. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1482.74s)]
*  We may not understand it. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1483.6200000000001s)]
*  We always appreciate it after it's been selected because we dig into it and say, ah, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1485.22s)]
*  but in this case, this seems to be part and parcel of China's playbook. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1489.46s)]
*  It's strategic playbook, part of the Belt and Road Initiative, part of its broader strategic [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1493.78s)]
*  playbook about keeping access to important sea lanes. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1498.34s)]
*  China gets vast amount of its trade through the sea. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1502.26s)]
*  And in the case of Cambodia, there are two ships known as Type 56 Corvettes. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1505.54s)]
*  They've been docked for months at the Riem Naval Base in Cambodia, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1511.14s)]
*  which is located on the Gulf of Thailand. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1514.8200000000002s)]
*  And Cambodia says they've been there because they've been taking part in training and joint [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1516.98s)]
*  military exercises. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1520.42s)]
*  And it was thinking, why shouldn't we procure these ships like this for our own Navy? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1522.1000000000001s)]
*  Keep in mind, China's been helping to develop this base and other facilities, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1526.98s)]
*  other military facilities for a nation that does not have currently have the capability to [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1531.0600000000002s)]
*  and the need for such bases. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1536.98s)]
*  It does not have any ships that currently would need such a base. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1538.9s)]
*  But lo and behold, China does. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1543.3000000000002s)]
*  And China is a very close, almost suffocatingly close ally of Cambodia. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1544.9s)]
*  And this is one of the early countries, early notches in the belt of the Belt and Road. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1549.46s)]
*  And so this is an opportunity for China to exert this influence. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1554.18s)]
*  And not only will China give these corvettes, but according to at least one Australian think tank [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1558.9s)]
*  analyst, Ewan Graham, China could be expected to retain a complement of naval officers on board [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1564.1s)]
*  the gifted corvettes. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1569.78s)]
*  And so what better way to continue to maintain this kind of influence nearby? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1571.1399999999999s)]
*  And maybe it becomes a prototype for other Chinese activities and other ports. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1575.62s)]
*  It's not clear to say other than that China has an extensive program for developing overseas [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1579.78s)]
*  ports that could have military capabilities as well as commercial ones. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1586.5s)]
*  Our colleague Zoe Liu has done an interactive piece that looks at this. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1590.34s)]
*  It is worldwide and it continues to grow. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1594.02s)]
*  And it's an ability of China's government to project its power globally and challenge the US [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1597.1399999999999s)]
*  in ways that has not been challenged in many years. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1602.26s)]
*  This is both for keeping influence over global supply chains, but also again, that ability to [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1605.22s)]
*  develop a port, the deep sea capabilities in which a military ship could be docked. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1610.1799999999998s)]
*  It may be docked for months at a time. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1614.58s)]
*  Maybe it's an allied country that might want to have a role in working with the Chinese military. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1616.5800000000002s)]
*  And in such ways, alliance with Chinese features develop that sort of tie. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1621.38s)]
*  Again, this seems to be the backdrop to this figure of the week, which is this quote unquote [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1626.26s)]
*  gift of two warships. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1631.54s)]
*  And they're just two corvettes, but a country that doesn't have them and is acquiring them and [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1633.14s)]
*  potentially acquiring them with Chinese officers involved and Chinese backing seems to set in [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1637.22s)]
*  motion a potentially a new approach by China to exert its influence. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1643.62s)]
*  So don't look and give Corvette in its mouth is what you're saying. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1646.7399999999998s)]
*  You've been waiting to say that. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1650.4199999999998s)]
*  It just actually came to me right now. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1652.6599999999999s)]
*  I have another question, which is as much as the Cambodians insist that their constitution [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1654.1s)]
*  doesn't allow them to have foreign military bases on their soil, et cetera, people are nervous [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1659.3799999999999s)]
*  about this. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1665.78s)]
*  And so we've had Lloyd Austin, who's gone there, our defense secretary has gone there. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1666.34s)]
*  And there have been other countries that have been testing how exclusive all of this is. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1669.94s)]
*  I gather the Australians tried to dock there and the two Japanese destroyers tried to go there and [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1674.02s)]
*  they were rerouted. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1680.8200000000002s)]
*  The Australians were a Navy frigate was rerouted. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1681.7s)]
*  So people are sort of testing and going in there. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1684.02s)]
*  So it's not that everyone's just taking this and they're testing and the Cambodians so far seem [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1686.18s)]
*  to be, shall we say, respecting their patrons. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1691.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1695.7s)]
*  Again, their previous ruler, Hun Sen and his son now seem to be in lockstep. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1696.34s)]
*  They tend to do China's bidding and meetings of ASEAN, the regional grouping, and are just very [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1701.06s)]
*  tight. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1706.82s)]
*  And they are part, in addition to things like providing convenient port space, they are beholden [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1707.1399999999999s)]
*  to Chinese infrastructure development, which is seen as one of the downside. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1713.9399999999998s)]
*  And you have a number of countries chafing at some of this Chinese investment because it's become [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1717.62s)]
*  known as debt diplomacy, where they rack up huge debt and China's got them over a barrel. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1721.1399999999999s)]
*  And has other ways of exerting influence. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1726.1799999999998s)]
*  Cambodia, tiny country, it's been under China's sway for a long time. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1728.4199999999998s)]
*  And this is just a new sort of chapter in that by all accounts. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1733.06s)]
*  It's worth noting that the US actually had been involved in plans to refurbish this base, the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1736.82s)]
*  base in question, at the request of Cambodia. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1741.6999999999998s)]
*  But then further contacts were had with China, apparently, and that was scrapped and the few [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1744.6599999999999s)]
*  buildings that had been made were demolished and they went ahead with the Chinese base [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1748.98s)]
*  construction plan. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1753.2199999999998s)]
*  So this is the anchoring of Cambodia and the China orbit, I guess, is why this is a [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1754.02s)]
*  figure of the week. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsF2p-76C6A&t=1758.34s)]
