# Ukraine Tries To Halt Russian Advance, Biden Woos Kenya, the Fate of Assange, and More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M)
*  In the coming week, Ukraine struggles to defend its front lines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. President Biden hosts Kenya's President Ruto for a state visit, and London's High [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=5.0s)]
*  Court decides the fate of Julian Assange. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=9.36s)]
*  It's May 16, 2024, in time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=27.6s)]
*  And I'm Karl-Anne Robbins. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=29.0s)]
*  Karla, we're going to have to start in Ukraine, a familiar spot, because of new fluid on-the-ground [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=30.0s)]
*  developments there on the front lines. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=37.04s)]
*  Over the past weekend, Russia launched a new offensive that focused on the northeast, away [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  from the usual southern and southeastern front lines. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=44.66s)]
*  Russian troops have overtaken several villages just outside of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=47.52s)]
*  city. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  The United States and other Western countries have pledged significant military aid packages. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  We just had Secretary Blinken doing the same in Kyiv. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=58.04s)]
*  But will Ukraine be able to hold out and be able to sort of integrate this weaponry before [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  the situation on the ground changes? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=67.92s)]
*  Bob, the hope was with USAID flowing, Ukraine could use this year to rebuild its forces, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=69.6s)]
*  and the line was, hold this year, rebuild, and in 2025, once again, go on the offensive. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=75.64s)]
*  But the enemy gets a say. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=82.08s)]
*  And as you said, since last Friday, Russian forces have mounted several major pushes, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=83.82s)]
*  not just in the northeast, but on all of Ukraine's front lines, most notably near Kharkiv, the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  country's second-largest city with more than a million residents. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  And analysts were describing it as the most relentless advance since the beginning of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  the war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=102.3s)]
*  Yesterday, the Ukrainians said that advance had slowed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=103.3s)]
*  But we need to emphasize how uncertain the situation really is. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=106.28s)]
*  And some analysts are warning that the Russians may be trying to take villages within artillery [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  range of Kharkiv so they can set up a siege pounding and pounding the city. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=113.5s)]
*  The biggest concern is that the Ukrainians had to move troops from the south and further [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=118.9s)]
*  east, which has left them vulnerable to a major assault on the Donbass, which Russia [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=123.34s)]
*  has claimed but does not control. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=127.94s)]
*  They're really, really overstretched. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  And Zelensky is talking about that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=132.74s)]
*  He went up to Kharkiv today. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=134.14s)]
*  And basically, they're being pushed on all fronts. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=135.62s)]
*  Yesterday, there were reports the Russians had launched a major new attack on the village [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=138.86s)]
*  of Rovetein in the south, a place we've talked about. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=142.46s)]
*  This was one of the few places that Ukraine managed to recapture during last summer's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=145.9s)]
*  failed counteroffensive. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=149.46s)]
*  And the Russian's defense ministry was claiming that they were in full control. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=150.46s)]
*  The Ukrainians say not. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=153.66s)]
*  But it's really a mess. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=155.78s)]
*  And what the last few days more than anything else have shown us is just how much of a beating [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=157.54s)]
*  the Ukrainians took while the Republicans in the House dithered and held up USAID for [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=161.42s)]
*  more than half a year. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=166.3s)]
*  We talked about that 10 to 1 advantage in artillery that the Russians had. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=168.02s)]
*  And we're also seeing Ukraine's huge weakness in air defenses, which means the Russians [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=172.66s)]
*  can fly and drop glide bombs pretty much without any fear of getting shut down. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=176.62s)]
*  The Russians also used the last six months to build up their numbers and apparently to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=181.58s)]
*  improve their electronic warfare capabilities, figuring out how to take out Western-supplied [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=185.86s)]
*  drones, which has long been a Ukrainian advantage. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=190.66000000000003s)]
*  And apparently they're even confusing the targeting of missiles and pretty sophisticated [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=194.34s)]
*  missiles that the US and NATO has been supplying. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=198.18s)]
*  US officials say the Ukrainians should be able to push back once the full package of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  aid starts arriving. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=205.9s)]
*  And Tony Blinken, who made the surprise visit that you mentioned, Bob, and announced two [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=207.18s)]
*  billion in equipment is going to be rushed there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=211.96s)]
*  But what does rush really mean? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=214.18s)]
*  Ukrainians also finally passed a new conscription law to bring in younger troops. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=217.3s)]
*  But that too is going to take several months for them to get ready. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=220.66s)]
*  So the question more than anything else is the one you post in the beginning of this, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=223.46s)]
*  Bob, is how long can they hold on right here and whether or how much territory they may [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=227.02s)]
*  lose while they build up their forces and get this aid in? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=232.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think the speed of the latest round of developments has been particularly alarming. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=237.58s)]
*  And I talked to just a few of the Ukraine hands around here at CFR, and they are also [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  very worried about what they see as a tide that seems hard to push back against, at least [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=247.36s)]
*  given the time that's going to be needed to be able to onboard new equipment, new defense [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=252.98s)]
*  capabilities, new missile defense capabilities. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=258.02s)]
*  And these glide bombs, this is a Russian innovation, crude but effective. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=260.5s)]
*  And I think it points to that the Russians have been iterating and working on their approach. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=264.02s)]
*  And yes, they have the ability to recruit a lot more people, and they have been described [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=269.46s)]
*  as cannon fodder. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=273.46s)]
*  Putin has the advantage of not really having to care about that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=274.46s)]
*  Starting a new term as we were taping this podcast, he just arrived in China. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=278.26s)]
*  He's so far getting a strong shot in the arm from China in terms of encouraging comments [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=282.7s)]
*  and language. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=287.14s)]
*  The other thing that strikes me in this latest offensive, Carla, is that Kharkiv, this is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  a heavily Russian affiliated part of Ukraine. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=292.14s)]
*  Many of them are Russian speakers. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=295.46s)]
*  They have relatives in Russia, and they're just pounding it relentlessly. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=296.46s)]
*  They're hitting civilian targets. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=300.62s)]
*  And it's sort of the narrative about that has seemed to have been lost. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  Russia's allowed to go out and claim they're pursuing their denazification campaign, this [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  ridiculous charge. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=309.62s)]
*  And they're not getting called on it, or at least not consistently enough. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=311.16s)]
*  So that's frustrating. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=314.72s)]
*  And then they're just giving them the sheer firepower to be able to respond, to defend [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=316.22s)]
*  themselves. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=320.16s)]
*  And something you've touched on a lot, which is the self-restraint that they- [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=321.36s)]
*  The self-deterrence. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=326.36s)]
*  The self-deterrence, I should say, yes, that's being exercised because NATO partners, the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=328.36s)]
*  United States, don't want to cross some of Putin's red lines. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  Putin continues to dangle a nuclear option out there whenever there's talk of ramping [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=337.28s)]
*  up Western support in terms of boots on the ground, let's say, or capabilities that could [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  probe into Russia. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  So the Ukrainians are really boxed in at this point. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's going to be something we're going to have to watch on a daily basis. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  But particularly, they need some sort of a ramping up of air defense capabilities that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  are just not there right now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=360.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, Zelensky was saying, just pointing to Kharkiv, and we could really use two new Patriot [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=361.55999999999995s)]
*  batteries right now to stop what they're pounding them with. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=366.12s)]
*  But if the situation gets even more desperate, and it's pretty desperate right now, the debate, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=370.0s)]
*  I think, is going to settle into two camps. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=375.32s)]
*  And you already see these two camps developing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=380.52s)]
*  Do we now talk about what's the negotiated settlement? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=383.6s)]
*  And do we have to tell the Ukrainians that they have to negotiate, something that we [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=387.82s)]
*  haven't done, at least publicly? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=391.68s)]
*  Or are we going to go the other route, which Macron has been talking about and the Balts [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=394.4s)]
*  have been talking about, sending troops of some form, or at least giving them much more [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=399.64s)]
*  license? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=406.44s)]
*  Let's stop self-deterring. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=407.44s)]
*  I mean, are the Brits talking about it? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=408.44s)]
*  They've already given them license to use British-applied equipment to hit inside of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=410.96s)]
*  Russia. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, why do the Russians get to fly in, drop these glide bombs, and we're all saying, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  you can't use that equipment to push back against them? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=420.12s)]
*  And also, the point that Zelensky raised, all of these allied countries coming in to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=422.96s)]
*  protect Israel from the air during the Iranian attack. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  We may have this sort of trickling in or even pushing in equipment, but still months to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  come. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=437.56s)]
*  I mean, if Ukraine is on the verge, I don't want to use the term, but if things are that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=438.56s)]
*  bad, we may have to have a major shift in how we think about supplying this country [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  and how this war is fought, or go in the other direction. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=447.2s)]
*  I personally am in the camp of let's think about a different way of how this war is fought, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=450.56s)]
*  because I don't want to see Ukraine destroyed. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=455.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=457.96s)]
*  And at the same time, it does make you wonder whether there is anything being pursued in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=458.96s)]
*  terms of an off-ramp for this or pause or anything. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=463.52s)]
*  It certainly doesn't seem like it, but what does that even look like? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=467.32s)]
*  And is it just things are just too hot right now? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=471.24s)]
*  Russians feel like they have an ability to change facts on the ground, for example. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=474.76s)]
*  So I think it's about digging in and then potentially changing the calculus. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=479.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  But again, it's a tough one. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  I think Blinken has settled the right things, but at the same time, the alliance is in a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  really tough spot right now, and Russia seems to be seizing all of the areas of initiative, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=490.84s)]
*  even while it has its own weaknesses that people shouldn't lose sight of. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=496.4s)]
*  People in the Congress acted as if somehow were a video game far off. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=500.9s)]
*  These are real people dying, a real war that could be potentially lost. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=506.12s)]
*  Enormous stakes. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes, Russia has its allies. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=512.6s)]
*  North Korea, Iran, China, which the Congress is hugely concerned about, perhaps too concerned [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=514.96s)]
*  about. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=520.56s)]
*  Are those the allies that we want to succeed here? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=521.8s)]
*  Bob, let's bring the conversation to Washington. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=524.76s)]
*  Next Thursday, May 24th, President Biden is going to be hosting Kenyan President William [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=529.64s)]
*  Ruto for a state visit. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=534.04s)]
*  And this is the first state visit, this is sort of extraordinary, by an African leader [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=536.16s)]
*  in more than 15 years. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=540.0s)]
*  The last visit was for President John Kufour of Ghana. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=541.86s)]
*  And now most of Biden's state and official visits so far have been for close allies like [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=545.9399999999999s)]
*  India and Japan, Australia, South Korea, and France. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=549.9599999999999s)]
*  Why now? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=553.52s)]
*  Why Kenya? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  And I gather also that Ruto has not been invited to address Congress despite a lot of pressure [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=557.04s)]
*  from law-makers on Johnson to extend that invitation as well. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  Yes, I think in terms of why, let's say why Kenya, Kenya makes a lot of sense for this [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=566.36s)]
*  type of a visit. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=571.7199999999999s)]
*  This is one of the closest allies US has actually in Africa. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=572.8399999999999s)]
*  It's marking its big round number of their relationship, 60 years of the US-Kenyan relationship. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=576.78s)]
*  And Kenya has been involved in lots of areas that the US deems as important at a time when [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=582.5s)]
*  there have been some backsliding and real defeats, I would say, for US on the African [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=589.64s)]
*  content in terms of its projection of power and influence. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=594.3s)]
*  We should note, and there was a big, much noted Washington Post interview with the Prime [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=598.5s)]
*  Minister of Niger, the coup-installed Prime Minister of Niger this week about him saying [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=602.88s)]
*  that the US tried to strong-arm its way to maintaining military base in the country and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=608.12s)]
*  gave an ultimatum. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=612.08s)]
*  And US officials have denied that, but still in all, it's a bit of an ignominious departure. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=613.56s)]
*  The US is now in the preps for some pretty important bases that were seen as counterterror [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=618.16s)]
*  hubs in West Africa. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=623.24s)]
*  It's also kind of retreating from its position, the temporary perhaps or not, from Chad, which [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  just had some dubious elections in which the status quo was upheld. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=631.36s)]
*  In the period of time in which there have been a number of coups and a number of sort [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=635.6s)]
*  of new power structures coming up that are embracing Russia, China has already been present [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  in its own way, including by the way in Kenya, where the Belt and Road program has some major [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=644.68s)]
*  initiatives. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=649.4799999999999s)]
*  But Kenya has been a sturdy ally to the US, not that they don't have their differences, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=650.68s)]
*  but let's just take a case in point. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=655.3199999999999s)]
*  The forthcoming deployment of a Kenyan mission of about a thousand peacekeepers or police [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=658.0s)]
*  units in Haiti, which is coming at an extremely perilous time for Haiti. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=663.52s)]
*  We have been talked recently about the gangs sort of taking over huge swaths of the capital. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  There's now an interim leadership install there, but a key part of that upholding that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=673.48s)]
*  is a peacekeeping contingent. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=677.04s)]
*  The US has pledged something like $300 million to help support that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=679.6s)]
*  I think Kenya would like to hear more about what sort of support it's going to get for [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=683.04s)]
*  that endeavor and sort of talk about cementing their existence there. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  So there's a security element. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  They're also working together to help in East Africa where al-Shabaab remains active. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=692.66s)]
*  The US would like to maintain a base in Kenya and eyes on the ground in that part of the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=697.76s)]
*  world. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=703.04s)]
*  Ethiopia had been thought of until the last couple of years as another hub, a stable hub, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=704.04s)]
*  and that's certainly no longer the case. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=708.92s)]
*  So Kenya's emerged even more so as an important actor in the region. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=710.48s)]
*  So I think they want to talk about the African element, but also this is a time of the US [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=714.04s)]
*  discussing renewing an African free trade agreement that Kenya certainly would dearly [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=718.72s)]
*  love to see renewed. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=723.6s)]
*  It's known probably most often in the US market for the appearance of Kenyan-made apparel [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=725.1s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=730.88s)]
*  They'd like to expand that though. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=732.1999999999999s)]
*  There's going to be a prominent appearance at the US Chamber of Commerce by Ruto. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  There's going to be also appearances at other factories and things. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=736.4s)]
*  So it's a business trip. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=739.8s)]
*  It's a security related trip. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=741.8399999999999s)]
*  It's an important time for the US to signal in meaningful ways that it actually has, it [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=743.36s)]
*  can be a partner and it can be a partner in ways that benefit the African side of the [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  partnership and not just sort of this bit of a crude security transaction that we have [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=753.12s)]
*  sometimes seen in the past. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=758.48s)]
*  And there's all been this huge criticism. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=760.0s)]
*  The United States is ceding Africa to the Chinese and to the Russians and to a great [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=762.32s)]
*  sense ceding Latin America as well. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=768.64s)]
*  So much of life is showing up. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=770.84s)]
*  But I think Kenya's really interesting the fact that they are part of the Belt and Road [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=772.9200000000001s)]
*  Initiative, but at the same time they're cooperating with the United States sending this peacekeeping [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=775.84s)]
*  mission. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=779.96s)]
*  They seem to be quite adept at balancing. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=780.96s)]
*  But my impression, he went to China. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=783.36s)]
*  Didn't he go on a visit to China recently? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=786.08s)]
*  He did. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=788.24s)]
*  Yeah, last year. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=789.28s)]
*  I believe he went towards the end of last year as well. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=790.28s)]
*  So certainly keeping their options open. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=792.6800000000001s)]
*  And again, it shows the Chinese deftness in the way they are working towards maintaining [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=794.44s)]
*  ties. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=799.08s)]
*  They too have visits of heads of state and government coming from Africa. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=800.08s)]
*  And again, this trade agreement I mentioned, these kinds of things are important. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=804.96s)]
*  It shows what are the benefits these countries get by sort of being in the US embrace, which [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=808.24s)]
*  also can include some strong language when they are seen as wandering from their commitments [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=814.0400000000001s)]
*  to human rights or democracy and so forth. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=820.08s)]
*  Again, democracy has been on the retreat in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=822.32s)]
*  And these new coup-installed leaderships and heavily sort of military-influenced leaderships [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=826.72s)]
*  just don't want to hear about the US wagging their fingers at them. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=832.64s)]
*  They have no problem turning to mercenary groups like Wagner to help prop up their positions [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=836.0s)]
*  in power. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=840.82s)]
*  And they're not mindful towards the importance of setting up free and fair elections for [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=842.26s)]
*  the way forward as long as they can then, there's a quid pro quo for allowing Western [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=846.78s)]
*  parties to do their bidding on the continent. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=852.8199999999999s)]
*  France has also, I think, taken a hit in parts of Africa as well where it had sway. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=855.18s)]
*  So there's definitely this change going on. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=859.46s)]
*  Publics in Africa though would still like to have less corrupt and functional governments. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=862.46s)]
*  There's a real problem across Africa of brain drain going on. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=867.42s)]
*  And so I think at the end of the day, it would serve them better, these countries better [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=870.66s)]
*  to be in a closer partnership with the US, but the US just has to show more. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=874.1s)]
*  And again, this first state visit in 15 years, there's a demonstration effect and maybe they [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=878.1s)]
*  can build on it, Carla. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  And we will have to keep an eye on this Haiti mission. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=884.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  The US is down there building barracks for these troops at the airport. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=887.9399999999999s)]
*  And I gather that these Kenyan officers were called back from leave this week. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=893.18s)]
*  So it looks like they're going to be there in the next few weeks. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=897.4599999999999s)]
*  So we'll have a lot to talk about there. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=899.98s)]
*  I don't think this is militarily going to be all that challenging, but from a police [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=902.14s)]
*  point of view, I think it could be really potentially quite dangerous both for the Kenyans [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=907.0600000000001s)]
*  and for the Haitians. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=912.28s)]
*  So we'll have to watch that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=913.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=914.28s)]
*  It's very much an experiment. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=915.28s)]
*  The Haitians deserve to have a strong sort of international coalition trying to help [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=916.62s)]
*  them. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=921.0600000000001s)]
*  The Kenyans deserve to have their backs supported by strong partners like the US and some UN [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=922.0600000000001s)]
*  partners. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=928.1s)]
*  This is a very important experiment for a really a failed state at this point. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=929.22s)]
*  So yes, I think it's going to be worth watching as of this month. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=933.38s)]
*  By the end of the month, it's going to be the first deployment. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=936.66s)]
*  Carla, I'm going to move us back over to London where next Monday, London's High Court is [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=938.66s)]
*  going to decide whether the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange can be extradited to the United [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=944.98s)]
*  States. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=949.9s)]
*  Assange has been in a longstanding legal battle ever since he released hundreds of thousands [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=950.9s)]
*  of classified US military documents that related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=955.4s)]
*  So what does it mean if Assange is actually sent to stand trial in the United States? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=961.68s)]
*  There are a lot of uncertainties here. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=965.8s)]
*  Will this British High Court decide to extradite him? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=968.62s)]
*  Will the European Court of Human Rights intervene to stop the extradition if that decision is [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=972.48s)]
*  made? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=977.8s)]
*  And if he's put on a US military transport and sent to the US, will there be some sort [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=979.4s)]
*  of a plea deal? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=983.28s)]
*  His reports, potentially they could change the charges to mishandling of classified documents. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=984.44s)]
*  The Biden administration sent a host of mixed signals about its plans for Assange last month [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=991.0400000000001s)]
*  after speaking with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=995.08s)]
*  Assange is an Australian citizen. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  Biden said the US was considering dropping its prosecution altogether. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1000.6s)]
*  But then to win Assange's extradition, the US sent assurances to the British High Court [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1004.84s)]
*  he would not face the death penalty, that he could seek protections under the First [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1010.96s)]
*  Amendment, which doesn't sound like they plan to drop the case altogether. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1014.36s)]
*  So far, Assange is facing 18 charges nearly all under the Espionage Act, which is brought [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1019.32s)]
*  by the Trump Justice Department. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1024.8400000000001s)]
*  And at least on paper, these charges could mean a sentence of 175 years in prison, but [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1028.24s)]
*  legal experts are predicting something close to four to six years if he were convicted. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1033.3600000000001s)]
*  As for why this all matters, Assange is no hero in my book, and there seems little doubt [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1038.52s)]
*  that he was a willing or very convenient collaborator with Russian intelligence when he published [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1044.04s)]
*  these hacked DNC emails during the 2016 presidential campaign. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1048.6399999999999s)]
*  But that's not this case. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1053.4s)]
*  That's not the WikiLeaks case here. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1054.96s)]
*  What he is on trial for is committing journalism. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  He's been indicted for obtaining and disclosing sensitive information that was undeniably [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1060.12s)]
*  in the public interest, including dossiers of prisoners held in Guantanamo without trial, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1064.34s)]
*  reports that showed civilian casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq were far higher than [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1069.58s)]
*  official US government estimates, and I could just go on. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1073.3s)]
*  And if he were convicted, even then, this is the first time in our history someone would [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1077.1399999999999s)]
*  be put on trial for publishing information under the Espionage Act. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1081.3s)]
*  You know, until now, the government only went after the officials who leaked the classified [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1085.06s)]
*  documents or the spies who stole them, not the people who published them. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1089.26s)]
*  So is he a journalist? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1093.78s)]
*  He certainly wasn't a good or responsible person in this case. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1095.62s)]
*  When he and WikiLeaks first worked with the Times and the Guardian of Britain and Der [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1100.3s)]
*  Spiegel on the WikiLeaks documents, these documents were carefully redacted to take [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1103.98s)]
*  out the names of anybody who could get hurt. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1109.78s)]
*  And then he turned around and dumped completely unredacted documents on the net, which was [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1111.98s)]
*  extremely dangerous and irresponsible. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1117.3s)]
*  He's not a great guy. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1119.3799999999999s)]
*  That said, bringing him to trial under the Espionage Act for committing journalism is [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1121.1s)]
*  very dangerous for you, for me, for every journalist we know, Bob. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1126.02s)]
*  So if he's extradited, I certainly hope the Biden administration drops the case. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1130.58s)]
*  It is chilling to think that he's going to do it with the stipulation that he is no hero [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1135.74s)]
*  in my book. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1139.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1140.78s)]
*  I mean, whenever you start to peel the layers on the Assange case, it's just this trouble [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1141.78s)]
*  starts with his own kind of character and comportment, certainly. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1148.16s)]
*  And there's the principle of the thing, though, as you mentioned, Carla, and it makes you [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1152.52s)]
*  wonder whether there's a way out of this that includes time served in a way in terms of [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1155.5600000000002s)]
*  him being a kind of a limbo for a number of years, maybe as part of it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1161.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1165.24s)]
*  The official efforts against him are hard to kind of glean at this point. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1167.0800000000002s)]
*  It revved up under the Trump administration, I think, and then the Biden administration [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1171.52s)]
*  has it in its hands. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1175.64s)]
*  And I wouldn't be surprised if they find some way to soft pedal this a little bit more and [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1176.96s)]
*  not level him with a firm charge. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1182.24s)]
*  But I'm not sure how that figures into the extradition necessarily, or whether there's [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1184.3200000000002s)]
*  some sort of deal involved. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1187.24s)]
*  It's a bit beyond my ken legally what they can do. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1188.68s)]
*  I'm not sure why they've pushed this forward because the Obama administration, as furious [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1191.48s)]
*  as they were, didn't charge him. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1196.1200000000001s)]
*  This was under the Trump administration and they kept ginning up the charges, actually. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1198.3000000000002s)]
*  They didn't start out with these espionage charges. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1202.36s)]
*  And as I said, this would be the first time you'd go after someone for publishing classified [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1205.6399999999999s)]
*  documents under the Espionage Act. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1210.8799999999999s)]
*  This hasn't been done before. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  And this is also the Biden administration, which has rolled back some of the worst restrictions [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1214.4399999999998s)]
*  that the Trump administration did, some of the worst things they did to go after journalists. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1220.8999999999999s)]
*  Garland in October of 22 issued new regulations that would ban the use of subpoenas and warrants [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1224.8799999999999s)]
*  to seize reporters' communications. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1230.96s)]
*  We found out that the Trump administration had secretly gone after the records of a bunch [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  of reporters, reporters for CNN and the Post and the Times. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1238.1599999999999s)]
*  This was not a happy relationship with the press and the Trump administration. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1242.08s)]
*  So why, after claiming that they were going to champion the First Amendment and freedom [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1246.3999999999999s)]
*  of the press, why they are going forward with this is beyond me. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1252.08s)]
*  And I think, as I said, it's chilling for all journalists if they push this one, no [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1255.36s)]
*  matter how you feel about Assange and WikiLeak and hacking the DNC and his irresponsibility [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1259.68s)]
*  for dumping the unredacted on this. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1266.0800000000002s)]
*  In this case, there really is a principle involved. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1269.0s)]
*  Again, another important case that has drifted for a while, but we could have some clarity [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  on next week, Carla. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1276.48s)]
*  So for the reasons you cited, really worth watching closely for people in our business [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1277.48s)]
*  and elsewhere. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1281.4s)]
*  It's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1283.24s)]
*  This is the figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1287.9199999999998s)]
*  Instagram story. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1292.32s)]
*  And this week, Bob, our audience selected the one that you and I very much wanted them [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  to select, which is 10,000 plus protests, Georgia's foreign agents bill. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1297.8799999999999s)]
*  This is a bill that looks like it was written in Moscow, the term foreign agent to label [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1303.6s)]
*  journalists and dissidents and go after them. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1309.08s)]
*  Is this the end of democracy in Georgia and the end of Georgia's chances of joining the [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1312.22s)]
*  EU and NATO? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1315.72s)]
*  Well, I think the sustained size and passion of the protests show that there's very much [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1318.6000000000001s)]
*  concern that it is, especially among young Georgians. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1324.68s)]
*  And you see the young people involved in demonstrating and in organizing these protests is pretty [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1327.28s)]
*  astounding. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1333.2s)]
*  The Georgian dream after coming in as seen as an antidote to some pretty corrupt and [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1334.48s)]
*  even authoritarian minded previous Georgian governments has itself turned into a very [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1340.44s)]
*  disturbingly towards a pro-Moscow unit. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1346.3s)]
*  There were comments that came out from their leaders, both the prime minister and the power [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1348.9s)]
*  behind the scenes, Bidzina Ivanishvili, the wealthiest man in the country that sounded [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1352.82s)]
*  like Moscow talking points, Kremlin talking points about not pursuing this legislation [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1358.62s)]
*  would open up the country to the Western designs to turn it into another front against Russia. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1363.62s)]
*  They decried the way the West has supported Ukraine and so forth. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1369.46s)]
*  And it's a piece of legislation that, as you say, echoes what Russia did about 2012 or [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1374.66s)]
*  so Russia used this legislation to basically turn around and swiftly and comprehensively [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1380.1000000000001s)]
*  stifled sent curb independent media clamp down systematically on any voices of independence [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1387.7s)]
*  on a whole host of things, but especially as we've seen most recently on the war in [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1395.18s)]
*  Ukraine, which are not allowed to call war. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1398.6200000000001s)]
*  It's a law that basically says media outlets, NGOs, any or other nonprofits have to register [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1401.1799999999998s)]
*  as, quote, pursuing the interests of a foreign power if they get more than 20% of their funding [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1407.26s)]
*  from abroad, which is what many of them do. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1412.5s)]
*  Now the president of Georgia, Salome Zurabishvili, has said she would veto the legislation, but [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1415.1399999999999s)]
*  she does not and her supporters do not have the votes in parliament to sustain that view. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1420.5s)]
*  So that could be overturned if she goes that route, which she's supposed to do within 10 [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1425.3s)]
*  days of the vote, which was just a couple of days ago. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1429.26s)]
*  So we're looking like an ongoing power struggle here that seems to be going in the direction [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1432.22s)]
*  of George and dream. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1437.94s)]
*  Now, a year ago, this came up and it was paused. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1438.94s)]
*  This bill came up. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1441.22s)]
*  There are elections this October that speculation goes that the Georgian dream forces, the pro [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1442.66s)]
*  Russian forces are trying to get this all in place before those elections so they can [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1449.78s)]
*  really sort of stack the decks in their favor and say, look, we have a democratically elected [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1453.18s)]
*  government that's deciding to go our own way and not align ourselves with the West. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1458.74s)]
*  What's interesting also though, is that even some of the Georgian dream legislators themselves [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1462.78s)]
*  had spoken and not too distant past about the pro EU orientation and the accession process [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1467.54s)]
*  that was just starting in favorable ways. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1473.42s)]
*  One line of analysis is that as some of the Georgian dream officials, especially those [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1476.82s)]
*  closest to the oligarch, even Israeli have been concerned about how the EU accession [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1481.7s)]
*  process would start to compromise their sort of ability to gain revenues and their ability [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1488.7s)]
*  to pull levers and so forth. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1494.9s)]
*  Basically because it's EU accession is about sort of solidifying rule of law and anti-corruption [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1496.94s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1502.66s)]
*  I hate when that happens. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1503.66s)]
*  And that challenges special interests. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1505.06s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1506.58s)]
*  That's what happens. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1507.58s)]
*  I mean, I recall living in the Czech Republic when they were part of the accession process [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1508.58s)]
*  and that was hugely supported in that country. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1512.5s)]
*  But there was also a great deal of resentment over some of the things that started rolling [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1515.2s)]
*  out some of the laws, what they call these chapters and the EU is trying to close various [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1518.66s)]
*  chapters and the countries get in. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1522.76s)]
*  Now the Czechs have since then benefited grandly from EU law, as have the Hungarians, by the [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1524.68s)]
*  way, which are the big, the fly in the EU ointment continuously as we've discussed [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1529.48s)]
*  in this podcast. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1533.76s)]
*  But we're at a time now where the countries are taking sides. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1535.16s)]
*  Kyrgyzstan has its own foreign agents law. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1539.1200000000001s)]
*  There are aspects of a sort of a foreign agents list that Kazakhstan is reportedly keeping. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1541.8s)]
*  As I said, Russia has its law. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1547.2s)]
*  We have also ferment, totally unrelated, but ferment happening in Armenia over the way [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1549.8s)]
*  their leadership is pursuing possible peace and border deal with the Azerbaijan forces [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1555.12s)]
*  there. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1559.76s)]
*  And then to add even further instability potentially to the broader region, we just had this week [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1561.18s)]
*  an attempted assassination of the prime minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1566.84s)]
*  He has said at latest report to be recovering. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1571.56s)]
*  He was shot multiple times. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1574.28s)]
*  It's going to seemingly be a long recovery. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1575.9199999999998s)]
*  And we don't know whether that's going to lead to reprisals by a also Moscow leaning [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1578.28s)]
*  government against opposition forces. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1583.04s)]
*  So we're looking at a landscape now, a real challenge in the region. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1585.54s)]
*  Georgia itself certainly should be discussed in and of itself because this is a country [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1589.56s)]
*  that I do think the public yearns for this orientation. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1594.34s)]
*  There's many parallels actually to what we saw in Ukraine in 2014 with the Maidan protests [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1602.9599999999998s)]
*  But still in all, there's a broader set of things happening in the region. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1604.22s)]
*  And so yet again, you talk about the stakes of what's involved and it's countries ability [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1608.36s)]
*  to decide their own destiny, their own sovereignty and not be aligned with a sort of a gangster [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1612.36s)]
*  run complex that is the way that Russia likes to sort of keep things going in these places. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1618.08s)]
*  We should also note finally that Russia is in control of about 20% of Georgian territory. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1623.82s)]
*  These two separatist regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia are under Russia's sway now. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1629.46s)]
*  I happened to be in Georgia about five years ago on a wonderful trip. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1634.34s)]
*  I mean, we drove not far from the border with South Ossetia and Georgians told us that basically [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1638.06s)]
*  every year Russians move the fences further and further into Georgia from South Ossetia. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1643.8999999999999s)]
*  And it's sort of a defiant way of just sort of showing where they are. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1649.54s)]
*  There was a 2008 mini war we should note where the Russians came in and routed the Georgians [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1654.86s)]
*  and that is certainly on people's minds as well. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1659.6599999999999s)]
*  So a lot of concern and back to your original question, a lot at stake. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1662.18s)]
*  Of course, this is one of these things you can never prove. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1666.42s)]
*  But one of the great thought exercises is had the George W. Bush administration stood [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1669.02s)]
*  up more forcefully for Georgia in 2008, had the Obama administration stood up more forcefully [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1675.5s)]
*  for Ukraine in 2014, would we not be in this situation in Ukraine now? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1680.3s)]
*  It's not like the Russians didn't telegraph it. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1686.5s)]
*  And with that thought, Bob. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1688.98s)]
*  And so that's another look at the turbulent world next week, Carla. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmUOwa6tD8M&t=1690.7s)]
