# TWNW Special What to Read This Summer 2024
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU)
*  Welcome to the World Next Week's special summer reading episode. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=5.2s)]
*  And I'm Carly Ann Robbins. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=6.72s)]
*  Every year we look forward to discussing books we've read and plan to read as well as other [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=20.2s)]
*  media we recommend for what we hope are these slightly more relaxed summer months. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=24.0s)]
*  And joining us today from Berlin for this summer reading podcast special is our old [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=28.84s)]
*  friend Deborah Amos. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=33.08s)]
*  Deb is a professor, author, and of course an award-winning international correspondent [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=35.12s)]
*  for NPR, where her coverage of the Middle East and refugee issues is unparalleled. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=39.08s)]
*  She's now the Ferris Professor of Journalism in Residence at Princeton University. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Deb, welcome back to the show. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=48.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=50.04s)]
*  And I'm former NPR, but a small quibble. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=51.04s)]
*  I am a professor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=53.56s)]
*  You will always be NPR in my heart. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=55.84s)]
*  And just a reminder to listeners that our summer reading show, which we do annually, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=59.44s)]
*  does not feature the work of our CFR colleagues, although they are prolific and distinguished. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=64.04s)]
*  And we do highlight CFR publications all year long on our usual programming. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=69.68s)]
*  Today we'd like to spotlight those authors and creators outside of CFR. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=73.52s)]
*  So Deb is our guest. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=77.56s)]
*  You get first dibs on sharing a book you've read that you want us to know more about. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=79.04s)]
*  So the first thing I'm going to admit is I listen to books and I do it a lot. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=83.0s)]
*  I mean, when I have to underline, of course I don't, but for the most part, I listen to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=87.64s)]
*  them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=91.2s)]
*  So that is also in my calculations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=92.2s)]
*  What I did over the last couple of weeks is I wanted to listen to both Pulitzer Prize [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=94.0s)]
*  winners fiction and nonfiction. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=100.28s)]
*  So I'll start with the fiction. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=102.56s)]
*  Night Watch by Jane Anne Phillips is a mother daughter story, takes place in what is then [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=103.92s)]
*  called a lunatic asylum. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=109.04s)]
*  But what is startling about this book is it's about the chaos after the Civil War. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=111.12s)]
*  So it takes place between 1864 and 1874. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=117.04s)]
*  And I'd never thought about that before, about how crazy it was. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  People would show up, they'd move into your house, there was nothing you could do about [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=125.54s)]
*  it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=128.6s)]
*  There was hardly any law enforcement. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=129.6s)]
*  It's just a cracking good read with a very good narrator. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=131.08s)]
*  The second thing I did is I listened to the nonfiction and that one is A Day in the Life [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=134.88s)]
*  of Abd Salama. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=141.8s)]
*  It was a tough one for Nathan Thrall. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  It's a story about a Palestinian bus accident where children are, the bus is hit by an out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=148.16s)]
*  of control truck and a lot of the children are killed, the bus explodes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  And the book comes out right after October 7th. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  We all remember that date. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=164.83999999999997s)]
*  It is when Hamas goes on the rampage in southern Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  And so Nathan's book tour gets canceled everywhere he is. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=170.4s)]
*  But it is a remarkable story and it tells a story about Palestinians in remarkable detail. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=175.56s)]
*  How they lived, what it is like to live under occupation. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=183.84s)]
*  And he was a surprise this year for it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=187.96s)]
*  There was a book talk here in Berlin. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=190.28s)]
*  And as we were all drinking bad wine, as one does after a book talk, Salman Kaldred said [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=194.56s)]
*  you won the Pulitzer and we all celebrated with him and then he was canceled the next [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=200.44s)]
*  day in Frankfurt. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  So he's had a rough patch with this book, but it is worth reading because you learn [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=206.32s)]
*  a lot about how Palestinians live, what the restrictions are on their lives. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=210.42s)]
*  And he does it through a very imperfect character, Abd Salama, real guy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=217.76s)]
*  But we find out a lot about occupation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=223.0s)]
*  So Deb, first of all, on Night Watch, that's really intriguing to me. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=226.02s)]
*  And I find that particular period of time, like that decade, sort of the decade right [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=229.4s)]
*  after the Civil War, especially interesting and almost forgotten in the U.S. because it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=234.06s)]
*  was so tumultuous. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=238.46s)]
*  I became freshly aware of it reading the recent biography of Ulysses S. Grant by Chernow, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  where he goes into what was facing the U.S. and Grant's particular role in trying to pacify [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=245.34s)]
*  the situation and how truly awful things were in certain parts of the country, especially [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  defeated south of the United States. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to taking a look at that book. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=256.7s)]
*  And then the Nathan Thrall book also for completely different reasons. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  Sounds really interesting. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=261.94s)]
*  Is he, you mentioned he was canceled in Frankfurt. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=262.94s)]
*  Is that because the subject matter was seen as too troublesome for the German hosts or [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=265.5s)]
*  what was the reason there? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=270.09999999999997s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=271.26s)]
*  And late October, he was canceled in London for security reasons. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=272.26s)]
*  This one was somebody on the board of the place where he was speaking didn't like it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=275.34s)]
*  It's very difficult here in Germany to talk about Israel-Palestine without coming into [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=280.66s)]
*  conflict with the government. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=287.3s)]
*  The way that they crack down here on any kind of protest that is pro-Palestinian is much [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=289.5s)]
*  tougher than what's happening in the state. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=294.94000000000005s)]
*  So it wasn't surprising that he was canceled despite winning a Pulitzer Prize. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=296.8s)]
*  They found another venue for him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=302.42s)]
*  And I think that Germans are beginning to question this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=304.48s)]
*  Why can't we talk about this? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=307.26000000000005s)]
*  Nathan is the perfect person to do it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=309.86s)]
*  He spent 13 years living in Jerusalem working for the International Crisis Group. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  And he's encyclopedic in his facts. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=317.46s)]
*  I've covered the Middle East for a long time. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  Stuff I didn't know. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=322.18s)]
*  The color of your visa, who can go into East Jerusalem? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=323.94s)]
*  Who can't? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=328.18s)]
*  How the color of your visa changes if you've been in jail. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=329.5s)]
*  This is a bus that bursts into flames. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=333.26s)]
*  There are Israeli checkpoints nearby. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=335.98s)]
*  No one comes for these kids. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=338.42s)]
*  And so you begin to get this sense. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=340.62s)]
*  And the way he builds the book, he goes away from the accident and you learn a lot about [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=343.1s)]
*  Abu Salama. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=347.86s)]
*  And there's a moment where you think, why do I need to know all this? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=348.86s)]
*  But you need to care about somebody. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=350.94s)]
*  You need to know about somebody to really understand the tragedy of what happens on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=352.5s)]
*  that bus. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=357.66s)]
*  So I think it's timely. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  And obviously, so did the Pulitzer board. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  And who is Abu Salama? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=363.22s)]
*  A guy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  Honestly, he's a guy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  He doesn't marry the love of his life out of pride. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=367.62s)]
*  He ends up in a loveless marriage and takes on a second wife. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=370.78000000000003s)]
*  He finally has a boy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  And so the second part of this is to learn about Palestinian culture and society through [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=378.62s)]
*  a very, very conflicted character. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=385.86s)]
*  You know, he's not an official. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=389.1s)]
*  He's not a politician. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=390.1s)]
*  He's just a guy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  And that is why I think it's so deeply reported because, you know, just to look into the life [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=393.74s)]
*  of a civilian is a difficult endeavor. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=402.22s)]
*  And Thrall has done a great job on it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=405.38s)]
*  At a period of time in which people probably don't want to talk about normalcy. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=407.1s)]
*  No. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=411.46000000000004s)]
*  And that has been his problem in getting this book out. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  And so the Pulitzer Prize, I think, will give it more heft than it would have had. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  And I'm sure that for an author who's had his book tour canceled, it was a remarkable [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=419.74s)]
*  bit of karma. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=425.94s)]
*  So as the guest, I now get to ask you, Bob, let's start with you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=427.82s)]
*  And what have you been reading? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=432.14s)]
*  So I have been reading The World of Yesterday, which is a memoir by Stefan Zweig. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=434.52s)]
*  And I'm embarrassed to say I knew very little about Stefan Zweig, other than seeing him [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=440.66s)]
*  name checked in all sorts of reviews over the years. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=444.42s)]
*  He's certainly well known more recently as the inspiration for Wes Anderson's film The [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=448.5s)]
*  Grand Budapest Hotel. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=452.66s)]
*  I love memoirs and I love memoirs about this period of European history. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=454.5s)]
*  So it seemed like just a natural for me. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=459.82s)]
*  But Zweig is an unbelievably prolific author. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=462.02s)]
*  He was one of the world's most famous, if not the most famous author at one point in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=464.54s)]
*  the early in the 20th century. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=468.34s)]
*  And so I have a whole host of things to read now ahead of me, certainly inspired by reading [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=470.3s)]
*  this book. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=475.04s)]
*  He's someone who's born in 1881. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=476.04s)]
*  He's sort of growing up in this magical time in Vienna. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=479.16s)]
*  His father's a very prosperous merchant, Jewish family in Vienna. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=481.8s)]
*  And Zweig encounters, because of the society he grew up in, his own talents, the travels [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=487.0s)]
*  he undertook in Europe, he becomes well known to a whole host of famous people. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=492.44s)]
*  Sigmund Freud, Rainer Marie Rilke, the poet, Richard Strauss, the composer, Maxime Gorky, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  the sculptor Rodin, and so on and so on. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=504.85999999999996s)]
*  And he just lives this incredible life. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=508.14s)]
*  And through this memoir, he's evoking this period, this really lost period of European [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=510.34s)]
*  history, but an important period. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=515.6999999999999s)]
*  And there is a sense of foreboding. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=517.86s)]
*  There's partly a sense of foreboding because anybody who reads this book, it's pointed [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=519.9399999999999s)]
*  out early on in the foreword that Zweig, after submitting this to his publisher, committed [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=523.56s)]
*  suicide. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=528.3s)]
*  So this is his last act. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=529.3s)]
*  It's early in World War II or sort of mid-World War II. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=530.9s)]
*  He's in exile in Brazil. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  And this is his sort of his last creation. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=536.64s)]
*  And it's not a pity party by any means. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  He's really, again, as I said, evoking this incredible period of time. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=541.8s)]
*  But it's also, there are periods, his life is interrupted first by the traumas of World [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=545.4799999999999s)]
*  War I. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=549.64s)]
*  Then there's the weird sort of peaceful period, partly the Weimar Germany period and others [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=550.64s)]
*  in between the wars. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=555.28s)]
*  And then Nazism emerges. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=557.0s)]
*  His own beloved Austria, he cannot live in again. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=559.48s)]
*  And then he's living in a life of exile. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=562.9399999999999s)]
*  And so it's just his evocation of it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=565.06s)]
*  And it's really a public memoir. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=567.06s)]
*  You don't really find out much about his own personal life. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=569.18s)]
*  It's really about him living in these incredible situations and his impressions of it, which [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=571.66s)]
*  are really worth reading. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  And I'll just leave you with the final line from his book, which is kind of haunting. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=577.8199999999999s)]
*  He writes, in the last resort, every shadow is also the child of light. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=582.26s)]
*  And only those who have known the light and the dark have seen war and peace rise and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  fall have truly lived their lives. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=591.0799999999999s)]
*  Did you pick this because there's a mood of foreboding these days in the United States? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, I didn't initially. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=602.28s)]
*  It certainly became something that resonated with me, though, as I'm reading what he's [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=604.3599999999999s)]
*  saying and where he's traveling and what he's experiencing and so forth. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  There are definitely things that you could compare to either this present moment. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=613.56s)]
*  You could certainly compare it to that post falling of the Berlin Wall, euphoria period [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=618.46s)]
*  called by some the end of history and so forth. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=622.74s)]
*  So there are parallels there, certainly. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=625.3800000000001s)]
*  And that's why I say there's this element of foreboding. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=628.1s)]
*  That's not just what he's talking about, but also as you're reading this, you're thinking, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=630.9000000000001s)]
*  oh, OK, some of this sounds familiar. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=634.46s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=637.3000000000001s)]
*  And in many different genres, everybody has their favorite swag book. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=638.34s)]
*  And I actually listened to a podcast with this translator, Anthony Bell, who just said [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=641.82s)]
*  there are so many layers in the way he writes in German that it's a fascinating insight [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=646.2s)]
*  both into him, but also into the craft of writing into the German language. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=650.52s)]
*  That becomes part of the mission is to make sure to evoke that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=654.16s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm just scratching the surface here, jumping into the memoir, which was his [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=657.24s)]
*  last act. Carla, I wanted to turn to you and see what you would like to share from [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=661.4s)]
*  your bookshelf. So the book I just finished reading is called How to Win an Information [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=666.28s)]
*  War, and it's by the Ukrainian born British journalist Peter Pomerantsev. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=671.64s)]
*  And I followed his work since 2014 when he started publishing widely about Russian [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=676.8199999999999s)]
*  information warfare, the doctrine, the strategy and the tactics. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, Washington wasn't really paying any attention, but Ukraine and the Baltics [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=686.22s)]
*  were already targets of major disinformation campaigns by the Kremlin's political [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=690.26s)]
*  technologists. It's really a term that I really just love because it really sort of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=695.06s)]
*  goes to the core of what he's writing about. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=699.42s)]
*  And this book tells the tale of Sefton Delmer. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=702.0s)]
*  And he's a British reporter for the Daily Express, who covered with incredible access [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=704.8399999999999s)]
*  the rise of Adolf Hitler. And really, he was on the plane covering Hitler's campaigns. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=709.68s)]
*  It's really sort of hard for us as reporters to imagine that there were political [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=714.0799999999999s)]
*  campaigns for Hitler, but there were. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=717.64s)]
*  And he really was right in there with Goebbels all the time. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=719.8s)]
*  And after covering all of this, once the British intelligence got over their mistrust [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=723.3s)]
*  of him, he went and worked for them and he directed a series of propaganda operations [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=729.58s)]
*  during the war, including creating several fake Nazi radio services, all of which were [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=734.26s)]
*  broadcast from a great country house outside of London. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=739.18s)]
*  And one of the most popular featured this character, Der Chef, who was this hugely [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=742.62s)]
*  profane and anti-Semitic, unnamed military leader who was played by a German Jewish [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=747.36s)]
*  emigre, a guy who was a writer of detective novels and a literary agent in London. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=752.1s)]
*  And this Der Chef defended the honor of the German military while denouncing the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=757.0400000000001s)]
*  thievery, the corruption, the perversion, talking about SS orgies at a monastery in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=761.84s)]
*  Bavaria, committed by the Nazi elite and their families. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=766.16s)]
*  And the details that Der Chef used were based on a mixture of actual British [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=769.72s)]
*  intelligence. Ian Fleming, who was working then for British Naval Intelligence, was a [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=773.52s)]
*  source, as well as very clever disinformation. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=778.0s)]
*  And the production was apparently so persuasive in undermining trust in the Nazis that [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=781.42s)]
*  the U.S. embassy in Berlin, and the U.S. was not yet in the war, reported that the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=786.74s)]
*  broadcasts were likely coming from disaffected German army officers. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=791.02s)]
*  So, I mean, this is really quite compelling stuff. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=795.38s)]
*  And Pomerantz weaves these stories of Delmer's counter-propaganda efforts with his [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=799.18s)]
*  own recent reporting experiences in Ukraine and before that in Russia. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=804.9399999999999s)]
*  And here the book gets a lot weaker because he's trying to build a case for how we [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=808.9599999999999s)]
*  might push back right now against modern day Russian information warfare. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=812.68s)]
*  He argues, it's not a particularly compelling insight, I mean, pretty obvious that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=817.64s)]
*  appealing to people's higher order values is far less effective than appealing to [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=822.0s)]
*  their immediate self-interest. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=826.4399999999999s)]
*  As I said, not a transcending insight, and I'm not sure what it says for journalists [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=828.76s)]
*  in particular who are constantly having to push back against disinformation. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=832.24s)]
*  But the story itself about the radios is a great yarn and his descriptions of how [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=836.5400000000001s)]
*  propaganda seizes popular imaginations, preying as much on people's need to belong [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=841.12s)]
*  as on darker impulses, I really think it's useful for understanding Russia today. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=846.0600000000001s)]
*  And I fear for understanding what's going on here. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=850.0600000000001s)]
*  Timely as well. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=852.98s)]
*  I mean, there's stories in the newspapers, I'm sure where you are too, about a [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=854.2800000000001s)]
*  disinformation campaign in France that Russia appears to be running to say the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=859.76s)]
*  Olympics going to be terrible. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=866.6s)]
*  Their team is not allowed to compete except as independents. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=868.28s)]
*  And this is kind of a revenge misinformation campaign to keep people away from the [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=873.0s)]
*  Olympics. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=879.24s)]
*  You know, this is one we know about. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=880.2s)]
*  And we have to, I mean, this is sort of stealing ourselves for what's going to [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=882.52s)]
*  happen in the American election. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=886.04s)]
*  One of the things about Pomerantsev that I find so compelling is that he really [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=889.42s)]
*  got it so long before we got it in 2016. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=892.38s)]
*  And that's when, you know, I've been reading him before then. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=895.02s)]
*  I think what's dissatisfying about the book is he doesn't have an answer. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=898.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean, the book is called How to Win an Information War. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=901.74s)]
*  And I really did want an answer here. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=904.26s)]
*  You know, we who write fact checking, there's so many great fact checking [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=906.14s)]
*  outfits that are out there and that work in Ukraine, that work in all sorts of [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=910.3399999999999s)]
*  places in Europe and also in the United States. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=913.4s)]
*  We're caught in this thing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=916.36s)]
*  I mean, is the, you know, is the truth sandwich the way you do it? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=917.28s)]
*  You know, every time we write something, we say, of course, this is a lie, but [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=920.4399999999999s)]
*  nevertheless, this is what, you know, President Trump and other people have [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=922.96s)]
*  said. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=925.4s)]
*  You know, we wrestle with this as reporters. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=926.04s)]
*  And then there's this other question. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=928.4s)]
*  So many of the people in this book are journalists who then get involved [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=929.84s)]
*  themselves in counter propaganda exercises. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  I personally am not going to get involved in that, but we wrestle with this every [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=936.3199999999999s)]
*  day. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=939.56s)]
*  That said, there's a great series of yarns here. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=939.92s)]
*  And in reading about it, you do understand why propaganda itself is so effective. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=942.14s)]
*  You know, I wonder, I just finished teaching journalism to 20 year olds here [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=947.5400000000001s)]
*  in, in Berlin. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=951.3000000000001s)]
*  And there's a moment where you realize they live in a different world than we [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=953.1s)]
*  do. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=955.4200000000001s)]
*  And I wonder if- [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=956.0s)]
*  Because they're twin or because they're German? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=957.98s)]
*  Neither, because none of them are German. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=960.0600000000001s)]
*  They're all Ukrainians, Syrians, Hungarians, Romanians. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=961.62s)]
*  That's the kind of class that I had. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=966.0600000000001s)]
*  But what I mean is they are taking in disinformation, misinformation, fake news, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=967.34s)]
*  like a fire hose. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=974.3000000000001s)]
*  And I wonder if they're not better at it than we are because they live in the [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=976.1800000000001s)]
*  world of this. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=982.7800000000001s)]
*  And maybe the idea here is to just give people skills on how to recognize the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=984.46s)]
*  misinformation because you can't stop any of it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=992.1s)]
*  You cannot. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=995.1400000000001s)]
*  We are now in a world where everybody sees everything. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=995.68s)]
*  So how to filter it, but also how to find the genuine sources of information. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=997.9599999999999s)]
*  Because- [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1002.36s)]
*  I think, but I've just had this realization after being with all of them for 14 weeks [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1002.88s)]
*  that they live in a different world than we do. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1007.16s)]
*  And it's a generational divide. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1009.4s)]
*  And I don't have an influencer. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1011.6s)]
*  I don't care what my favorite movie person thinks about Ukraine. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1014.52s)]
*  I really don't, but they do. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1018.52s)]
*  And they read it and they have influencers that tell them stuff. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  So I think it's an inoculation campaign. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1024.14s)]
*  But does it inoculate them? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1027.1000000000001s)]
*  Are they vigilantly inoculated? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1028.94s)]
*  And if they're studying journalism, do they have an answer to this question that I [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1031.3400000000001s)]
*  don't think this book actually answers? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1035.94s)]
*  So here's their obsession, which I have noticed. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1038.5s)]
*  And I really noticed it here in Berlin is for open source investigations. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1041.7s)]
*  I'll prove the truth. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1046.5s)]
*  I will go and do facial recognition and geolocating and I will show you what [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1048.18s)]
*  happened in Mariupol and I will design an entire website where I'll show you [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1053.46s)]
*  what happened in Mariupol. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1057.56s)]
*  So on the one hand, they're being bombarded with mistruths, but on the other [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1058.56s)]
*  hand, they're obsessed with truth is justice, narrative is justice. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1062.76s)]
*  And it's a very interesting frame for this generation to take in the world. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1067.3600000000001s)]
*  That would be a nice coda for the Pomerantsev book to add something like that, to [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1074.8s)]
*  fill in what you were looking for, Carla, maybe. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1078.8s)]
*  So there is this one other project that Pomerantsev is involved in that intrigues me. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1080.54s)]
*  It's not mentioned so much in the book, but follows exactly on that. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1085.3s)]
*  And he's part of something called the Reckoning Project that teaches Ukrainian [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1088.66s)]
*  journalists to collect evidence. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1092.9s)]
*  And they teach them special interview techniques, as well as data collection [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1095.5s)]
*  that can be used not only for journalism, but for war crimes prosecutions. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1098.74s)]
*  Cause it is different how to preserve this information, how you interview people, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1102.46s)]
*  not playing on trauma so much. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1106.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think that's really the Lord's work. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1110.74s)]
*  I mean, this next generation of journalists, they are certainly, they have different [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1111.48s)]
*  tools than we had when we were coming up in the business. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1115.8s)]
*  And so maybe that is a hopeful thought Deb, that they can use those tools there. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1118.8s)]
*  So they've got the influencers as the sort of the negative on one [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1123.9s)]
*  shoulder and then the other one, that they have all this ability to collect [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1126.6000000000001s)]
*  data and they can see things. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1129.72s)]
*  We also know that so many images can be manipulated, but I'll go [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1131.52s)]
*  out on the hopeful note here. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1134.56s)]
*  Let us hope be hopeful. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1136.96s)]
*  So that now we have these books we can recommend to our listeners. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  Let's share what's been on our to read list. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1141.6000000000001s)]
*  Bob, why don't you start us off? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1144.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1146.96s)]
*  Well, I decided to choose one of my favorite authors on issues of climate [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1147.56s)]
*  change and not favorite because she makes me feel warm and fuzzy, but because she [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1152.72s)]
*  just kind of lays it out in really authoritative terms, that would be Elizabeth [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1157.0s)]
*  Colbert, longtime New Yorker writer, Pulitzer prize winner for the book, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1160.1200000000001s)]
*  The Sixth Extinction. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1163.8s)]
*  It is really troubling stuff that she covers. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1165.5s)]
*  However, she has a new collection of essays called H is for Hope in which [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1167.94s)]
*  he takes every alphabet letter. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1172.42s)]
*  So 26 letters and each of them stands for something. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1173.7600000000002s)]
*  They're not all hopeful things by the way, but they are all things that add up to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1176.6200000000001s)]
*  understanding this moment that we're in and what is involved in understanding [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1180.1000000000001s)]
*  climate change and trying to do something about it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1184.8600000000001s)]
*  And so just to give you a little flavor of what the letters stand for, the A is [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1187.5s)]
*  for a person named Svante Arrhenius, if I pronounced that right, who is, I believe [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1191.22s)]
*  a Swedish individual who created the world's first climate model back in 1894. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1195.72s)]
*  Pretty extraordinary. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1200.4s)]
*  The Z stands for ground zero. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1201.92s)]
*  And what she says is ground zero for climate change, the United States, the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1204.92s)]
*  Colorado river basin in between. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1207.46s)]
*  She has B stands for blah, blah, blah of the Greta Thunberg, blah, blah, blah [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1209.8s)]
*  speech about it's time to start doing something and stop blathering on the E is [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1213.88s)]
*  for an all electric plane that she learns to fly. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1218.44s)]
*  So there's some, some of the hopefulness that comes through in this is the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1221.5s)]
*  extraordinary progress made in things like zero emission technologies and in [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1224.92s)]
*  renewable energy and so forth. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1231.18s)]
*  And she deliberately tries to get the H for hope in there to give people a sense [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1233.5600000000002s)]
*  like, that's not throw our hands up for this problem that she has been chronicling [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1237.38s)]
*  probably better, almost better than anybody, but like, let's get out there and [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1242.0s)]
*  start trying to do something about it and get to zero emission and all those things [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1245.1000000000001s)]
*  that are still far off because it's happening. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1249.3000000000002s)]
*  And as she has said repeatedly, it's coming for all of us. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1251.96s)]
*  Well, this notion of not getting completely paralyzed seems so absolutely essential. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1255.3400000000001s)]
*  I, with my own students, I give them a choice of topics in my intro class for [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1260.18s)]
*  what they want to do for their presentations. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1264.9s)]
*  And I've been really surprised for the last two years that they haven't [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1267.42s)]
*  volunteered to do climate. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1271.14s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1272.74s)]
*  That's surprising. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1273.14s)]
*  I keep telling them, I mean, there are things they want to do responsibility to [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1274.0600000000002s)]
*  protect and they want to do cyber conflict and they want to do nuclear weapons. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1277.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, they haven't been rushing. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1281.8000000000002s)]
*  I have to like, wheedle them into doing, keep saying to them, this is the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1282.94s)]
*  existential threat of your lifetime. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1285.88s)]
*  And when I asked them why I get this answer, this sort of, what can we do about it? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1288.48s)]
*  Which I find incredibly depressing. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1294.4s)]
*  And it's not that, you know, 15 years ago, people were saying, well, you can't [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1296.6000000000001s)]
*  really say extreme weather is caused by this or you can't eat it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1300.3200000000002s)]
*  You can't smell it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1303.16s)]
*  You can't necessarily see it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1303.88s)]
*  And now this other extreme of, we're not sure we seem paralyzed by it. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1305.16s)]
*  Not everyone. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1309.4s)]
*  I have students who were majoring in sustainability, but a remarkable number [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1310.2s)]
*  of them who, who are not volunteering to focus on it because they feel paralyzed. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1313.8799999999999s)]
*  It's nice to know that age is for hope. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1318.06s)]
*  You know, I think this is a bigger issue among young people in Europe. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1320.44s)]
*  I see it here. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1324.32s)]
*  People care about it. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1325.56s)]
*  People talk about it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1326.44s)]
*  People study it. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1327.6s)]
*  You know, there's these demonstrations that go on all the time in Europe, certainly [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1328.6399999999999s)]
*  in Germany, there are, I don't know why that is, but as soon as I got here, I [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1334.76s)]
*  noticed it, it is just a different level. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1339.48s)]
*  I don't think that there was the campaign in Europe of climate deniers as there was [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1342.7s)]
*  in the U S I think it's a, an American phenomenon that young people aren't as [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1348.34s)]
*  engaged as they are here. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1354.06s)]
*  Also politicians don't question it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1356.38s)]
*  But Deb, we're also reading a bit about in the run up to the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1359.26s)]
*  Euro parliament elections, that there's been a bit of a backlash against some [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1361.54s)]
*  of the green policies in terms of it's hit people in their pocketbooks in [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1364.6200000000001s)]
*  different ways it's hit some of the industries like in Germany, it certainly [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1369.1s)]
*  hit some of the auto related industries. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1372.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's interesting to say how they're trying to reconcile that. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1375.52s)]
*  Cause the green parties look to take a bit of a beating in the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1378.1599999999999s)]
*  Euro parliament elections. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1380.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1381.7199999999998s)]
*  And a lot of that is more about immigration than it is about climate change. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1382.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't think it's our students don't care about it. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1387.1999999999998s)]
*  It's this insensitive agency. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1390.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think that does have to do with the politics in the United States. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1392.6399999999999s)]
*  And it is because of the climate resistance and all the obstructionism of it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1396.22s)]
*  I also, there's this absolutely wonderful Vox video that showed how the Republicans [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1401.1s)]
*  turned against climate change. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1406.22s)]
*  There was a period of time. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1407.26s)]
*  There was this absolutely fabulous ad of Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi together [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1408.62s)]
*  saying, we don't agree about a lot, but climate is one of the things we do agree [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1413.82s)]
*  about there was a period of time in which Mitt Romney, John McCain, lots of [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1417.56s)]
*  Republicans and Newt Gingrich agreed on climate change. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1422.32s)]
*  That was something we had to act on. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1425.54s)]
*  And then, you know, Coke money came in and it was off to the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1427.44s)]
*  races about climate denial. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1431.36s)]
*  So I think it's that sense. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1433.0s)]
*  And certainly for these younger people, they've grown up in a world in which [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1434.6s)]
*  obstructionism and Washington on climate really gives them this sense of, we're [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1438.1599999999999s)]
*  not sure what we can do. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1442.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying all my students, as I said, I have students who major in this, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1443.02s)]
*  but I think the difference with Europe is transcendent. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1445.78s)]
*  And also, you know, you had a ruling and it was a couple of years ago in the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1448.12s)]
*  German Supreme Court that took into account the climate for future generations. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1452.7s)]
*  And that's happening here. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1460.22s)]
*  You've got young people here suing in different states about their future, but [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1461.18s)]
*  you're right. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1464.96s)]
*  We haven't had that ruling. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1465.46s)]
*  And unlikely too with this Supreme Court. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1466.78s)]
*  So Deb, moving right along, I'd like to hear what you are gearing up to read. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1469.26s)]
*  So for me, I think it's going to be the Steve Cole book. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1473.46s)]
*  He is such a remarkable researcher. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1477.32s)]
*  And, you know, there is no detail that he doesn't put his hand on and put into a [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1482.1200000000001s)]
*  book and it's called the Achilles Trap, Saddam Hussein, the CIA and the origins [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1486.92s)]
*  of America's invasion of Iraq. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1491.44s)]
*  I covered both the first one and the second one. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1493.0s)]
*  And so I think I will now find out everything I didn't know when I was on the [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1496.84s)]
*  ground, as soon as I finished watching silly programs on Netflix, I read a [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1502.96s)]
*  tackle that one. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1507.16s)]
*  I'm giggling because that's my next book too. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1508.02s)]
*  And I am intrigued by it. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1511.46s)]
*  For the same reason, no doubt. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1514.5s)]
*  Yes, for the same reason. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1515.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm eager to read it because it purports to answer the question that has nodded me [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1516.9s)]
*  ever since I covered the run-up to the war from the 2003 war from DC. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1520.94s)]
*  You know, at this point, we know painfully why the Bush administration and all of [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1526.3000000000002s)]
*  Washington miscalculated so badly and persuaded itself that Saddam still had [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1529.5s)]
*  stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1533.98s)]
*  You know, confirmation bias group thing. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1536.5s)]
*  But what this book purports to answer is this question of why didn't Saddam show [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1539.28s)]
*  the world that he no longer had any WMD? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1543.46s)]
*  He had 12 years of these punishing international sanctions and with the U.S. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1546.46s)]
*  poised to invade, you know, why did he risk his regime, you know, and ultimately [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1550.56s)]
*  his life to maintain that lie? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1554.46s)]
*  And one of the things about the book that seems so intriguing is he has access to [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1557.8s)]
*  these transcripts and these tapes that they captured. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1562.52s)]
*  And Saddam, like Richard Nixon, he had a tape recorder in his office and he was [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1565.8s)]
*  taping his meetings with bath leaders and with foreign dignitaries and the U.S. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1571.36s)]
*  military went in and they got these tapes and these transcripts and they were [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1576.92s)]
*  available for a while at the National Defense University and then the center [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1580.12s)]
*  that was there that had these things ran out of funding and they suddenly were not [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1584.2s)]
*  available and then calls sued, you know, went for a FOIA request and got access [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1589.48s)]
*  to them. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1595.88s)]
*  So, you know, he's asking this question, which has completely intrigued me. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1596.3600000000001s)]
*  And I must admit also Deb that I wanted to raise this because I knew you were [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1600.84s)]
*  going to be on and Deb and I in the first war were in the room next to each other [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1604.2s)]
*  at the Dharan International Hotel. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1610.2s)]
*  There we were. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1611.8s)]
*  And I knew absolutely nothing about the Middle East and Deb taught me everything [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1612.16s)]
*  I know about the Middle East. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1615.28s)]
*  So I had to bring that up. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1616.08s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to the memoir that's co-authored by the two of you on that [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1616.8s)]
*  experience. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1619.84s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1620.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1620.64s)]
*  Combat tailoring as we like to refer to it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1621.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1624.36s)]
*  I know we were there for a long time. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1624.92s)]
*  You know, the other thing is that Saddam was such a chatty Cathy when he was [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1626.8799999999999s)]
*  waiting for his trial. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1631.36s)]
*  I met a researcher who now runs an organization called Sija. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1633.08s)]
*  He's a war crimes investigator. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1638.24s)]
*  He was working for the UN and he told me that Saddam had a bunch of Iraqi lawyers [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1639.8s)]
*  and they were all so scared of him. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1644.8799999999999s)]
*  They didn't ask him any questions. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1645.96s)]
*  And the Americans said, oh, this isn't going really badly. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1647.16s)]
*  So Bill Wiley, could you please go and talk to Saddam and be his lawyer for a [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1649.2s)]
*  while? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1654.24s)]
*  And he did. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1654.56s)]
*  And for four months every day for hours, he talked to Saddam and all of that's on [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1656.04s)]
*  the record. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1661.44s)]
*  So, you know, he wanted a record out there. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1661.88s)]
*  I'm not surprised that he recorded stuff now that I hear you talk about it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1665.28s)]
*  And some of the answers, I mean, you know, he later tell US investigators about [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1668.68s)]
*  Kuwait, quote, if you didn't want me to go in, why didn't you tell me? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1673.2s)]
*  I mean, these are sort of really intriguing things. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1677.32s)]
*  And he was so persuaded that the CIA knew everything. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1680.44s)]
*  It was so powerful. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1684.96s)]
*  And this is what Call writes, a CIA capable of getting such a big question dead [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1686.76s)]
*  wrong on the facts was not consistent with Saddam's bedrock assumptions. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1690.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, these are sort of interesting insights that how these two countries could [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1694.76s)]
*  so deal with each other so much. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1699.76s)]
*  Certainly we backed him in the Iran-Iraq war. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1702.04s)]
*  How could we so misread each other? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1704.76s)]
*  And I think that's a big part of this book. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1707.4s)]
*  So I'm really looking forward to it because I've been gnawing over this. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1709.28s)]
*  And I think so many people in Washington are like, we always knew we didn't have [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1712.04s)]
*  WMD. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1715.76s)]
*  Which is baloney for those of us who covered this. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1717.0s)]
*  We didn't know it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1719.28s)]
*  The question is, if he knew he didn't have WMD, why didn't he tell us? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1720.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's why I want to read the book. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1724.52s)]
*  If you spend any time in the Middle East, everybody in the Middle East believes the [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1726.2s)]
*  CIA knows everything. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1730.08s)]
*  That is just a given. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1732.16s)]
*  Saddam was no outlier on that one. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1733.2s)]
*  And one of the sentences that I said so often in the Middle East is, they're not [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1736.04s)]
*  that good. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1740.4s)]
*  And there was no way to convince anybody that the CIA doesn't know everything. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1741.6000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, having covered the run up to the 2003 invasion at the UN, like day [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1748.04s)]
*  after day and trooping into the Security Council, the UN gets a bad rap for a lot [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1752.72s)]
*  of things and some of it is certainly deserved. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1758.52s)]
*  But the UN actually had it right. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1760.16s)]
*  First of all, their mission that went in and demilitarized or DWMD as the case may [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1761.8400000000001s)]
*  be Iraq was successful. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1766.8s)]
*  It actually worked. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1768.5600000000002s)]
*  It was an international system with heavy scrutiny and monitors that took away this [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1769.64s)]
*  power on biological, chemical and nuclear weapons from the Iraqis. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1774.52s)]
*  And it was shunted aside for other reasons. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1779.24s)]
*  So I'm not sure I would agree with that assessment, Bob, of keeping in mind that [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1782.08s)]
*  they got pulled out in 1998. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1785.84s)]
*  I would argue that this has as much to do with sanctions and not having access to the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1787.8799999999999s)]
*  things to keep it up. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1793.08s)]
*  And we can arm wrestle about that. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1794.08s)]
*  I would say we can take that on a separate discussion. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1795.76s)]
*  I think the other reason I want to read the book is, is did Saddam really know he [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1798.1999999999998s)]
*  didn't have the stuff? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1801.6s)]
*  I mean, that's the other question that I've always wondered about. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1803.36s)]
*  I mean, I think in that system, did people have the guts to tell him that there were [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  nothing left in the larder, that there were no biological weapons left? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1811.16s)]
*  You know, and as Hans Flix once said, you know, mustard gas is not marmalade. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, you don't pour it down the drain. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1819.76s)]
*  I mean, did Saddam know? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1821.68s)]
*  I mean, if you were like the guy who was in charge of maintaining the stocks of [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1823.2800000000002s)]
*  mustard gas and you realize that most of the stuff had evaporated, would you have [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1827.1200000000001s)]
*  had the guts to send the word up back up to Baghdad that you no longer had anything [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1831.1200000000001s)]
*  left? I don't think I would have had the guts knowing the way Saddam took bad news. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1834.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1839.3999999999999s)]
*  Not good for your future. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1839.92s)]
*  Or your family. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1841.24s)]
*  Well, these are great suggestions. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1842.8s)]
*  The cold book sounds like a true winner. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1844.24s)]
*  How about we take a break from books and Carla maybe expand it to movies or [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1846.24s)]
*  podcasts or even a musical? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1851.48s)]
*  I'll sing this one. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1855.36s)]
*  So my husband and I just watched Vodkan on Netflix. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1856.76s)]
*  It's a seven part, well, is it a murder mystery? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1860.56s)]
*  Is it a dark comedy? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1863.76s)]
*  Let's just say it's really odd, but it captured our attention. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1864.92s)]
*  At its most basic, it's the story of three reporters for The Guardian who are making [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1868.8s)]
*  a true crime drum roll podcast about the disappearance of three people 20 years ago [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1873.1200000000001s)]
*  from a tiny Irish town, a fictional town of Vodkan during their annual, I think I'm [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1878.88s)]
*  pronouncing this right, Samhain festival, which is a Gaelic version of Halloween. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1883.48s)]
*  You know, unfortunately I found the character of the podcasters played by Will Forte, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1888.1200000000001s)]
*  as I probably pronounce it, an SNL regular, pretty much of an unappealing dork. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1891.76s)]
*  Sorry, panel casters. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1896.52s)]
*  But his relentlessly bitter partner in this project, Dove, is an Irish investigative [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1898.36s)]
*  reporter for The Guardian who has been sent there under extreme protests by her editors [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1903.0s)]
*  to help her after her source on a national health service expose commits suicide. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1907.1999999999998s)]
*  She is definitely really interesting though. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1911.9199999999998s)]
*  One wonders how she ever gets anyone to talk to her because she's really mean. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1914.1999999999998s)]
*  And their researcher, Emi, is a dream. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1918.48s)]
*  She's efficient, she's enthusiastic and undoubtedly the most talented of the three [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1920.7199999999998s)]
*  of Seriously Wet Behind the Ears. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1924.3999999999999s)]
*  But the mystery really kept us watching, not least because it includes an illicit [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1926.4s)]
*  trade in eels and that really is a serious problem. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1929.76s)]
*  So in your book, Bob, is E for eels as it turns out. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1932.24s)]
*  And there are defrock nuns selling yogurt, retreats and lots of other fun stuff. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1936.24s)]
*  And drugs. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1940.24s)]
*  Vodkan also led me to make a list of movies featuring the business of journalism that [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1941.28s)]
*  haven't got a lot of attention in recent years that I plan to revisit this summer. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1945.68s)]
*  And I figured that most of you could add some of your suggestions. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1948.92s)]
*  So on my list, Good Night and Good Luck about journalism icon Edward R. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1952.08s)]
*  Murrow and his battle with U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, which seems particularly [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1956.4s)]
*  apt for our times. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1960.64s)]
*  The China Syndrome from 1979, which is the story of a television reporter played by [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1962.56s)]
*  Jane Fonda and her cameraman, Michael Douglas, who discovers safety coverups at a nuclear [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1967.28s)]
*  power plant. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1971.76s)]
*  The term China Syndrome itself has entered the lexicon. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1972.96s)]
*  It's this fictional idea that somehow a nuclear meltdown is going to penetrate through [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1975.84s)]
*  the core of the earth to China. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1979.12s)]
*  Network from 1976, directed by Sidney Lamette, written by Patty Chayefsky. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1981.2800000000002s)]
*  And it's about a TV network struggle with poor ratings, another thing for our time. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1986.24s)]
*  And Peter Finch plays, you know, Howard Beale, this anchor who threatens to commit suicide [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1990.88s)]
*  on air. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1995.92s)]
*  An idea that his bosses, including his producer played by Faye Donahue, love so much because [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=1996.96s)]
*  it drives up the ratings and they play it for all it's worth. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2001.52s)]
*  I am a total sucker for Aaron Sorkin, so I'll probably rewatch The Newsroom, which is his [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2005.1200000000001s)]
*  gauzy West Wing like take on television news, which is starring Jeff Daniels and Emily [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2010.0s)]
*  Mortimer. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2014.96s)]
*  If you haven't seen it, I absolutely love it. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2015.44s)]
*  It was never a very popular Aaron Sorkin one, but I really love it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2017.12s)]
*  Me too. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2020.16s)]
*  Did you love it? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2020.72s)]
*  I just- [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2021.36s)]
*  I did. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2021.84s)]
*  It just makes me really happy. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2022.4s)]
*  And for those who yearn to be foreign correspondents, there's the Year of Living Dangerously, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2024.32s)]
*  although the journalistic ethics in that one is seriously off. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2029.12s)]
*  And Mel Gibson plays a neophyte Australian reporter in Indonesia in the weeks before [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2031.76s)]
*  the overthrow of Soekarno. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2035.84s)]
*  It's really a love story with Sigourney Weaver. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2037.12s)]
*  And Linda Hunt won an Oscar for that and she plays his photographer Billy Kwan, who [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2040.1599999999999s)]
*  gets him sources and tries to evoke his sense of morality as a reporter. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2045.52s)]
*  And finally, The Killing Fields, which is a more accurate take on being a foreign [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2049.7599999999998s)]
*  correspondent about Sidney Shanberg and his Cambodian photographer, Dith Pran, who gets [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2054.48s)]
*  left behind to the not tender mercies of the Khmer Rouge. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2058.48s)]
*  And really finally, His Girl Friday, which is a 1940 American screwball comedy, as they [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2063.4399999999996s)]
*  call them, which is directed by Howard Hawks. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2068.64s)]
*  It's got Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2071.04s)]
*  And he is the most hardboiled of hardboiled newspaper editors. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2073.4399999999996s)]
*  And she's his ex-wife and ace reporter. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2076.9599999999996s)]
*  And he tries to win her back by getting her to cover the execution of a murderer and chaos [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2079.12s)]
*  and hijinks and execution ensue. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  So those are the movies I'm planning on watching this summer about journalism. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2089.4399999999996s)]
*  And I recommend them all. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2092.7999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2094.24s)]
*  You got any for my list, Deb, Bob? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2094.72s)]
*  Civil War is here in Berlin. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2097.3599999999997s)]
*  And my German friends always want to come and talk to me after they see it because there's [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2100.3199999999997s)]
*  some things they don't understand about this journal. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2105.2s)]
*  The curse that does one right. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2107.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2109.2s)]
*  About the journalists. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2109.8399999999997s)]
*  Are they all that cynical? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2110.8799999999997s)]
*  I was asked. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2112.72s)]
*  I said, well, there's, you know, different levels of cynicism among the three of them. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2113.4399999999996s)]
*  And if you're a journalist, you can see that there's a wide difference between the three [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2119.52s)]
*  of them. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2123.6s)]
*  But it's really most of that movie is about the business of journalism. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2124.72s)]
*  Although these people do not ever seem to file. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2129.68s)]
*  That is a question that I had when I was watching it. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2132.32s)]
*  That's a question I have about a lot of movies. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2135.52s)]
*  Like you've watched Salvador. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2137.36s)]
*  I mean, like they never file. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2138.4s)]
*  They don't file. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2140.24s)]
*  They don't take notes. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2141.7599999999998s)]
*  They don't file. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2142.64s)]
*  So ladies and gentlemen who are not journalists, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2146.32s)]
*  we file. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2148.96s)]
*  We take notes. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2150.56s)]
*  We file. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2151.28s)]
*  Keep that in mind. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2153.28s)]
*  Bob, do you have a favorite journalism movie or TV show? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2154.64s)]
*  I was going to add the killing fields if you didn't add that at the end, but those are all [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2158.2400000000002s)]
*  that's a great representation. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2161.2s)]
*  Obviously all the president's men is a great one, too, for just the craft of things. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2162.4s)]
*  And watching Hoffman and Redford piece things together in the early 70s. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2166.8s)]
*  It's just a great, great evocation of Washington, too, in that time. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2171.92s)]
*  I would add also just the much loved HBO series, The Wire. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2175.2s)]
*  And it's last year or two. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2179.3599999999997s)]
*  It has some interesting Baltimore Sun type depiction of what's going on there and how [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2181.2s)]
*  they're trying to cover the drug war and just sort of what's happening to the city of Baltimore. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2185.04s)]
*  And some of the sort of things that questionable doings of some of the people in the newsroom [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2188.9599999999996s)]
*  there and that's all ethics of journalism. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2193.52s)]
*  I think it's an interesting component to the overall story that they're trying to tell. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2195.52s)]
*  Obviously The Wire written by a Baltimore Sun alum. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2199.2s)]
*  So it does capture that as well. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2201.7599999999998s)]
*  And so I would recommend that, too. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2203.2s)]
*  Oh, well, you know, that one was always interesting for me because the editor that this script is [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2204.8799999999997s)]
*  based on came to NPR that a moment when I was there and I would hear him saying those lines. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2211.2s)]
*  It's like, wait, I've heard those before. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2216.08s)]
*  They were on television. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  You're talking about Bill Marrowell. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2219.4399999999996s)]
*  I am. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2221.2799999999997s)]
*  He was a Neiman with my husband. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2221.9199999999996s)]
*  So although I will say that David Simon, who did The Wire, he truly hated the Sun. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2223.6s)]
*  I mean, I think that of all of the different years of The Wire, that one is the meanest one. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2228.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's me. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2234.0s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2234.64s)]
*  His depiction of the Sun is really rude. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2235.6s)]
*  I agree. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2237.44s)]
*  I agree. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2237.92s)]
*  And the Sun was a great paper. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2238.48s)]
*  It really was. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2240.0s)]
*  So like many other local papers, it's still battling on. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2240.8s)]
*  But it used to have foreign correspondents. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2244.4s)]
*  Wouldn't you remember in the Middle East, Robert Ruby? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2246.48s)]
*  I mean, just absolutely. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2248.32s)]
*  I knew Robert Ruby in the Middle East. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2249.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2250.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2251.68s)]
*  I used to yearn to cover, you know, to work for the Baltimore Sun and be a foreign correspondent [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2252.08s)]
*  for them. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2256.24s)]
*  I mean, you think these all these great local papers. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2256.64s)]
*  And, you know, Russell Baker got his start there and covered the Queen Elizabeth's [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2258.96s)]
*  coronation and everything. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2263.44s)]
*  It's a great part of his book growing up. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2264.4s)]
*  So anyway, I digress. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2266.16s)]
*  So Deb, besides books, what's something else that you are going to be indulging yourself [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2267.68s)]
*  with this summer? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2273.28s)]
*  I've already done The Hitman, which I love. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2274.32s)]
*  There's not many movies that just hit every note persically. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2277.68s)]
*  The Fall Guy was too long. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2283.44s)]
*  This one is just right. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2284.7200000000003s)]
*  And The Hitman is based on a real character. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2286.64s)]
*  They make up some of the sacks of his hittery. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2291.2s)]
*  But nevertheless, it allows humor without making the characters cartoonish. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2294.96s)]
*  And you root for the bad guys and the real bad guys get their comeuppance. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2304.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's the best 90 minutes, whatever it was, that I have spent in a long time. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2308.96s)]
*  Movies can be a teeny disappointing. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2315.7599999999998s)]
*  The other thing that I wanted to tell you about is a podcast that the BBC has out called [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2317.8399999999997s)]
*  Things Fell Apart. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2323.52s)]
*  And I'm John Ronson. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2325.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's all about the battles of the culture wars, mostly in the US. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2327.3599999999997s)]
*  Abortion rights, book banning, COVID, police shootings. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2333.2799999999997s)]
*  And he has, as the British say, a fetching way of construction. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2337.8399999999997s)]
*  So even if you think you know the story and you'll hear some things that are familiar [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2343.76s)]
*  to you, he will reveal things that you never even thought about. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2349.84s)]
*  And we'll start one place and then, oh, this is about Rodney King. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2353.92s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2358.1600000000003s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2359.36s)]
*  And it's his second season. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2360.48s)]
*  The reviews are fantastic and it is worth your while. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2362.96s)]
*  And he's just marvelous. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2366.96s)]
*  His voice is pleasing to hear. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2368.6400000000003s)]
*  He has just a way of delivering his stories. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2370.48s)]
*  I'm already looking up where the hitman is playing. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2375.6s)]
*  Well, may you have persuaded me. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2377.84s)]
*  Go tonight. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2380.4s)]
*  I want to go tonight. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2381.2s)]
*  You want me to chime in with my book? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2384.32s)]
*  Please, Bob. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2387.28s)]
*  So I'm also in the podcast realm. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2388.64s)]
*  Discovered earlier this year, a podcast called, which is apparently quite popular in the UK, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2391.04s)]
*  called The Rest is Politics. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2396.72s)]
*  And it's got two extremely engaging and extremely articulate hosts coming from sort of the center [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2398.56s)]
*  of British politics. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2404.88s)]
*  So Alistair Campbell is a former Downing Street director of communications and strategy. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2405.84s)]
*  And Rory Stewart, who had formerly served under David Cameron as minister for the environment. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2410.64s)]
*  He was in Theresa May's government as minister of state for international development. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2415.36s)]
*  Really, both of them extremely impressive and just bring a very interesting personal experience [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2419.36s)]
*  in sort of the game of politics. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2424.7200000000003s)]
*  But then it so happens the early elections were called for July 4th in the UK. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2426.8s)]
*  So they have lots of interesting stuff. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2431.52s)]
*  They get great guests. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2432.8s)]
*  And it's a very interesting exploration of just sort of the craft of politics. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2434.48s)]
*  But they always have a segment on what's going on in the world as well. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2437.92s)]
*  Whether it's protests in Georgia or what's happening vis-a-vis China and Europe or Russia, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2440.88s)]
*  Ukraine comes up a lot. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2447.84s)]
*  Great sort of lens to look through and to engage in what's happening and what can be [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2449.44s)]
*  done about it. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2453.52s)]
*  And then what is sort of the UK response to some of these things as well. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2454.16s)]
*  So for me, it was a refreshing way in which you can get people from different sides of [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2457.52s)]
*  the aisle to come together. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2461.7599999999998s)]
*  They're not always agreeing. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2463.04s)]
*  They both agree that Brexit was a disaster, however, but they're not always agreeing. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2464.4s)]
*  But they are extremely always civil. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2468.3199999999997s)]
*  And I love it. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2471.12s)]
*  It's like 30 to 40 minutes fly by every time I listen to it. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2472.16s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK-KLEIN Roy Stewart is such an interesting character. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2474.72s)]
*  I met him in Iraq. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2477.2799999999997s)]
*  Previous to that, he had walked through Afghanistan and wrote a book about it. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2479.52s)]
*  In Iraq, he became sort of a governor of a province, and his father had been an [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2483.8399999999997s)]
*  administrator in India. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2489.4399999999996s)]
*  And when the people in his province, he told us, began to riot, he called his father and [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2491.04s)]
*  said, what should I do? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2495.9199999999996s)]
*  And he said, well, what we did is we just shot them all. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2496.7999999999997s)]
*  RISA GOLUBOFF Oh my God. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2498.96s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK-KLEIN And he said, I don't think I can do that here. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2500.0s)]
*  I shall never forget that story. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2505.7599999999998s)]
*  He told it when I met him in Basra, and it made me laugh. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2507.9199999999996s)]
*  So, you know, he taught at Harvard, and then he became a politician. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2511.92s)]
*  He's just got a remarkable background. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2516.88s)]
*  Such a smart guy. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2519.12s)]
*  I will go listen to that one. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2520.32s)]
*  I will go find it. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2521.44s)]
*  RISA GOLUBOFF It's really worth it. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2522.16s)]
*  He had a recent hiatus, by the way, just to add to his aura, where he went [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2523.6800000000003s)]
*  offline completely and meditated for about two weeks or so. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2527.76s)]
*  And he was basically told everybody, I'm not going to be reachable. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbwc6pfKTU&t=2531.28s)]
