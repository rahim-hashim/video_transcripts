# Meddling in U.S. Elections, Florida Reels from Twin Storms, Nobel Peace Laureate to Be Named, & More
**Council on Foreign Relations - The World Next Week:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8)
*  In the coming week, U.S. intelligence officials warn of foreign meddling in the U.S. elections, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  Florida seeks to recover from back-to-back historic storms, and this year's Nobel Peace [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=6.12s)]
*  Prize winner is announced in Norway. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=10.48s)]
*  It's October 10th, 2024, and time for The World Next Week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=12.88s)]
*  I'm Bob McMahon. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Karla Ann Robbins. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  So Karla, let's kick off with that meddling mentioned. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=29.16s)]
*  On Monday, U.S. intelligence officials reported that Russia and China are targeting congressional [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=32.76s)]
*  races using a combination of fake websites, social media accounts, and so forth to spread [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  misinformation about the campaigns. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  What should we know about these threats and their scale, and how serious? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=45.72s)]
*  Let's be clear, especially in these very nervous and fraught times, that U.S. officials [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  federal government to local election officials, your neighbors, say there's been no evidence [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=55.76s)]
*  in previous elections, and they see no evidence of tampering right now in the integrity of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=61.68s)]
*  U.S. voting systems. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=66.72s)]
*  So if you're going to hear disinformation about that, they are not raising that alarm. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=68.72s)]
*  We have the benefit, of course, that there is no central election system here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=74.44s)]
*  There's nothing central to hack. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=78.4s)]
*  So we are protected from that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=80.52s)]
*  Venezuelan dictators, Smartmatic, all of that other stuff that we heard before. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=83.92s)]
*  That's not what they're talking about here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=89.04s)]
*  And that stuff was, as they delicately say, I'm not going to delicately say what it was, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=90.6s)]
*  but it was. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=96.12s)]
*  What is being tampered with is the public psyche. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=97.76s)]
*  And U.S. officials are worrying. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=102.04s)]
*  There's domestic disinformation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  There's foreign disinformation and worrying because this is breaking down trust in the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=108.48s)]
*  system and trust in each of us. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=114.32s)]
*  And they're worrying that that could manifest itself in a very physical way in the real [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=118.0s)]
*  world. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=122.32s)]
*  They're warning that in the days and weeks after the election, the dis and misinformation, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=123.32s)]
*  both foreign and once again domestically generated, and a lot of this is homegrown, could feed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=129.48s)]
*  extremist sentiments. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=134.84s)]
*  Election workers are already getting all sorts of threats. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=136.72s)]
*  And I don't want to predict violence, but we certainly need to ensure the safety of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  election officials and the safety of voters. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=142.84s)]
*  So this stuff is real, but it's not the tampering with the election machines, which is going [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  to be part of the focus of the misinformation campaigns. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=150.72s)]
*  After the shock of 2016 and the Russians messing around in social media, I think we've really [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  become inured to foreign disinformation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=159.72000000000003s)]
*  As if it's just one more cost of doing business in a social media world. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=162.88s)]
*  But US officials say it's actually getting worse by the year. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=166.76s)]
*  Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco warned in early September that this year's campaigns [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=169.6s)]
*  will be more diverse and aggressive with more actors from more countries operating in a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=174.52s)]
*  more polarized world and fueled by more technology and accelerated by AI. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=179.56s)]
*  So if you were feeling happy, don't be happy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=185.32s)]
*  US intelligence has said that Russia is the primary foreign threat once again, with efforts [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=188.96s)]
*  to bolster once again, former President Trump and weakened support for Ukraine on social [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=193.68s)]
*  media with fake websites. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=198.44s)]
*  But they're certainly not the only actor in the space. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=200.68s)]
*  Iran is believed to oppose President Trump's reelection, and they're accused of hacking [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=203.68s)]
*  and spear phishing attempts mainly against the Trump campaign, but against all the campaigns, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=208.16s)]
*  Biden and Harris as well, including trying to leak stolen material from the Trump campaign, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  which the Biden campaign pushed back. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=216.96s)]
*  The state does not believe China is meddling at the presidential level. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=218.88s)]
*  But this week, as you said, US intelligence reported that congressional races are now [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  a focus of foreign misinformation campaigns, with China and Russia the main actors, but [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=227.68s)]
*  also interestingly Cuba moving to bolster candidates they believe could advance their [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=232.56s)]
*  interests, opposing support for Taiwan, tariffs, aid to Ukraine, the embargo, Cuban embargo. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  This sort of general focus, undermining confidence in US democratic institutions and domestic [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  social cohesion, and that's where general campaign focuses on the sort of things we [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=250.36s)]
*  also hear from politicians here, immigration, the economy, Gaza. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=256.08s)]
*  And they're also warning this disinformation could be very tactical in the sense of telling [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=262.08s)]
*  people, no, actually you're voting places not on First Street, it's actually on Broad [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  Street. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=272.44s)]
*  So that's what we used to refer to as dirty tricks in elections. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=273.52s)]
*  So there's a lot here to worry about. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=276.64s)]
*  So Carla, I agree with you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=279.56s)]
*  I think the biggest impact in the landscape we are currently in is a sociological one, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=280.84s)]
*  perhaps. And I should note a recent joint briefing by CFR in Brookings and our colleague [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=286.08s)]
*  Kat Duffy and Elaine Camarca Brookings seized on that as a central area, just both the media [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=291.24s)]
*  environment, the vacuum of traditional sort of reliable media and public distrust is all [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=296.32s)]
*  adding to a real witch's brew. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=302.36s)]
*  But I'm wondering, as you were describing the different approaches from foreign actors or [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=305.0s)]
*  malign actors, it seems to be that Russia is willing to sort of be disruptive, however [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  it works, just for the sake of being disruptive, as well as having a favorite candidate. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=316.12s)]
*  China, though, is sort of going a little bit more tactical and looking out for maybe even [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=321.16s)]
*  the long game, but looking out for people who could be rising in the ranks who might have [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  it in for China. Is that correct? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=331.6s)]
*  That's their read of it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=333.44s)]
*  I always take intelligence a little bit with a grain of salt about that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  But I was intrigued by the distinction. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=337.8s)]
*  And the Iranians seem to be picked candidates on the federal level, but the Chinese and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=340.24s)]
*  Russians and Cubans are playing as well on the local level. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  I find obviously they're picking up on things. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=347.36s)]
*  They see websites, they see disinformation being pushed out on all of these things. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=349.56s)]
*  How much more transcendent is in the cacophony of misinformation that's also being pushed out [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=353.12s)]
*  by domestic actors? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't think there's any way to measure that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=359.48s)]
*  How much is foreign impact versus domestic? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=361.32s)]
*  I think the more general feeding of mistrust in the system, that's really scary. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  So is there a truth squad cavalry on the horizon or some sort of approach that US [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=370.24s)]
*  officials or laypeople can do to try to counter this? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=375.44s)]
*  Well, we've all been having this conversation since 2016 and certainly fiercely within our [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=378.8s)]
*  business, within journalism. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  But how do you deal with this? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=385.56s)]
*  Do you amplify it by pointing it out? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=387.36s)]
*  There's all sorts of debates that have gone on here. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=389.12s)]
*  What US officials are doing is that unlike in 2016, where the Obama administration made [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=391.64s)]
*  a very conscious effort not to make a big deal about it before the election, in part [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=396.08s)]
*  because they were utterly persuaded that Hillary Clinton was going to win and Donald Trump [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  was going around before the election saying that it was going to be stolen. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=404.04s)]
*  We hadn't heard that before, certainly in modern times from a candidate. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=408.04s)]
*  So they thought it was easier just not to make a big deal about it in public. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=411.72s)]
*  They're making a big deal about it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=415.76s)]
*  They have regular briefings about it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=417.08s)]
*  They're raising public awareness. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=419.0s)]
*  I think they're basically trying to say to people, be conscious of what you're hearing. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=421.6s)]
*  People don't like to be manipulated. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=426.4s)]
*  And if they're warned, someone's trying to manipulate you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=428.72s)]
*  And these are the topics you're going to be manipulated on. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=432.28s)]
*  The hope is whether you hear from the federal government or you hear it from your pastor [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=435.12s)]
*  or you hear it from your local newspaper or you hear it from a celebrity, that has the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=439.64s)]
*  potential, no matter where you come on the political spectrum, nobody likes to be yanked [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=444.84s)]
*  around. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=449.64s)]
*  So they're trying to do that by raising awareness. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=450.64s)]
*  They're also training local and state officials as well as campaign teams, if the campaign [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=453.4s)]
*  teams will accept the help on cybersecurity. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=457.96s)]
*  That's probably the biggest effort. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=460.35999999999996s)]
*  So their information insights are not hijacked. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=462.08s)]
*  And also, on the local level, election infrastructure is safe. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=465.12s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=469.64s)]
*  Really the biggest thing, this requires civic education. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=471.08s)]
*  It's got to start with kids. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=473.72s)]
*  It's not something you can effectively vaccinate an entire society against four weeks before [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=476.12s)]
*  an election. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  But the social media platforms certainly need to do their part to correct and give context [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=481.6s)]
*  to this information. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=487.0s)]
*  And instead of that getting better, it's getting worse and worse. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=488.0s)]
*  Admittedly, that's whack-a-mole. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=490.88000000000005s)]
*  But unfortunately, X, which under Elon Musk has cut fact-checking staff, reinstated banned [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  account. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=499.12s)]
*  And Musk himself, with a couple of hundred million followers, regularly uses his own [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=500.12s)]
*  account to boost these voter fraud conspiracies and other disinformation. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=504.56s)]
*  So that's a really grim development. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=508.28s)]
*  Social media is not helping with it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=511.24s)]
*  But all is not necessarily lost. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=513.68s)]
*  On this notion of people not getting manipulated means I think we can all do our part here [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=516.08s)]
*  and raise the warning of if something starts stinking, you say, they're yanking you around [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=521.64s)]
*  here. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=528.48s)]
*  And if you hear a false story, I know I don't usually sound so, here's a public service [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=529.48s)]
*  announcement from the world next week. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=534.1800000000001s)]
*  But if you hear a false story, check the impulse to share it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=535.84s)]
*  Even if you think you're sharing it to point out its absurdity, don't push that button. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  And I would note we at CFR.org are assiduously tracking the positions of Kamala Harris and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=545.12s)]
*  Donald Trump and linking to primary sources to their own words wherever possible. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  Certainly not sharing any sort of secondhand or iffy information, but with a focus on a [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=556.2s)]
*  foreign policy prism. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=562.32s)]
*  But I do think, as you say, everybody's got to do their part and stop spreading rumors [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=563.5600000000001s)]
*  so promiscuously. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  Is that the first time we've had the word promiscuous on the world next week? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=569.1600000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  Sorry, I was waiting for the right moment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=573.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a good time. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  Bob, let's shift to the series of storms that are battering the South. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  As we're recording Thursday morning, the sun has come up over Florida and we're getting [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=580.5400000000001s)]
*  a fuller sense of the destruction wrought by Milton. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=584.64s)]
*  And this is the second massive hurricane to hit the Southeastern U.S. in two weeks. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=588.04s)]
*  I used to live in Miami, which has twice now been spared. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=591.92s)]
*  I don't want to jinx it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=595.4799999999999s)]
*  But we know hurricanes in Miami and Milton was unusual in two ways. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  It started in the Gulf, not the Atlantic, and it spawned a lot of tornadoes. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said that at least 116 tornado warnings were issued. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=606.56s)]
*  A lot of people need help here. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=611.3599999999999s)]
*  They need help from Helene. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=612.8s)]
*  They need help from Milton. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=614.04s)]
*  Are FEMA and other agencies up to the task ahead? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=615.68s)]
*  Well, they are hard pressed at the moment. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  As you say, back to back storms like this of this size and magnitude, and we're still [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=620.52s)]
*  getting a grip on what Milton wrought, but these are not usual. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=624.76s)]
*  And the second one in particular was hitting a very populated area. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=629.52s)]
*  There were more than 7 million people put on warning notice to hunker down, to leave, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=632.4399999999999s)]
*  to go to safe terrain and so forth. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=637.36s)]
*  Last I saw, close to 3 million people were without power in Florida. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=639.88s)]
*  And this storm was hitting as there were active efforts to try to still clean up and help [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=643.84s)]
*  out from what Helene wrought. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=650.0400000000001s)]
*  By the way, they are still looking for missing people and survivors. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=652.44s)]
*  There are at least 230 people killed by that storm, and that's the most since Katrina. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=656.36s)]
*  So almost 20 years since the storm of that lethality. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=661.24s)]
*  And Milton, we're still getting a grip on how much rain it dumped. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=666.0s)]
*  Helene was notable for, especially as it got inland, just the torrents of water that were [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=669.84s)]
*  dumped, unbelievable amounts. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=674.64s)]
*  And so you have places like Asheville, North Carolina, seemingly safely inland with a pleasant [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=677.48s)]
*  river running through it and a historic district and a real hub for people to come and spend [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  time in underwater. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  We have good friends who live there who were worried that they might not get their own [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=690.98s)]
*  water restored by the end of the year. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  So these are the types of things that FEMA was already in the grips of dealing with. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=696.56s)]
*  And then you have Milton coming. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=700.4s)]
*  One of the metrics that caught my eye was in St. Petersburg, Florida. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  It registered more than 18 inches of rain, which represented a one in 1,000 year rainfall [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=705.92s)]
*  event for that area. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=710.88s)]
*  Tampa, which was an area of real concern given the potential for surges that could affect [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=712.5999999999999s)]
*  a really populated area, actually was able to avoid the worst of it by most accounts. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=717.88s)]
*  It still, though, registered wind gusts of more than 100 miles per hour. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=723.12s)]
*  The roof of Tropicana Field was ripped off. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=726.68s)]
*  It was supposed to be a makeshift shelter for first responders. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=729.2s)]
*  So this was wind, this was surge, this was rainfall, a big storm that blew across the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  midsection of Florida and then took off, as you say, and is now out to sea. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=737.88s)]
*  But its provenance in the Gulf, as you say, a very rare thing, this west to east movement [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=743.52s)]
*  across the Gulf, by the accounts of meteorologists, it was able to gain strength from the really [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=747.48s)]
*  high temperatures, unusually high temperatures of the Gulf. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=753.08s)]
*  So somewhere off of Cancun, it spun up, it built strength, and then it surged in strength [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=755.8000000000001s)]
*  in a way that has only been seen a few times in recorded recent history. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=761.6s)]
*  So much so that they were, like meteorologists, recorded being overwhelmed with emotion as [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=766.88s)]
*  they saw what was happening with the power of the storm. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=771.2s)]
*  Again, it downgraded to category three by the time it hit landfall, which is, by the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  way, what Katrina was when it hit. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=778.6400000000001s)]
*  But still, it's able to produce a lot of devastation and destruction. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=780.6s)]
*  And back to your original question, FEMA is already sort of low in staffing. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=784.44s)]
*  There was a report by the Government Accountability Office last year that about 35% of its positions [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=789.32s)]
*  were unfilled, partly because of this surge in disaster activity, as well as things like [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=794.4s)]
*  burnout and attrition, again, amplified by disaster activity. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=799.62s)]
*  What's been a little bit weird so far in this whole thing, and again, the immediacy of the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=803.8000000000001s)]
*  moment is what commands attention for understandable reasons, but you're hearing very little about [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=808.08s)]
*  this human-caused climate change, human-caused factors contributing to climate change as [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  being something that maybe people should take more seriously, including from the campaign [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=818.24s)]
*  trail. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=821.6s)]
*  There's more other kinds of disinformation, especially coming from, you have Republican [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=822.6s)]
*  lawmakers like Marjorie Taylor Greene saying these are storms that are cooked up by Democrats [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=826.9000000000001s)]
*  created, which caused President Biden to sort of single that out for criticism. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=831.72s)]
*  They also singled out President Trump for spreading disinformation about money going [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=836.2s)]
*  to migrants rather than to emergency needs, which is not true. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=840.76s)]
*  FEMA has pushed back on that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=844.36s)]
*  Republicans, we should note, especially on the local level, have pushed back on a lot [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=845.96s)]
*  of this. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=848.72s)]
*  So there's a lot of concern. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=849.72s)]
*  You have an agency that's trying to do everything it can to just help people out, and it's got [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=850.72s)]
*  to also field sort of rumors and falsehoods because we're in a political season. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=855.44s)]
*  So it's just a really difficult time. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=860.08s)]
*  My heart goes out to the people who are affected by this, but also for the relief workers who [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=862.0s)]
*  are just trying to bring help in a difficult time. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=866.72s)]
*  And we still have some time left in the hurricane season, so let's hope there's nothing else [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=869.88s)]
*  of this size brewing. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=873.52s)]
*  But as some pointed out, this was a big storm. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=875.32s)]
*  It wasn't the big storm in the centuries. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=878.0s)]
*  That should make people worried as well. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=880.08s)]
*  Yes, we still have a place in Miami, so I worry about it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=882.16s)]
*  I worry about it with shutters closed, but I worry about it every single time it happens. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=885.84s)]
*  I think to myself, yes. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=890.48s)]
*  So I thought it's intriguing that this hasn't fed the climate change debate, you would think, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=892.6s)]
*  or certainly fed the argument for why we should be worrying about climate change. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=898.2s)]
*  It seems to be the way it's been playing in the election is that it has fed more disinformation. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=901.5600000000001s)]
*  But there's also one other topic, the one that we've talked about frequently, which [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=907.4s)]
*  is the funding debate. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=911.36s)]
*  And there's been a lot of concern that there isn't enough money there. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=913.88s)]
*  Under a continuing resolution, small business administration is saying it doesn't have [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=917.24s)]
*  enough money. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=922.12s)]
*  Obviously, small businesses, a lot of them are going to be wiped out by this. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=923.12s)]
*  They need help from the federal government. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=926.48s)]
*  A lot of people are hurting out there. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=927.96s)]
*  I saw this morning that Speaker Johnson says he's not going to bring anybody back before [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=929.88s)]
*  the election, and he'll just have to wait until afterwards. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=934.0s)]
*  And there's this debate, yes, there's enough money, there's not enough money. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=937.44s)]
*  Money is an important thing to help people get back their lives together. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=941.0s)]
*  Why is there even a question about coming back and doing what people need to have done? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=944.68s)]
*  This is the moment. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=949.04s)]
*  There's a lot of things people can do for themselves, but when something is this big, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=950.68s)]
*  they really do need, they need help from Washington. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=953.9599999999999s)]
*  And Speaker Johnson pointed to his own experience as a Louisiana lawmaker dealing with these [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=957.88s)]
*  issues as saying it's a matter of timing and it takes time to find out what the true needs [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  are. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=968.4s)]
*  But it would be helpful to know that the government stands ready to jump in and provide even some [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=969.4s)]
*  confidence building stopgap money. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=973.56s)]
*  There seems to be some sort of maneuver that could be enacted that would not require them [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=975.92s)]
*  to come back, by the way, and there is some sort of procedure that would allow them to [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=979.76s)]
*  provide some sort of tranche of money. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=983.56s)]
*  I'm not sure whether that's being entertained seriously at this point, Carla, but there [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=985.4s)]
*  seem to be other paths for this. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=989.04s)]
*  Again, it's really unfortunate that this has become this political point scoring exercise [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=991.56s)]
*  at a time when the country really needs the politicians to be grownups and to just deal [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=996.36s)]
*  with the problem at hand because it's going to continue to be a problem. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1001.08s)]
*  Let's also note that this storm caused President Biden to postpone a really important trip [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1004.6s)]
*  to work with allies and to meet up with allies to shore up support for Ukraine, the Rammstein [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1008.96s)]
*  meeting in Germany. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1014.84s)]
*  That's not happening and possibly it gets rescheduled, I'm not sure, but he basically [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1016.2s)]
*  had to scuttle that as well as his first trip, the first trip by any American president almost [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1021.72s)]
*  10 years to Africa, to Angola. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1025.2s)]
*  So these have consequences, these storms. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1027.28s)]
*  They are funding challenges, but these should be things that the government can take on [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1029.64s)]
*  and take on in a straightforward way. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1034.0s)]
*  The idea that they're not coming back because they want to be on the campaign trail. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1036.72s)]
*  Do your job. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1040.68s)]
*  Well, let's talk about the lofty chambers of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, Carla, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1041.68s)]
*  in that shortly after this podcast drops, there should be an announcement, sometimes [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1047.68s)]
*  there's not, but there should be an announcement, there usually is, of a new Nobel Peace Laureate. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1051.2s)]
*  The Laureate receives a prize of more than a million dollars. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1055.48s)]
*  It's a global recognition, a platform, should they decide to use it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1059.6s)]
*  There have been some really outstanding recent candidates you can point to, such as Malala [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1062.9199999999998s)]
*  Yousafzai for her ongoing work to advocate for girls' access to education and opportunity. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1067.12s)]
*  There have also been really questionable ones, another recent one being the Ethiopian Prime [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1073.1999999999998s)]
*  Minister Abiy Ahmed, who in the short span afterwards drove a conflict that really laid [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1076.84s)]
*  waste to the country's northern Tigray region. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1083.4399999999998s)]
*  So what can you say about how the Nobel Foundation arrives at these decisions, Carla, and do [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1086.28s)]
*  they even matter? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1091.84s)]
*  They don't always get it right. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1092.84s)]
*  And at times they have gotten notoriously wrong. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1095.6399999999999s)]
*  Henry Kissinger and Lee Duck Toe in 1973, certainly high on my list of getting it wrong. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1099.6s)]
*  But for all that, I pay a lot of attention because they do get it right. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1106.8s)]
*  Even the 73 one, they were seemingly trying to drive a process that was going to end a [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1111.68s)]
*  nasty war. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1115.88s)]
*  And driving a process is a big part of what they do and what the committee decides. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1117.64s)]
*  Winning a Nobel can draw global attention and support to incredibly courageous people [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1122.1200000000001s)]
*  and support and attention to important causes, like the 1997 prize to the international campaign [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1127.68s)]
*  to ban landmines, which I think really sort of fixed the campaign in many countries and [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1133.92s)]
*  many people's minds and hearts. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1139.64s)]
*  I really love it, Bob, when we get to do these sort of questions because I learned some of [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1142.72s)]
*  the background of things that I should know and I sort of do know, but I really don't [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1146.56s)]
*  know until we start to do the research on this. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1150.68s)]
*  So the first question we asked was, why did Alfred Nobel, who was the Swedish born but [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1153.8s)]
*  mainly raised out of, I think in Russia, a lot of it, Swedish born chemist and inventor [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1158.68s)]
*  of dynamite who endowed the prizes, why did he decide that this one prize, the Peace Prize, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1163.84s)]
*  would be awarded by a Norwegian committee when all the other prizes are awarded in Sweden? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1168.8s)]
*  So according to the Nobel organization, he never explained it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1174.32s)]
*  But the best guess is that while Nobel was Swedish, for his whole life, Sweden and Norway [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1177.72s)]
*  were in a union. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1183.08s)]
*  That only ended after he died in 1905. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1184.7s)]
*  And Nobel may have been impressed by the Norwegian parliament's strong interest in the late [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1187.2s)]
*  19th century in finding peaceful solutions to international disputes, which I think is [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1192.08s)]
*  really interesting because I tend to think of the Swedes as the peace-minded ones. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1196.0s)]
*  But there you have it for that time period. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1200.24s)]
*  How does anyone get chosen? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1202.88s)]
*  This is really an opaque process. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1204.44s)]
*  According to the Nobel organization, nominations can come from government officials, from members [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1207.0s)]
*  of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1212.0s)]
*  International Board of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, university professors. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1217.48s)]
*  I wonder if I can do that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1220.52s)]
*  I teach now. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1221.92s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1222.92s)]
*  I've been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and others. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1223.92s)]
*  This year, the Norwegian Nobel Institute has registered 286 candidates, 197 individuals [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1226.92s)]
*  and 89 organizations. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1232.44s)]
*  But we won't find out who they are for at least 50 years if they decide to release it. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1234.8600000000001s)]
*  So it's going to be a long time. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1239.02s)]
*  As for who is on the committee, that isn't a secret. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1240.92s)]
*  It's chosen by the Norwegian parliament, which explains why this can, as you noticed, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1244.24s)]
*  be fundamentally a very political message-sending prize. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1249.0s)]
*  I looked up the current committee members. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1253.0400000000002s)]
*  The chair is also the general secretary of Penn, Norway. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1255.0400000000002s)]
*  The vice chair is a foreign policy scholar and newspaper columnist. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1258.92s)]
*  We like that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1262.3200000000002s)]
*  There you go. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1263.3200000000002s)]
*  For political diversity, there are politicians from the Labour, Conservative and Centre parties, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1264.4s)]
*  including a woman who opposed the EU. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1269.24s)]
*  So it's a sort of diverse and interesting group here. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1271.52s)]
*  I also spent a bit of time, I actually got totally into this as you know I do, looking [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1274.96s)]
*  at acceptance speeches, which I highly recommend. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1279.96s)]
*  There's so much grim out there, but if you really want to feel good about the human spirit, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1282.52s)]
*  it's really worth looking at some of these acceptance speeches. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1287.1200000000001s)]
*  You mentioned Malala. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1290.44s)]
*  She won a decade ago for championing girls' education and almost dying for the cause. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1292.0s)]
*  She's the youngest person to win. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1297.24s)]
*  She was 17 then. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1298.88s)]
*  And in this really charming speech, she jokes that while she wants world peace, she was [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1300.72s)]
*  still fighting with her younger brothers who were sitting in the audience watching and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1304.64s)]
*  laughing. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1308.24s)]
*  The 2021 winners, Maria Ressa, you know, founder of the Rappler News site in the Philippines [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1310.1200000000001s)]
*  at a period of time when journalists were getting killed right and left. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1315.0s)]
*  Hugely courageous. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1318.6s)]
*  Incredibly courageous. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1319.6s)]
*  Incredibly courageous and a wonderful speech. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1320.6s)]
*  But she also shared it with Dmitry Muratov, who was the co-founder and editor of Novaya [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1322.16s)]
*  Gazeta in Russia, which suspended publication after the invasion of Ukraine and just last [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1327.1200000000001s)]
*  year was declared by the Russian authorities to be a foreign agent. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1332.34s)]
*  And these are really courageous people. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1334.84s)]
*  2007, the Nobel Peace Prize went to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and to Al Gore for [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1337.52s)]
*  raising global awareness of manmade climate change. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  It's so extraordinary now, although not so extraordinary given the politics here, that [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1345.4799999999998s)]
*  there was even a question about the manmade causes of climate change and they raised incredible [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1349.6399999999999s)]
*  awareness. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1354.08s)]
*  I always sort of thought that Al Gore in part got it also for peacefully stepping aside [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1355.08s)]
*  after the 2000 elections. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1360.7199999999998s)]
*  And Martin Luther King. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1363.6799999999998s)]
*  I watched, there's so many more, obviously Nelson Mandel and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1365.16s)]
*  all that, but Martin Luther King in 1964 for civil rights and social justice, just four [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1368.88s)]
*  years before his assassination. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1373.8400000000001s)]
*  So lots to watch there and I really recommend watching some of these speeches. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1375.64s)]
*  Bob, it's time to discuss our audience figure of the week. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1379.16s)]
*  This is a figure listeners vote on every Tuesday and Wednesday at CFR underscore org's Instagram [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1383.96s)]
*  story. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1388.96s)]
*  And this week our audience selected Slovakia Prime Minister vows to block Ukraine NATO [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1390.16s)]
*  bid. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1395.28s)]
*  Why is he so adamantly against Ukraine's admission and is this even on the table right now? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1396.28s)]
*  You know, it's sort of on a side table with some of the other, you know, main dinner offerings [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1401.28s)]
*  that are not going to be dealt with anytime soon. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1406.4s)]
*  I feel like he felt compelled to mention it in the course of some other discussions that [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1408.72s)]
*  are going on, including the fact that Slovakia, it was confirmed that Ukraine will not renew [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1414.1200000000001s)]
*  an agreement that allows Slovakia to receive Russian gas that transits Ukraine, which was [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1419.8999999999999s)]
*  a really important source of energy. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1424.1399999999999s)]
*  Although Slovakia has known this for a while, this was going to happen. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1425.62s)]
*  Also you should notice a little known aspect that despite Russia's invasion, Ukraine was [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1429.1s)]
*  allowing Russia to get revenues from the transit of gas on its territory to countries like [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1433.3799999999999s)]
*  Slovakia and Hungary. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1439.3799999999999s)]
*  That's not going to happen anymore after the end of this year. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  It wasn't necessarily a spiteful comment, though. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1443.1799999999998s)]
*  Fico was quick to point out that they still would strongly support Ukraine's EU membership. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1445.42s)]
*  Fico has been in his party known as Smir has been a strong... [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1450.7s)]
*  It really sounds like a James Bond super villain. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1455.38s)]
*  It's just a few words, a few letters short of Smirsh. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1457.78s)]
*  Yes, it had actually campaigned on and won on a vow to sort of make amends with Russia [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1461.02s)]
*  to be more of a pacifying role to echo what some of the Hungarian leader Orbán has been [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1467.1000000000001s)]
*  saying about Russia. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1471.78s)]
*  And so he basically came out and said, as long as I am head of the Slovak government, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1473.92s)]
*  I will direct MPs under my control never to agree to Ukraine's joining NATO. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1478.0s)]
*  And that could be up to 2027, although he previously had to cut short a term because [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1481.96s)]
*  of all sorts of scandals brewing. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1487.24s)]
*  So let's not rule that out necessarily. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1489.28s)]
*  But again, he was in support of EU membership for Ukraine. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1491.96s)]
*  And maybe it's just a statement he can make at this moment because it was not on the table. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1496.02s)]
*  Sort of a, you know, it gains him a little bit of ground for anything else he wants to [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1499.76s)]
*  do potentially bargaining with Russia on energy, who knows. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1503.88s)]
*  It should also be noted, you know, he met with the Ukrainian officials this week and [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1508.02s)]
*  had said they should work together on common cause on an energy hub for the region. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1511.88s)]
*  So I think they were trying to say things and trying to be a bit more collegial and [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1516.64s)]
*  neighborly. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1521.6000000000001s)]
*  They share a hundred kilometer long border. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1522.6000000000001s)]
*  But it certainly wasn't great for Ukraine to hear that at a time when, as I said, Zelensky [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1524.28s)]
*  even though he didn't go to the Romstein group meeting, he's going all over Europe in the [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1530.0400000000002s)]
*  next couple of days. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1533.1200000000001s)]
*  He just met with Kirch Stalmer. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1534.1200000000001s)]
*  He's going down to Italy. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1535.5600000000002s)]
*  He's going to meet the Pope. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1536.5600000000002s)]
*  He's going to meet with Macron. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1537.5600000000002s)]
*  He's going to meet with Macron. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1538.5600000000002s)]
*  He met with Balkan leaders at one of their summits just the other day. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1540.16s)]
*  So a huge amount of diplomacy going on, as we've discussed many, many times. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1543.4s)]
*  And the new incoming NATO leader, Mark Rutte, has been strongly in support of their membership. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1547.72s)]
*  He's trying to consolidate that as much as possible and get this desperately needed aid [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1553.2800000000002s)]
*  at a time when Russia is pushing its advantages on the Eastern Front and what looks like it's [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1557.28s)]
*  going to be a very cold winter on top of everything else. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1562.24s)]
*  It is interesting that he's supporting EU memberships and he's doing all these other [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1565.24s)]
*  things, which does raise this very interesting question that maybe he is not as fiercely [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1571.4s)]
*  opposed. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1577.48s)]
*  And when you think about it, Joe Biden's opposed to it too. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1578.48s)]
*  So Hungary came around. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1581.0s)]
*  Turkey came around. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1584.1200000000001s)]
*  There's always a lot of bargaining in these things and we'll see. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1585.36s)]
*  We certainly know that Zelensky wants this because he wants a clear path and he wants [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1588.8s)]
*  a clear commitment. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1593.0s)]
*  We believe it's part of his victory plan, which has yet to be unveiled. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1594.1599999999999s)]
*  I think his next step is going to be to unveil the victory plan because he's not on the front [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1598.6399999999999s)]
*  pages with everything else that's going on. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1603.12s)]
*  And time is running out for him. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1606.0s)]
*  It really is. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1607.52s)]
*  It's really a scary thing. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  So thank you for explaining that because I took this to be a very obstructionist comment [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1609.8799999999999s)]
*  and we don't know yet. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1615.04s)]
*  This may be less of an obstructionist comment than it sounded like, which I'm surprised [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1616.72s)]
*  because I expect Fidesz to be very obstructionist. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1620.28s)]
*  There's more nuance than we realize in that part of the world. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1623.28s)]
*  At the same time, Fidesz also, by the way, is a leftist populist, not a rightist populist, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1625.76s)]
*  which we're seeing a surge of in other countries, including Austria most recently in their elections. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1630.6s)]
*  Can you really tell the difference? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1635.12s)]
*  There are differences by degrees. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1637.1200000000001s)]
*  There are some things that are pretty common, though, and one of them seems to be a dovish [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1638.4s)]
*  inclination towards Russia. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1643.32s)]
*  So again, maybe just a bit of concern about that war spilling across the borders a bit [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1644.64s)]
*  more has gotten them very concerned, whereas they see the EU as more of a stabilizing factor, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1650.4s)]
*  although Russia's no fan of EU membership either. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1655.96s)]
*  Well, I want the last word on this. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1658.08s)]
*  I don't want the word dove and Putin's Russia in the same sentence. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1660.16s)]
*  You're really parsing the vocabulary today, Karla. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1663.96s)]
*  Duly noted. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRSnhmLSQ8&t=1667.4s)]
