# Sandy Hook Families Push For Change, Decade After Shooting
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M)
*  This coming week will mark 10 years since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=0.0s)]
*  where 20 first graders and six educators were murdered. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  In December 2012, the shooting sparked immediate and passionate pleas for gun reforms, which [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=13.0s)]
*  have mostly gone unanswered. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=18.48s)]
*  This week, President Biden became the first president to speak at the National Vigil for [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=20.98s)]
*  all victims of gun violence, which honored the more than one million Americans who have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=24.8s)]
*  died from gun violence since Sandy Hook. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=30.84s)]
*  His remarks come just one month after a gunman opened fire inside an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=35.04s)]
*  Springs. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=39.88s)]
*  Biden used the opportunity to once again push for an assault weapons ban. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=40.88s)]
*  The attempt to ban assault weapons, a whole range of things that are just common sense, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=47.0s)]
*  just simple common sense. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=54.0s)]
*  But you know, we did it before. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=56.0s)]
*  We did it, and guess what? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  It worked. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=63.32s)]
*  The number of violent and mass murders reduced were significant. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=64.32s)]
*  A lot of people's lives were saved. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=69.64s)]
*  You know, we can do it again. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=74.12s)]
*  Former President Obama, who of course cried when talking about the children murdered in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=78.60000000000001s)]
*  Newtown, Connecticut, attended a Sandy Hook Promise event at the beginning of this week. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  So I will admit it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=89.68s)]
*  I still get angry every time I read about the latest senseless shooting, whether it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=90.92s)]
*  or not. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=99.28s)]
*  It is in a church or a synagogue, in a grocery store or on a college campus or in a home [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=100.28s)]
*  or on a city street. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=105.6s)]
*  I still feel anger. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=111.64s)]
*  And I hope you do, too. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, earlier, I spoke with Nicole Hockley. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  She is the co-founder and CEO of Sandy Hook Promise. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=121.76s)]
*  She started the foundation after she chose to transform her grief over the loss of her [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=125.56s)]
*  son Dylan, who was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, into action. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=129.76s)]
*  Nicole, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=134.76s)]
*  Former President Obama has said that he was deeply impacted by the Sandy Hook shooting. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=139.28s)]
*  We all remember the images of when it happened and hearing him speak and how emotional he [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=143.92s)]
*  was about it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=148.88s)]
*  And it's obvious when you hear him talk about it, even till today, it has impacted him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=149.88s)]
*  How did it feel to have him speak at your event this week? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=154.2s)]
*  It was wonderful having President Obama at the Sandy Hook Promise event. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  This is a day he speaks of often, not just as the president, but as a father. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=162.72s)]
*  And he was there again as a president and as a father, meeting with my family and the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=166.92s)]
*  Barden and Sherlock families backstage and spending time with each of us. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=172.48s)]
*  And the words that he said are so true. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=175.92s)]
*  He's still very saddened and angry about what happened and the lack of Senate action afterwards. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=178.52s)]
*  So it meant a great deal for him to be there and share his reflections 10 years later. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=185.04s)]
*  As you said, it's been 10 years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=190.92s)]
*  And when we just look back at this year, you had mayors from 70 cities that experienced [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=192.7s)]
*  mass shootings. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=196.84s)]
*  This year alone have sent letters to Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell urging them to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=198.0s)]
*  act on gun control legislation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=203.6s)]
*  They write in part, quote, How much more death and destruction must our residents and our [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=206.44s)]
*  communities endure before the Senate acts? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=211.16s)]
*  The time to pass the assault weapons ban and the background check expansion act is now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=214.84s)]
*  I think most Americans would agree with that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=220.04s)]
*  Do you think any more federal action will actually happen or is it up to the states [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=223.04s)]
*  now to lead this fight? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=227.64s)]
*  I think that there will be federal action, but I don't think it'll be as quickly as people [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=230.64s)]
*  would like it to be. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=235.24s)]
*  I do think things are going to happen more on a state level in terms of student safety, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=236.24s)]
*  gun safety, mental health and wellness. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=241.24s)]
*  And I do think that we need to also remember that there's a lot that we can do in our [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  communities. We can't sit around and wait until policy policy makers agree with us on [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=247.4s)]
*  issues and until they're elected or reelected. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=253.28s)]
*  This is important that we prioritize the lives that are at stake right now and every day [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=256.48s)]
*  across the country and press our current politicians for action, but also take community [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=262.48s)]
*  based actions to help look after ourselves. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm curious if you are watching what is happening with the Supreme Court with any cause of concern [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=270.6s)]
*  because the evolution of the Supreme Court, I'd like for you to talk about that for a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=274.92s)]
*  moment. It has obviously evolved into this super conservative majority on the bench and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  any potential gun control legislation is likely to be challenged in the courts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=284.04s)]
*  How concerned are you about it? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=290.16s)]
*  What are your thoughts about the way the Supreme Court has signaled the issue of gun control [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=291.76s)]
*  in this country? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=298.68s)]
*  Well, I think the Supreme Court has made some surprising decisions of late on multiple issues [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=299.68s)]
*  and some that are completely out of line with what the general population thinks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=306.48s)]
*  So I think if an issue of gun control or gun violence prevention does pass in Congress [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=311.68s)]
*  and then makes its way to the Supreme Court, it would be very difficult for them to go [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=316.56s)]
*  against the will of the people and their elected officials. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=321.04s)]
*  So I think it's one we have to continue to watch and remind the Supreme Court that they [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=323.44s)]
*  are there to hold up the Constitution, but also in a way that is not biased towards their [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=328.28s)]
*  own political leanings. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=335.24s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about Alex Jones for a moment. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=337.92s)]
*  He's become so intertwined with the Sandy Hook story. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=340.56s)]
*  He has had a massive court loss, several massive court losses actually, totaling more than [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=345.2s)]
*  a billion dollars regarding the misinformation he spread about Sandy Hook. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=349.72s)]
*  Do you think that was a turning point for you and other Sandy Hook families to see someone [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=356.12s)]
*  like him held accountable for the false lies that he spread about what happened on that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=362.04s)]
*  day? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=368.44000000000005s)]
*  There was a certain sense of justice for me in that courtroom that day. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=369.88000000000005s)]
*  But really, I think this is a turning point for conspiracy theorists and also the war [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  on misinformation that's happening in our country right now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think this sent an important message that if you willingly and maliciously spread [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  false information for your own personal agenda, in his case, profit, money, that hurts others, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=387.52s)]
*  that you will be held accountable. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=394.08s)]
*  So I hope that this is a turning point for that spread of misinformation and that people [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  realize there are consequences for these actions. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=401.12s)]
*  So stop doing it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=404.0s)]
*  That's what I hope this was all about. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  Of course, we all know that you lost your son tragically in the Newtown shooting, Dylan. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=409.23999999999995s)]
*  Before we go, if you don't mind, I'd love to hear some memories of Dylan and how he [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=415.23999999999995s)]
*  has inspired you to keep fighting nearly a decade later. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=420.32s)]
*  Yeah, Dylan was the center of love in our family. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  He was a very loving little boy. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=428.56s)]
*  He was absolutely gorgeous and had this gigantic smile and this laugh and sing songy voice. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=431.8s)]
*  And people would tickle him just to hear him laugh because he was so sweet. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=436.88s)]
*  He was autistic, so he had issues with speech delay. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=442.24s)]
*  And he liked playing with the other kids, but he did not understand the rules. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=445.8s)]
*  That didn't stop him from playing with them. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=449.48s)]
*  And they always included him. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=451.52s)]
*  And when I think about some of the work that Sandy Hook Promise has done in terms of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=453.0s)]
*  creating more inclusive school communities where people look out for each other, where [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=457.88s)]
*  people realize if someone who needs help, that they step up and do something about it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=461.68s)]
*  There's a lot of Dylan's spirit in there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=465.88s)]
*  And for us, he called himself a butterfly once because he jumped up and down and flapped [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=467.6s)]
*  so much. And I talked at his funeral about the butterfly theory that one butterfly [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=473.16s)]
*  flapping its wings can cause change on the other side of the world. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=478.52s)]
*  And Dylan and all the other butterflies across the world that have that need protecting [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=482.12s)]
*  and that have been lost to gun violence or other, they're the ones that are flapping to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=487.4s)]
*  create this change that we're going to see. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=491.04s)]
*  Nicole Hockley, I know it's always hard to talk about this around the holidays, but thank [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  you so much. And I can assure you, your beautiful butterfly is changing the world [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=499.56s)]
*  through your actions and the actions of so many other families. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lk2H2J203M&t=505.36s)]
