# Chef José Andrés is cooking meals in Turkey for earthquake survivors
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI)
*  Right now, in Turkey and Syria, every moment counts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=0.0s)]
*  It has been six days since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake and a devastating aftershock hit [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=7.28s)]
*  the region. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=12.64s)]
*  The combined death toll has now topped 25,000, with more than 22,000 killed and over 80,000 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=13.64s)]
*  injured in Turkey alone. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=20.84s)]
*  That is according to the Turkish health minister. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=22.88s)]
*  been working tirelessly around the clock to find any remaining survivors amongst the rubble. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=26.88s)]
*  Overnight in Adyaman, there was a miraculous rescue of a 33-year-old mother and her six-year-old [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=32.64s)]
*  daughter. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=38.76s)]
*  Ozelem Yilmaz and her daughter Zelia were pulled out from the rubble alive by Turkish [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=39.76s)]
*  miners and an American rescue team after being trapped more than 100 hours. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  It is a true bright spot in a very, very dark moment for the region, which has suffered [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=50.64s)]
*  what the United Nations' aid chief calls the region's worst event in 100 years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=55.96s)]
*  Earlier today, I spoke with the founder of World Central Kitchen, Chef Jose Andras, who [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=61.04s)]
*  is on the ground with his team, delivering thousands of hot meals to survivors. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=65.52s)]
*  Chef Jose Andras, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=72.76s)]
*  You and World Central Kitchen, you are now on the ground in Turkey. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=75.56s)]
*  In two cities near the epicenter of the earthquake, can you tell us what you are seeing at this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=80.08s)]
*  moment? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=85.72s)]
*  Well, I'm talking to you from Al-Bistan, which is probably remote. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=86.72s)]
*  It's one city that has been really devastated. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=96.52s)]
*  And you mentioned two cities, but technically we are already feeding around 16, 17 different [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=100.44s)]
*  towns and villages. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=108.88s)]
*  So I am talking from this kitchen in a factory where they used to use it to feed the employees. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=111.2s)]
*  But something amazing happened. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=122.16s)]
*  This group of chefs from Istanbul came with the help of friends and they began cooking [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=123.64s)]
*  meals. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=129.88s)]
*  They are doing here a few thousand meals a day and they are distributing the meals through [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=130.88s)]
*  different places around this town. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=134.92s)]
*  Very much this is what's happening right now all across Turkey, where obviously the government [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=138.68s)]
*  is doing the best they can to be feeding people in the camps that they began building to host [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=145.68s)]
*  the people that lost their homes or people that they are afraid to leave in their homes [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=152.56s)]
*  because they feel the building is going to crash. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=156.2s)]
*  The amazing thing is that all across this area, many, many restaurants, hotels, individuals [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=158.88s)]
*  cooking out of their homes go in the street and anywhere they start feeding. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  This is very much the entire feeding operation in Istanbul. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=171.76s)]
*  All hands on, everybody that can't cook, can't produce something is doing it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=175.48s)]
*  So more or less the food situation is under control. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  But in the next week or two weeks or three weeks, everything is going to be changing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=185.8s)]
*  because people are going to start moving, they're going to be going to other cities, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=190.12s)]
*  some cities are going to see a lot of refugees, etc. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=193.4s)]
*  We are here to adapt, to make sure that World Central Kitchen can be helping those efforts [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=197.72s)]
*  by covering the food in hospitals, by covering the food in shelters or use serving food in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=203.12s)]
*  the street when people are living literally in their cars. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=208.92s)]
*  Can you tell us about what you need? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=214.6s)]
*  How can we help you help them for those that are watching this and around the world? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Well we are right here the first day, right after the earthquake and obviously people [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=223.56s)]
*  that know World Central Kitchen, they know what we do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=229.0s)]
*  They can go to worldcentralkitchen.org. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=232.0s)]
*  Obviously, I will say to people, always look for the very good Turkish organizations that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=234.0s)]
*  you feel they are organizations that they will deliver the goods if you support them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  But they think right now the entire world has to be next to Turkey, to the Turkish people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=246.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=252.83999999999997s)]
*  I remember in 2010 when I arrived a few weeks later to Perprense in Haiti, there was one [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  earthquake in one city. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  Yes, many people died, but everything was confined in that one city. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=262.91999999999996s)]
*  What you see here is 10 Hades, probably more, 10 cities, many villages, many villages that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  they were flat out. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=275.2s)]
*  Obviously, what we're going to see here is a very long reconstruction. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=277.2s)]
*  Right now the temperatures in many parts of Turkey in the area of the earthquake are under [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=281.8s)]
*  5, sometimes 10 minus Celsius degrees. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  It's super cold and that makes everything even more complicated. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=291.04s)]
*  You and World Central Kitchen, you have been on the ground, as you just mentioned. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=297.32s)]
*  You've been around the world helping victims of so many disasters and war zones. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=299.88s)]
*  What would you like the viewers, the people who are so far away from this disaster, to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=305.0s)]
*  know about the people of Turkey and how they are doing in this moment? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=310.24s)]
*  Well, what I want the people of the world to know about the people of Turkey is that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=314.48s)]
*  in the worst moments of humanity, the best of humanity shows up. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  I would love for you to meet every one of these amazing Turkish chefs that came to the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  most difficult area, probably, coming together as one. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=331.76s)]
*  This is happening everywhere. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=335.76s)]
*  So, this is the good thing, that people want to help, people want to prosper, people want [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=337.76s)]
*  to live in communities that do well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=344.44s)]
*  In emergencies, in emergencies after earthquakes, hurricanes, et cetera, we always need to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  be next to those people in any way we can. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=353.56s)]
*  Governments, NGOs, individuals, we have many people that have come here from America to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=357.32s)]
*  join our response here in Turkey. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=363.76s)]
*  Everybody can find a way to be helping, but what is obvious is that what is happening [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=367.76s)]
*  to them can happen to us. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=371.56s)]
*  And therefore, we always need to be there next to the people in their darkest hour, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=373.92s)]
*  because then in the future, maybe one day, they are the ones that will come to help us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=378.68s)]
*  Chef Jose Andras from World Central Kitchen, sir, thank you so much for your time. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=383.56s)]
*  Thank you to you and to everyone that is working with you to try and help the people of Turkey [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=389.04s)]
*  and Syria. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=394.16s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=395.16s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIAn2jOtI&t=396.16s)]
