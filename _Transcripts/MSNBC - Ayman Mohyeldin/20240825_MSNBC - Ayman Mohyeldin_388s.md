# MIT diversity data confirms 'worst fears' about end of affirmative action
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ)
*  While all eyes were on the DNC this week, MIT released some data that confirmed our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=0.0s)]
*  worst fears about the Supreme Court. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=4.8s)]
*  The university's incoming class will be significantly less diverse than in previous years, and that's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=7.2s)]
*  thanks to last year's ruling that gutted affirmative action. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=12.48s)]
*  MIT, one of the first to release enrollment data since that ruling, says its percentage [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=15.76s)]
*  of black students dropped to 5 percent from 15 percent last year, and the percentage of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=20.7s)]
*  Hispanic and Latino students dropped to 11 percent, down from 16 percent. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=26.3s)]
*  Overall, all racial and ethnic minority groups had a decrease in enrollment, except for Asian [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=31.54s)]
*  Americans who had a 7 percent increase. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=37.28s)]
*  And the university actually saw this coming. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  It was among several universities and colleges that signed an amicus brief to the high court [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=42.540000000000006s)]
*  two years ago in support of keeping race-conscious admissions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=47.18s)]
*  Joining me now, Eddie Glaude Jr., James S. McDonald, distinguished professor at Princeton [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=51.18s)]
*  University. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=55.82s)]
*  He's also an MSNBC political analyst professor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=56.82s)]
*  It is great to see you as always. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=59.02s)]
*  So this is not a surprise to anyone. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=60.46s)]
*  I think when SCOTUS struck down affirmative action, you and others warned us about the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=62.78s)]
*  impact this would have on students of color, saying that we would begin to see a kind of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=67.98s)]
*  segregated higher education landscape. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=72.7s)]
*  Your initial reaction now that we have seen these initial new numbers from one university, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=76.06s)]
*  and what are you hearing from others in academia? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=81.34s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's great to see you, Eamon. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=85.22s)]
*  We knew this was going to happen, as you said. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  I suspect that the data will be similar at the other IVs, my own institution, Princeton, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=89.97999999999999s)]
*  Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Penn, Cornell, and the like. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=95.22s)]
*  We should probably see this across the board in terms of elite institutions and ranking [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=99.38s)]
*  or top state public institutions. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=106.42s)]
*  You know, we knew this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=109.1s)]
*  We knew the data. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=110.3s)]
*  We saw what happened in California. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=111.14s)]
*  We know just 10 years after Prop 209 was passed, only 96 freshmen, black freshmen, were admitted [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=113.58000000000001s)]
*  to a class of over 4,000 at UCLA. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=120.22s)]
*  We saw a 44% decline between 2006 and 2022 at the University of Michigan. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=123.22s)]
*  And so this was, in fact, the expected outcome. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  And what's so tragic about it, there are those folk who are reading this outcome as an example [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=132.74s)]
*  of what happens when merit is taken as the principal deciding factor, when in fact, this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=138.14s)]
*  is actually proving the opposite, Eamon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=145.33999999999997s)]
*  The New York Times professor pointed out that other schools now could feel pressure to demonstrate [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  results consistent with MITs or to reveal their admissions diversity in terms of their [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=153.14s)]
*  classes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, they could open themselves up to critics who might say that they found a way [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=159.06s)]
*  to somehow defy the Supreme Court's ban. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=163.7s)]
*  Your thoughts on this? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=167.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's going to be some downward pressure. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=169.78s)]
*  Remember, affirmative action is not an issue for the local community college. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=171.94s)]
*  It's not an issue for the service institutions, public institutions that are not the kind [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=175.62s)]
*  of rank, the top ranking schools in the state. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=184.54s)]
*  This is about who gains access to the top schools in the country. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=187.3s)]
*  And that gets us into some sticky questions, Eamon, about the inequality of the landscape [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=191.22s)]
*  of higher education that we might need to talk about. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=197.06s)]
*  But we're going to see these downward pressures. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=199.78s)]
*  And what's also not being talked about in this discussion is what's happening in secondary [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=201.78s)]
*  schools, the inequality in high schools, the inequality that's evidenced in elementary [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=206.58s)]
*  school. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=211.9s)]
*  Who gets access to Head Start? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=212.9s)]
*  Who gets access to early education? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=214.18s)]
*  And that's impacting the quality of applications that we see to these elite institutions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=216.94s)]
*  So when people just talk about it as merit, they're not paying attention to the inequality, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  the structural inequality, Eamon, that defines the landscape of American education from K [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=226.78s)]
*  through 12 up to the colleges and universities. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=232.06s)]
*  You bring up an important point about the admissions process generally, because after [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=236.22s)]
*  the ruling, you had schools revamping their recruitment and admissions process by leaning [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=240.78s)]
*  on students' application essays, making test scores optional, broadening outreach to high [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  school and low income communities, all of them trying to address this issue. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=249.78s)]
*  What other options do you see for administrators in this post-affirmative action world to try [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  to avoid this MIT result of a lack of diversity and how they can actually be effective? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=259.74s)]
*  I think they need to be courageous and really do live their values. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=265.53999999999996s)]
*  If they're committed to a diverse class. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=270.58s)]
*  Admissions processes, Eamon, are some of the most kind of contrived processes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=273.06s)]
*  Just think, just think. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=277.7s)]
*  If schools were not able to take in consideration region, most schools say on the Northeast [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  would have most of their students probably coming from the Northeast. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=287.7s)]
*  Schools weren't interested in taking into consideration athletics, legacy, whether or [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=291.53999999999996s)]
*  not you're interested in the arts or whatever, you would see a very different class because [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=298.34000000000003s)]
*  you can't take advantage of that knowledge in order to build the kind of community you [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=303.38s)]
*  need to build. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=307.94s)]
*  What does it mean that we can't take into consideration race? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  What it will mean is that they can't build the kind of diverse class that they want to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=312.82000000000005s)]
*  build. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=317.38s)]
*  We know that focusing on class alone can't address this issue. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  Part of what we have to deal with is the bad faith of these actors who are kind of pressing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=321.94s)]
*  this issue. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=326.58000000000004s)]
*  We also need to understand that this is a kind of two front assault, not only on admissions, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=327.3s)]
*  but DEI generally. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=332.18s)]
*  So even if you get admitted to these institutions, they're attacking DEI offices so that the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=333.62s)]
*  experience is not, shall we say, as welcoming, as supportive as it might be. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=339.06s)]
*  So I think institutions need to live their values and not be afraid of being sued. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=344.18s)]
*  Bring the full weight of their reputation to bear in the fight for a diverse higher [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=350.26s)]
*  education landscape. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=356.34s)]
*  Professor Eddie Glaude Jr., I can't thank you enough. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=358.17999999999995s)]
*  Such an important conversation, one we're going to follow throughout its developments [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=360.34s)]
*  and twists and turns, but greatly appreciate your voice as always, sir. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=364.17999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=366.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIyZL_I0ysQ&t=367.46s)]
