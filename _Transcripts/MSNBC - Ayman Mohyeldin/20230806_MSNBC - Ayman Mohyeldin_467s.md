# Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen: Trump’s Trial Needs to be Televised
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ)
*  Nearly 40 House Democrats are demanding Donald Trump's criminal trials be televised, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a letter to the Judicial Conference members argued for the quote, extraordinary national [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=7.88s)]
*  importance to our democratic institutions, adding, if the public is to fully accept the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=11.88s)]
*  outcome, it will be vitally important for it to witness as directly as possible how [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=16.56s)]
*  the trials are conducted, the strength of the evidence adduced and the credibility of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=21.34s)]
*  witnesses. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=27.060000000000002s)]
*  Unlike in state and local courtrooms, broadcasting proceedings in federal court is not the norm, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=28.66s)]
*  but there have been some exceptions in recent decades. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=33.34s)]
*  Joining me now is one of the signatories of that letter, Democratic Congressman Steve [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=36.5s)]
*  Cohen of Tennessee. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=40.34s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=41.34s)]
*  I thank you for making time for us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=43.18s)]
*  Let me get your thoughts by just quickly on the breaking news that we had this evening, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  the protective order that prosecutors requested against Trump last night after he posted what [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=49.94s)]
*  seemed to be a threat online. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=55.7s)]
*  Today, you had the U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkin reject Trump's request for an extension. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=58.38s)]
*  What's your reaction, sir? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=64.9s)]
*  Well, what he said, if you come after me, I'm going to go after you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=65.9s)]
*  This is the actions of a bully, of a tyrant, and that's what he is. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=70.5s)]
*  And the judge basically cautioned him about taking illegal steps. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=75.98s)]
*  Now, he doesn't know what illegal is because everything that emanates from him is perfect, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=79.7s)]
*  all right, and legal. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=84.14s)]
*  But this is dangerous to witnesses, dangerous to people that testify, and dangerous to people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=85.7s)]
*  that prosecute. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  And he's basically telling people, don't get involved, don't support this position, and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=92.02000000000001s)]
*  if you do and I get to be president, he'll get even. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=97.34s)]
*  And he will get even because, as Bill Barr said, there'll be no checks on him, and we [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=100.7s)]
*  will lose our country. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=104.54s)]
*  Let's talk about the letter you and your colleagues sent to the Judicial Conference in which you [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  make the case for this trial to be televised because of the powerful circumstances we find [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=112.58s)]
*  ourselves in. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  Why do you believe, sir, it is important that the American public bear witness to this trial [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  in real time? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=125.46s)]
*  We have seen our nation become more divided than at any time, I guess, since the Civil [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=128.46s)]
*  War. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=132.22s)]
*  It's totally divided, but it's divided now not on whether you're in favor of slavery [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=133.22s)]
*  or against slavery. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=139.7s)]
*  It's whether or not you see facts and admit that they are the truth or not. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=140.7s)]
*  We have a problem just as seeing reality and the facts and working off the same song sheet. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=144.78s)]
*  We're siloed by cable television. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=151.73999999999998s)]
*  If you watch MSNBC and CNN, you see a certain version of the news, which I think is the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=154.94s)]
*  truth. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=160.22s)]
*  And if you watch Fox or Newsmax or some of those stations, you see fiction. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=161.22s)]
*  And that's why they had multi-hundreds of millions of dollar judgments against them [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=167.38s)]
*  relying on Dominion Voting and other things on Fox. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=172.82s)]
*  And they're going to have others who are going to be found liable. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=175.66s)]
*  But we need to make sure that the people can watch this and see it on their own and not [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=178.7s)]
*  have to watch it through the eyes and ears of Fox and Newsmax, who would take Trump's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=182.98s)]
*  position and tilt and switch the perspectives to be what Trump wants and not the truth. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=188.62s)]
*  The truth needs to be seen because otherwise, if they don't accept the judgment, and I'm [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=195.58s)]
*  just assuming that the judgment is presumed innocent, but I think these guilty as al-capone [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=201.1s)]
*  as anybody could be. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=207.86s)]
*  If they don't see the trial, they may not accept you because I'm sure on Fox they would [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=210.86s)]
*  show him as being something like Florenstein gave him. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=215.46s)]
*  How concerned are you about what the reaction will be if Donald Trump is found guilty in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=220.1s)]
*  this trial and it is not televised? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=226.46s)]
*  How concerned are you that him and his followers or him and his allies may incite his followers [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=228.74s)]
*  to violence like what we saw on January the 6th? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  I definitely can see that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump does not want to go to jail. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  And his followers believe him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=243.22s)]
*  I mean, here's a man who probably makes Pinocchio look like a teller of truth. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=245.7s)]
*  He's been found indicted down three times. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=251.7s)]
*  He's been impeached twice. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=255.1s)]
*  He's been found guilty and liable in civil cases for rape, for lying to civil case, cheating [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=257.02s)]
*  charities. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=266.62s)]
*  I mean, you cheat charities, you rape women at the Burger of Goodman, and you lie about [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=267.62s)]
*  everything in the world. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=274.1s)]
*  And these people believe him as if he is a truth-seller. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=276.66s)]
*  He's not. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  So if they don't see it with their own eyes, even then I don't know if they'll accept it, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=282.66s)]
*  but you've got to hope they will accept the verdict. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  And to do that, they need to see with their own eyes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=290.22s)]
*  And I hope that Chief Justice Roberts will understand that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=292.22s)]
*  Our country is at risk. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  We are in danger of a civil war. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  We're in danger of insurrection. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=297.5s)]
*  We're in danger of just terrific, terrific things. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=298.98s)]
*  Whether he's found guilty or not. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=303.66s)]
*  And the only way I can make this lesson this would be to televised it so people would see [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=305.74s)]
*  it for themselves. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  Since you mentioned Chief Justice John Roberts, I mean, it's ultimately him and the Judicial [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  Conference who will make that decision. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=315.86s)]
*  But do you believe, given the way the Supreme Court has behaved and the way the Chief Justice [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=317.58000000000004s)]
*  has behaved and the lack of transparency when it comes to the Supreme Court, that he'd be [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=321.5s)]
*  willing to grant that transparency to the American public in this trial? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=326.38s)]
*  I certainly hope he would. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=333.26s)]
*  I mean, I think he wants the court to have a good reputation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=334.26s)]
*  Some of the things the court's done has lost it to support for the public with the no ethics [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=338.34s)]
*  laws and all the benefits that have been heaped upon Clarence Thomas and Justice Alito getting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=341.98s)]
*  fairly similar benefits and acting, you know, like it's improper even to question the ethics [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  of the Supreme Court. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=357.14s)]
*  They should not be immune from ethics laws like every other political group is. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=358.21999999999997s)]
*  So yeah, I think I hope Chief Justice Roberts is doing the right thing to protect the court's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=363.74s)]
*  integrity and the court having a low point. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=366.94s)]
*  And I think it's acceptance by the public. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=369.9s)]
*  It would be admirable for him to do this, to say the public has a right to see this [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=371.9s)]
*  and should see it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=376.38s)]
*  These are different times. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=377.38s)]
*  I mean, when the whole idea came up, he didn't have television trials. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=378.38s)]
*  We didn't have television. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=381.14s)]
*  I mean, it was newsreels, I guess. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=382.14s)]
*  But he didn't have a president like Trump. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=384.38s)]
*  We didn't have a division in this country the way it is where people can't see the truth [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=386.38s)]
*  and listen to what they're told by folks that think that Democrats are all running pizza [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=390.42s)]
*  restaurants with fronts to have human trafficking, child trafficking going on. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=395.86s)]
*  And they believe this QAnon mess. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  So this is a dangerous time in our nation. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=404.46s)]
*  And I think Chief Justice Roberts needs to recognize the court needs to take extraordinary [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=406.9s)]
*  action to protect the democracy and to protect the foundations on which the court rests. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=410.34s)]
*  And as previous scholars and others who have studied this have noted, televising the trials [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=416.38s)]
*  has not impacted either the jurors or the right of a defendant to have a fair and speedy [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=421.02s)]
*  process. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=428.5s)]
*  So really, there is no reason not to televise these trials anymore. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=429.78s)]
*  Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee, it's always a pleasure, sir. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=435.06s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=437.9s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=438.9s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkF6Pp4EpPQ&t=439.9s)]
