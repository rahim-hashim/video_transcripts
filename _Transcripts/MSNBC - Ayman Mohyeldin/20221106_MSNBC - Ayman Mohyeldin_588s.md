# Democrats Make Final Case To Voters Before Midterms
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI)
*  All right, so the first polls close in less than 72 hours. More than 39 million early [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=0.0s)]
*  ballots have already been cast. And here is President Obama just a short time ago in Philadelphia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=7.44s)]
*  Fundamental rights are on the ballot. Truth and facts and logic and reason and basic decency are [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=12.96s)]
*  on the ballot. Democracy itself is on the ballot. The stakes are high. Now, election officials in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=29.6s)]
*  swing states like Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona are making clear they are confident [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=36.24s)]
*  they can get the job done. But they are facing major challenges. There are heightened levels [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=40.88s)]
*  of threats, growing intimidation tactics, election-related lawsuits, and of course, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=47.28s)]
*  a large number of Republican candidates who are refusing to accept the election results. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=51.52s)]
*  According to Axios, election deniers are signing on as poll watchers in places like Colorado and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  Pennsylvania. The New York Times reports that at least three dozen lawyers and law firms who [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=62.56s)]
*  advance Trump's big lie are now working for Republicans in the midterms. And just this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=67.36s)]
*  week, we learned that Cleta Mitchell, the former Trump attorney who fought to overturn the 2020 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=72.4s)]
*  election results, told election groups in Michigan that her vision ahead of election day is, quote, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=77.2s)]
*  hand-to-hand combat with the left. Now, even before Tuesday, there have been unprecedented efforts [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=83.52s)]
*  to disrupt the vote, maybe more than any election in recent memory. We can safely say we just don't [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=90.56s)]
*  know what is going to happen on Tuesday. We are going to try to make sense of where we are right [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=97.12s)]
*  now with the help of secretaries of state from across the nation. Joining us now are Colorado [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Secretary of State and Chair of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State Jenna [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Griswold, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=114.48s)]
*  Oliver, and California Secretary of State Shirley Nash Weber. It's great to have all of you with us. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=119.92s)]
*  Secretary Griswold, I'd like to start with you as the chair of the Democratic Association [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=126.16s)]
*  of Secretaries of State. Talk to me about these conspiracy-fueled threats. How concerned are you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=131.12s)]
*  and how are you and others fighting back in this critical juncture? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=137.52s)]
*  Well, Christoph Eamon, thank you so much for having us on. It means so much that Americans are so [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=143.28s)]
*  focused on our elections and democracy. And honestly, talking about optimism versus [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=149.6s)]
*  pessimism, I am optimistic we are going to have a great election here in Colorado and across the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  country. That doesn't mean the challenges aren't new. We have been living under the worst attack [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=160.48s)]
*  on the right to vote in recent times. We are seeing coordinated efforts to suppress the vote, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=166.56s)]
*  intimidate voters in an unfashionable way we just haven't seen recently. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=173.04s)]
*  With that said, these secretaries of state with us tonight and across the nation [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  are standing up for American voters, are standing up for elections. And every American voter in this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  country should make their voices heard and believe you will be able to do so in free, fair, and safe [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  elections. Secretary Simon, your opponent is undoubtedly a 2020 election denier. She said in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=196.64s)]
*  a press conference in October, quote, Minnesota laws were not followed. How are you combating that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=203.84s)]
*  to your constituents and to the votes that you are trying to win? Well, I just want to put things in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=210.96s)]
*  perspective. In Minnesota, Joe Biden won the election by 230,000 votes. This was not close. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=217.2s)]
*  Yet my opponent and others who follow her say that we'll never know who won the state. That's absurd. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=223.68s)]
*  It's ridiculous. And it's hard to know how to respond to that other than saying that some folks [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=230.48s)]
*  have been misled and to always try to lead with the truth. I think that's what really have had [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  years is lead with the truth in confronting some of that disinformation. And by the way, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=243.04s)]
*  we're not naive and neither are your viewers. Just leading with the truth and saying what the truth [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=247.28s)]
*  is isn't going to make the lies or the people who peddle them go away. Not everyone's going to do a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=252.16s)]
*  180, but they might do a 22. They might do a 37. They might do a 46. And over time that can have [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=257.2s)]
*  an effect. And Secretary Toulouse Oliver, your opponent is part of the America First SOS Coalition, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=263.76s)]
*  which is a national alliance of election denying secretary of state candidates that was created by [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=269.52s)]
*  the Trump endorsed candidate in Nevada, Jim Marchant. What do you make of that, that you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=275.52s)]
*  can actually have a coalition of election deniers running on tickets in very critical [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  positions? Because it's not just about what they do in this election. It's about if they do win [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=287.52s)]
*  what they will do in future elections. Well, it's absurd, but it's not only absurd. It's scary. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=292.0s)]
*  I think, you know, fortunately, our races are looking pretty good in many of these states with [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=299.36s)]
*  a lot of these election deniers on the ballot, but it's a very real possibility that we will see [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=304.56s)]
*  one or some of these folks elected. And what that means is that there will be people serving [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=310.56s)]
*  an office who are supposed to be the fair and nonpartisan, non impartial arbiters of our election [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=316.88s)]
*  process who are going to be in that office for the purpose of throwing an election and subverting the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=322.8s)]
*  will of the people. So this is very concerning. And folks in all of our states that have these [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  America First or any election denier candidate need to get out and vote and vote as if their [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=335.76s)]
*  vote depends on it because it is the very real fact of the matter. Secretary Weber, from just a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=341.52s)]
*  purely technical perspective, you run elections in the most populous state in our union. How are you [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=347.2s)]
*  reassuring voters that this election will be free and fair? What is keeping you up at night? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=354.56s)]
*  Well, you know, we worry about all the things that everyone else worries about, because even [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=360.96s)]
*  though we are a really strong democratic state and we don't have the deniers running for office [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=364.72s)]
*  in great numbers and probably will have none of them to win and come Tuesday because of California's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  strong position on voting rights. But we also know that there are ways in which you can frustrate [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=377.68s)]
*  voters. You can intimidate them. You can keep them from coming to the polls by doing various things [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  at the polls itself. And so we have gotten together with our attorney general, with the FBI, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  and with everyone else. And we've said to people very honestly that we're protecting our workers. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=396.08s)]
*  We're protecting those who come to vote. We won't tolerate anything happening to any individual and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=400.32s)]
*  that they are safe in coming into our polls. And so we have made written legislation to protect them [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=405.68s)]
*  because we know that if we give just an inch of something with regards to that, that opens up [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=412.48s)]
*  the flood gate for other things to happen. California should be the example of how we are [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=417.44s)]
*  going to, how people are going to be treated when they come to vote and how we're going to honor [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=422.08s)]
*  every vote that's there. We've been very, very fair with the Democrats and Republicans in terms [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=426.8s)]
*  of those getting on the ballot. I rule sometimes against folks that I know quite well, the governor [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=431.84s)]
*  and others, to make sure that they follow all the rules and regulations. So we're very transparent [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=437.28s)]
*  about what we do, but we won't tolerate any of the things that are happening across the nation. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=442.32s)]
*  And we have been flooded with lawsuits. I mean, we are, our attorney general, as well as my [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  attorneys in my office, have been flooded with lawsuits, frivolous lawsuits. None of them [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  basically proven to be true, just consuming our time and energy and frustrating people in the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=458.79999999999995s)]
*  process. But we continue to fight and we believe that we have to fight and California has the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=463.44s)]
*  resources and has the position to be able to fight and to support our friends and colleagues [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  in the other states. Secretary Griswold, what is your advice to voters if they're being [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=473.28s)]
*  intimidated at the polls? What should folks be doing if they see what is happening, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=478.32s)]
*  you know, as allegations have been made in Arizona happening in your state? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, first off, we have a zero tolerance policy for any type of intimidation. So no Colorado, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  no American should feel intimidated in casting their ballot. Here in Colorado, it's against [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=495.76s)]
*  state law. It's also against federal law. If you have any concerns, contact the DOJ, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=500.88s)]
*  contact local law enforcement, your secretary of state. But more than just that, we cannot allow [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=505.92s)]
*  threats of intimidation, fear to chill the vote. That is part of the attack on democracy itself. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=512.88s)]
*  It's the vitriol. And on top of some of the reports we're seeing at the polls, the use of threats [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=520.08s)]
*  and scare tactics have been turned towards election workers also. And that's why, Aiman, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=526.08s)]
*  this year I led a series of new laws in the state of Colorado. It's now a crime to doxer [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=532.32s)]
*  retaliate an election worker. We made it a felony to compromise voting equipment. We made it a crime [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=536.96s)]
*  to open carry close to a drop box or voting center or where they process votes to make sure our state [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=542.72s)]
*  laws are tight and to make sure that every eligible voter, regardless of the color of their skin, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  their zip code or the amount of money in their bank account has access to the franchise. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=553.2s)]
*  All right, secretaries, please stick around. We've got a lot more to discuss. After the break, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=557.2s)]
*  we are going to discuss the very [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIIEtygFtI&t=561.44s)]
