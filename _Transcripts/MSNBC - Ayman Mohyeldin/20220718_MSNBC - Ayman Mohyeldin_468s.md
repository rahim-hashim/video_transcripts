# Saudi Arabia Embassy Spokesperson Says Biden’s Visit Was Good For The Region
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0)
*  AMNA NAWAZAN, Former U.S. President, Biden's First Presidential Trip to the Middle East, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden has little to show for his troubles. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=7.44s)]
*  President Biden received zero concrete commitments from Saudi Arabia on oil production, and he [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=10.64s)]
*  made no significant progress toward an Israeli-Palestinian solution. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  I spoke about this and more earlier with the spokesperson for the Embassy of Saudi Arabia [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=18.72s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., Fahad Nader. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=22.96s)]
*  Fahad Nader, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  I know it has been a busy couple of days for you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=29.4s)]
*  I'd like to start first with the meeting, the images that we saw, and then we can talk [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=31.64s)]
*  about the substance of what came out. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=36.0s)]
*  President Biden on Friday met with the crown prince. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=39.12s)]
*  He said he spoke about the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=41.9s)]
*  What can you tell us about how that meeting went? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=45.7s)]
*  And did the crown prince push back on the president when he raised Khashoggi's murder? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=48.12s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me say that the decision by President Biden to visit Saudi Arabia on [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=54.12s)]
*  his first trip to the region is a testament to the strength and the importance of the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=61.04s)]
*  relationship. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=65.92s)]
*  This is a longstanding relationship that has served the national security interests of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=66.92s)]
*  both countries. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=71.24s)]
*  But I also think that it's been good for the region and the international community more [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=72.24s)]
*  broadly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=77.52s)]
*  Now, obviously, I think that the meeting went very well. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=78.52s)]
*  It was very cordial. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  It discussed a lot of issues of common concern and common interest. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  And the issue of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi did come up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=87.56s)]
*  As you know, we have been saying now for the past three years that the murder of Mr. Khashoggi [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=91.76s)]
*  was a heinous crime. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=96.16s)]
*  He was an affront to both our laws as well as our values. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=97.8s)]
*  The people who were behind it were arrested, prosecuted, and were held accountable. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=102.32s)]
*  We also took concrete measures to make sure that something like this never happens again. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=107.42s)]
*  And if you look at our 90-year history, you will find that this is simply not how we do [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=112.04s)]
*  things. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  It's not who we are. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  A lot has been made, sir, about what the U.S. was trying to get out of this trip, whether [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  it's oil prices or various bilateral cooperation agreements. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  I want to know what the Saudi government wanted from President Biden's trip. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=129.72s)]
*  What does the Saudi government want from the U.S.? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=133.76s)]
*  And did you get it with this visit? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=136.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=139.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=141.0s)]
*  So anytime the president visits Saudi Arabia, I mean, we consider that to be a success. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=142.0s)]
*  And as I said, I think that's a testament to the durability and the strength of the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  relationship. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=151.52s)]
*  The relationship in many ways is multidimensional. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=153.52s)]
*  It has a political component. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=156.28s)]
*  It has a military component. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  It has an economic component. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=159.28s)]
*  All of these issues were discussed during the meeting. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=161.28s)]
*  But not only that, I think the meeting, the visit, in some ways has set the stage for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=163.78s)]
*  the next 80 years of relations. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=169.0s)]
*  So there's a number of challenges that we both in the United States as well as Saudi [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=171.12s)]
*  Arabia, but also the broader international community face. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=175.4s)]
*  I'm talking about climate change, cybersecurity, food security. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=178.72s)]
*  And all of these elements were also discussed and kind of set the stage for the for the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=182.52s)]
*  next 80 years, including by concluding, I believe, 18 different agreements that will [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=187.12s)]
*  reinforce cooperation in terms of, again, cybersecurity, energy, food security, as [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=192.68s)]
*  well as the health care in terms of preventing future pandemics. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=199.52s)]
*  I'm sure you saw before President Biden left for his trip, he wrote in The Washington Post [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=205.36s)]
*  that his aim was to reorient but not rupture relations with Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=211.28s)]
*  Do you think this trip has done that? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=218.16s)]
*  Did you agree with that assessment that this was not about repurposing the trip but reorienting [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=220.4s)]
*  the relationship? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=226.72s)]
*  I mean, if you read the joint communique that was issued yesterday after the bilateral meetings [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=227.72s)]
*  that President Biden had with both the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Salman, as well [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=235.32s)]
*  as His Royal Highness, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, you will see that the areas of agreements, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=240.5s)]
*  the common interests, the common concerns that we have is as a long list. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=245.68s)]
*  And we, to a great extent, our concerns, our policies broadly align on a number of issues. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=251.0s)]
*  We're both committed to finding resolutions to some of the political crises across the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  region, primarily Yemen. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=262.2s)]
*  And I think we're very working very closely there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=264.36s)]
*  And I think we're a little bit closer today than we were a few months ago to resolving [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=266.86s)]
*  that conflict over the years. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=271.36s)]
*  We're also continuing to have a conversation about the importance of maintaining stable [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=273.04s)]
*  international energy markets. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=284.16s)]
*  So all of these issues were on the table. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=285.68s)]
*  All of them were discussed and reinforced. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=288.0s)]
*  And so I think we're happy with that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=290.6s)]
*  You bring up the subject of Yemen. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=293.56s)]
*  And this trip resulted in an agreement by the Saudis to commit to extending and strengthening [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  the U.N. mediated ceasefire. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=300.62s)]
*  What does that exactly mean? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=303.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the people of Yemen, we can all agree, are still suffering even under this ceasefire. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=304.62s)]
*  There's been a blockade on the country of Yemen. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=309.86s)]
*  I know that Saudi Arabia has been attacked by missiles coming out of Yemen. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  Did the U.S. get a commitment from the Saudis about lifting the blockade and getting food [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=315.74s)]
*  aid into Yemen? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=322.02000000000004s)]
*  And did you get something in exchange from the Americans about your security concerns [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  from Yemen? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=326.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=328.94s)]
*  So there is no blockade. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=329.94s)]
*  In fact, Saudi Arabia is the biggest provider of humanitarian aid to Yemen going back over [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=330.94s)]
*  the course of this crisis. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=337.98s)]
*  We have provided $19 billion of humanitarian assistance. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=339.62s)]
*  This has come in the form of food, medicine, assistance to internally displaced people, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=343.66s)]
*  assistance to the central bank. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=348.22s)]
*  We are beginning to build hospitals, schools. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, I'm not sure how this blockade story or narrative has spread, but it's certainly [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=353.26000000000005s)]
*  not the case. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=361.02000000000004s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, in fact, is doing everything it can to restore peace and stability to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=362.02000000000004s)]
*  Yemen. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=366.18s)]
*  And we are working very closely, not just with the United Nations. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=367.18s)]
*  We're working very closely with the United States as well. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=370.02000000000004s)]
*  We have been doing this for a number of years. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=372.66s)]
*  And I think we are closer now than we were three months ago because we do have this ongoing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=374.86s)]
*  truce. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=379.06s)]
*  There is also a leadership change. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=380.06s)]
*  You have this leadership council now that is representative of various segments and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=382.58s)]
*  regions of Yemen. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=387.78s)]
*  And we believe these are important steps forward in the right direction. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  And what about your security concerns coming out of Yemen? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=394.86s)]
*  Obviously, Saudi Arabia has been hit in the past. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you have any assurances from the U.S. that it is going to provide for you defensive capabilities? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=400.02s)]
*  Is it going to sell you offensive capabilities? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=406.29999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=410.86s)]
*  So again, if you read the communique, if you listen to President Biden's speech today, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=411.86s)]
*  that Jadid made his commitment to the security of Saudi Arabia and the broader region very [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=416.02000000000004s)]
*  clear, obviously, a military and security component of this relationship has been a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=421.58000000000004s)]
*  pillar of the relationship for going back decades. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=426.38000000000005s)]
*  We will continue to talk with our U.S. partners. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=429.5s)]
*  I mean, we have no higher priority in Saudi Arabia than protecting the safety of our people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  and of our territory. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=437.90000000000003s)]
*  And we will do whatever it takes to make sure that that's possible. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObbcSlvQOP0&t=438.9s)]
