Video Description: In his farewell address to the nation, President Biden warned of a growing oligarchy and the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. He also cited Eisenhower by warning of a “tech-industrial complex" and laid out a powerful agenda to combat these problems. But why now, as his term in office ends? MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin asks Faiz Shakir, who ran Bernie Sanders’ 2020 Presidential campaign, co-founded “More Perfect Union,” and is now running for DNC chair.

# Biden channels Bernie Sanders in farewell address warning about oligarchy
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI)
*  After a half-century in politics, Joe Biden delivered his farewell address to the nation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=0.0s)]
*  on Wednesday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=4.72s)]
*  His warnings about the oligarchy and extreme concentrations of wealth and power were striking. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=5.72s)]
*  And his remarks on the threat of the tech-industrial complex drew immediate comparisons to President [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=11.24s)]
*  Eisenhower's famous military-industrial complex warning in his own farewell address back in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=17.36s)]
*  1961. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=22.44s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=23.44s)]
*  An oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=25.44s)]
*  threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=30.8s)]
*  to get ahead. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, Biden also laid out a powerful agenda, which included changing the tax code to ensure [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  billionaires pay their fair share, eliminating the flow of head and sources of money into [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=44.16s)]
*  political campaigns, banning members of Congress from trading stocks and establishing 18-year [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=49.12s)]
*  term limits for members of the Supreme Court. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=54.8s)]
*  Those are all great ideas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=57.28s)]
*  But I have a question. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=60.76s)]
*  Where was this Joe Biden four years ago? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  And I'm not the only one who was thinking it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=65.52s)]
*  Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse posted, now, he tells us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=68.24s)]
*  President Biden speaks out against dark money for climate action and for SCOTUS term limits. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=72.52s)]
*  I pressed four years for this speech. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=76.68s)]
*  He added, that was a great speech. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  Had that speech launched the reelection campaign, we would have won. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=82.28s)]
*  Had that speech launched his presidency, we would have saved America. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=86.2s)]
*  Now, we fight on. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  He may be right, and it raises the question, why make this address now? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=93.0s)]
*  I mean, was it political malpractice to save his best material, his most progressive positions [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  yet for his goodbye address? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=102.18s)]
*  Are these warnings also new to Biden, brought on only by the billionaires and tech tycoons [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=105.08s)]
*  circling Mar-a-Lago and Trump's White House and getting ready to take the country over? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=109.98s)]
*  Or was it impossible to talk about the oligarchy and the tech-industrial complex early in his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=115.44s)]
*  presidency because of all the power they also have over the Democratic Party as well? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=120.72s)]
*  These are questions that Democrats and other political watchers are left to examine as [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=126.78s)]
*  we say goodbye to Joe and say hello to Trump 2.0. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=131.88s)]
*  Kicking us off this hour is the man who ran Bernie Sanders' campaign in 2020, Fayez Shekhar. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=136.88s)]
*  He's also the founder of More Perfect Union and now a candidate for DNC chair. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Fayez, it's great to have you back on the show. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=147.24s)]
*  When I hear President Biden railing against the oligarchy, which I completely agree with, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  the dangerous concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few, I actually [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=155.66s)]
*  thought I was listening to Bernie Sanders here for a moment, to a Bernie Sanders speech. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=161.26s)]
*  It resonates like that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  Why is Joe Biden putting this message out now? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=166.06s)]
*  And as Senator Whitehouse pointed out, was it a mistake to not run his White House with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=168.7s)]
*  this message in full force? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=175.42s)]
*  Well, reality has a well-known progressive populist bias here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=179.5s)]
*  We are obviously living in the midst of great income and wealth inequality and we're slowly [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=184.54s)]
*  slipping into an abyss where it's slapping everyone across the face and you can't ignore [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=189.82s)]
*  it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=193.78s)]
*  Obviously, Bernie Sanders ran in 2015, 2016, calling on exactly this problem and wanting [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=194.78s)]
*  us to address it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  The sad part for me, I mean, is that there are actually a lot of instances in which you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=201.14s)]
*  saw this Biden administration taking uniquely bold action against Amazon. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=205.1s)]
*  When you think of why Zuckerberg, quite frankly, is upset with the Biden administration because [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=209.94s)]
*  they launched a lawsuit against him to break up the monopoly of Facebook. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=215.02s)]
*  Now, I ask you, how many people know that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=217.82s)]
*  When you look at Elon Musk, he's very angry at Joe Biden. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=221.5s)]
*  Do you know why? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=224.26s)]
*  Because he didn't get opportunities to go and sit down and talk to him because Biden [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=225.26s)]
*  thought he was a union buster. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=228.7s)]
*  Now, how many people know that? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=230.3s)]
*  What was the big gap, sadly, during this period of time where you had a lot of actions from [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=232.54s)]
*  I think we're taking on corporate power. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  You think big pharma with Medicare price negotiation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=241.02s)]
*  You think the Federal Trade Commission, the crypto world was very angry at Gary Gensler. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=243.3s)]
*  And yet very few people knew about that because the political apparatus was not out there [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=247.46s)]
*  in conflict alongside Joe Biden as his administration was taking on corporate power. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=253.06s)]
*  So is it even possible for Democrats to run against the oligarchy? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=259.86s)]
*  There are oligarchs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=264.94s)]
*  There are billionaires that support the Democratic Party. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=266.1s)]
*  You've got many voters likely to perceive and are right to perceive that the concentration [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=269.26s)]
*  of wealth and power as a problem for both political parties, perhaps it just manifests [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  its way differently, maybe more overtly. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=279.74s)]
*  There's not a Democratic Elon Musk running out around and jumping up and down on the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=282.18s)]
*  stage with Kamala Harris or Joe Biden. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=286.14s)]
*  But how do you know? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=288.9s)]
*  We had Mark Cuban, if you remember. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=289.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=291.62s)]
*  You do have Mark Cuban. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=293.14s)]
*  How do Democrats run against the oligarchy when on the elite level they are part of it [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=295.14s)]
*  themselves? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=298.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=299.74s)]
*  And I think that in this moment, it's important as a Democrat myself and a believer in the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=300.74s)]
*  brand, it needs much repair. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=306.18s)]
*  It's tarnished. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=309.94s)]
*  It's failing with a lot of people because they hold us, quite frankly, to a higher standard [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=310.94s)]
*  than they do the Republicans. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=315.34s)]
*  Republicans are the alt option. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=317.02s)]
*  And they hold us to that higher bar because they feel in moments of great wealth and income [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=319.34s)]
*  inequality, the Democratic Party for a long period of time has been the fighter for the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=323.98s)]
*  common man and woman. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=328.86s)]
*  Its lineage of FDR and JFK and LBJ and those periods of bringing forth great social safety [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=330.18s)]
*  nets and fighting against corporate monopolists, that was our long tradition in history. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=337.58000000000004s)]
*  And the economic justice primacy of this current iteration of the Democratic Party has been [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=343.5s)]
*  lost a bit. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=349.86s)]
*  It is not the first things or first two things you'll hear out of the mouth of too many Democrats. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=350.86s)]
*  And we've got to change that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  That's how you rebuild as a working class party again. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=356.78000000000003s)]
*  You've got to think of putting that economic justice primacy up top, building a grassroots [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  party, really like associating us with fights all around the country when we are taking [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=366.06s)]
*  on wealth and income inequality, like you're fighting housing evictions from greedy landlords [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=370.86s)]
*  or you're fighting utility rate hikes from big utility companies. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=375.18s)]
*  Whatever the case might be, we associate ourselves with those fights. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=379.1s)]
*  When workers go on strike or when they organize at big plants, we should associate ourselves [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=382.14000000000004s)]
*  with those. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  But too much, we've been sitting on the sidelines and that's got to change. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=386.78000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you a question about your old boss, if you don't mind, Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=389.92s)]
*  The day after the election, Senator Sanders made this bold statement. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=392.98s)]
*  He said it should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=396.3s)]
*  working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them while the Democratic [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=400.94s)]
*  leadership defends the status quo. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=406.98s)]
*  The American people are angry and want change and they are right. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=409.1s)]
*  And yet, Senator Sanders is also fond of repeating the same phrase about President Biden. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=413.54s)]
*  Here's what he told my colleague, Kristen Welker, right after the election as well. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  President Biden, when he came into office, said that he would be the most progressive [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=424.06s)]
*  president since FDR. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=428.26s)]
*  And I think on domestic issues, not foreign policy, on domestic issues, he has kept his [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  word and the agenda that he has pushed through has been an extraordinarily strong one. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  How do you square those two statements? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=441.0s)]
*  On one hand, the Democrats have abandoned the working class. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  On the other hand, Joe Biden was the most progressive president since FDR. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=446.16s)]
*  When you look at abandoning working class, he's very upset about how Kamala Harris and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  the team ran that presidential campaign. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  When Boeing workers were on strike during the course of the Kamala Harris campaign, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=457.6s)]
*  you didn't hear us talk about that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=461.76s)]
*  You didn't hear too many opportunities of going out and standing with the ports workers [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  when they were on strike during that campaign. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=466.64s)]
*  You didn't hear a ton of a bold agenda of raising the minimum wage, of what's the next [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=468.64s)]

*  How are we going to expand Medicare? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=476.8s)]
*  We pushed behind the scenes to finally get her talking about expanding it to home care, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=478.8s)]
*  which when she did, Bernie Sanders went out and talked about it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=482.64s)]
*  Of course, we had urged her to stand with him and talk about that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=486.64s)]
*  That didn't come together. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=490.16s)]
*  We were frustrated, quite frankly, that they referenced Liz Cheney and Mark Cuban as key [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  spokespersons, didn't feel like they were leaning into working class fights. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=497.44s)]
*  We made that argument behind the scenes a ton. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=501.44s)]
*  They made choices, and we didn't agree with those choices. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=503.44s)]
*  Now, that said, the Biden record was, in our views, the Biden record was something proud [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=507.44000000000005s)]
*  to run on and explain that while we were reducing prescription drug prices, particularly for [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=512.48s)]
*  seniors, let's say, we're capping it at $2,000. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  Because of the efforts that we did. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=521.36s)]
*  Now, let's expand it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=522.48s)]
*  What's the next iteration? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=523.52s)]
*  Or Medicare, we're improving upon. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=524.8s)]
*  Now, let's go to hearing, dental, and vision coverage. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=526.4s)]
*  He was pushing, what are the next iterations? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=530.16s)]
*  Let's build on a stock buyback tax that we've now introduced and we're past at 1%. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=532.16s)]
*  Let's raise it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=536.8s)]
*  Let's do more. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  Those were the things that were left on the table. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=538.88s)]
*  You didn't hear. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=540.48s)]
*  You don't remember price gouging, but you had a Biden administration doing actions on [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=541.28s)]
*  price gouging. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=546.16s)]
*  She mentioned that she would go after predatory price gouging, and then the flushing out of [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=547.04s)]
*  that actually got watered down over the course of the campaign. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=551.36s)]
*  It didn't get escalated. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  And so that's how I would explain the difference. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  It was a course of criticizing how we campaigned versus how we were governing, and the two just [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=557.28s)]
*  didn't match up. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you about you and your plans forward. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  You are running for the DNC chair. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=565.04s)]
*  What do you hope to accomplish and change if elected? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm glad that we have a lot of people talking about working class party, and I find [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=570.56s)]
*  that's the commonality. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=575.52s)]
*  That's the bridge. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=576.48s)]
*  We got to do it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=576.96s)]
*  So then I questioned, OK, well, what are we going to do about it? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=577.52s)]
*  Let's do something different and new. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=579.84s)]
*  And it has to start with building a grassroots party. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=581.28s)]
*  I mean, we have to open the doors, invite people in, find willingness to challenge our [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=583.6s)]
*  own brand and our weakness with them, with working class people. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=588.72s)]
*  And so in my view, you could use an apparatus of $100-plus million a year and 50 states [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  plus that I think, you know, if you open those doors, you have an opportunity to go do the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=597.76s)]
*  things that I've been criticizing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  You stand with striking workers. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=605.28s)]
*  That's a core organizing philosophy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=607.04s)]
*  You do digital media around some of these economic justice fights that are going around [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=608.88s)]
*  the country. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=612.8s)]
*  And God knows we'll have a lot of opportunities with Elon Musk and Donald Trump doing a hell [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=613.28s)]
*  of a lot of quid pro quo bidding that we'll have an opportunity to do content around. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=618.56s)]
*  But this is the big moment. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=622.8s)]
*  Do we open the doors? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=624.0s)]
*  Do we get out in communities and build a vibrant grassroots network that's about taking on [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=625.12s)]
*  the ruling class, the corruption and political elite of the ruling class? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=629.76s)]
*  That's what I want this Democratic Party to stand for. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=632.24s)]
*  I'm going to pitch the vision. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=634.48s)]
*  We'll see where it goes. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ucVOlTDZI&t=635.6800000000001s)]
