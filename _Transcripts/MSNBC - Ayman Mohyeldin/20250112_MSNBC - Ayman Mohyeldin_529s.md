# Zuckerberg's full transformation from tech bro to full MAGA
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY)
*  The US government should be defending its companies, right? Not be the tip of the spear [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=0.0s)]
*  attacking its companies. I don't want to come across as if, like, we don't have things that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=5.24s)]
*  we need to do better. Obviously, we do. And when we mess something up, we deserve to be [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=8.96s)]
*  held accountable for that and just like everyone else. I do think that the American technology [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=13.84s)]
*  industry is a bright spot in the American economy. I think it's a strategic advantage [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=20.16s)]
*  for the United States that we have a lot of the strongest companies in the world. And [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I think it should be part of the US's strategy going forward to defend that. And it's one [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=29.72s)]
*  of the things that I'm optimistic about with President Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=34.48s)]
*  So that was Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg arguing that when the US government targets or attacks [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=38.08s)]
*  tech companies, it sets a dangerous precedent. And it seems kind of rich coming from Mark [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=43.76s)]
*  Zuckerberg because you know it was Zuck that Donald Trump literally threatened to throw [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=50.0s)]
*  in prison for the rest of his life if he did anything illegal to influence the presidential [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=55.52s)]
*  election. And this week Trump even gloated that Zuckerberg rolled back his fact checking [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=60.52s)]
*  program because he scared him into it. And with that capitulation, Zuck seems to have [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=65.08s)]
*  completed his full transformation from tech bro to MAGA world. The transformation includes [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  bulking up, abandoning his hoodie for an oversized black tee and of course, a little bling around [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=76.48s)]
*  his neck. And to be honest, the signs have been there for a while. So it's not an overnight [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=81.92s)]
*  transformation. Back in 2023, the Meta CEO agreed to a hypothetical cage fight with fellow [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=87.0s)]
*  billionaire Elon Musk, which thankfully never actually happened. Zuckerberg has been trying [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=92.6s)]
*  to find his way to the ring for some time. After all, who could forget this awkward moment [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=98.6s)]
*  at a UFC fight last year where he seemed out of place walking in with a fighter's entourage [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=103.72s)]
*  and then not knowing what to do. No matter how much the Zuck tried, he just seemed out [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  of place. Until now, it seems, earlier this month Zuckerberg announced that UFC CEO Dana [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  White will join the board of directors at Meta. And I guess it kind of makes sense when [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  you think about it. White is a good person to have in Zuckerberg's corner. Not only did [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=126.6s)]
*  he speak during Trump's victory night speech, he has been friends with Donald Trump for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=131.04s)]
*  decades. Zuckerberg is probably hoping that he'll be one of the boys joining White, Trump [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=136.2s)]
*  and Elon Musk at those UFC fights. You know who else is in both the UFC and Trump orbit? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=141.83999999999997s)]
*  Joe Rogan. He has been a ringside commentator at UFC fights for years, and he just had [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  Zuckerberg on a new episode of his popular podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience that aired [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=154.28s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  We're also lucky that you got into jiu-jitsu. I think that had an effect on you. You look [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=159.92s)]
*  different when you walked in here today. You look thicker. You look like a different guy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  You do. You look like a jiu-jitsu guy now. It's funny. I saw your neck. I'm like, his [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  neck's bigger. Your neck is bigger. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=176.92s)]
*  Good. Yeah, big neck, thick, you know, plus Joe Rogan's blessing. What more does a man [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=179.72s)]
*  need to make it in MAGA world? Molly Dean and Angela are back with me. Angela, your [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=186.72s)]
*  take on this full transformation by Zuckerberg. I mean, we can joke around a little bit, but [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=194.28s)]
*  it carries some serious and dangerous weight for a lot in this country. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=200.48s)]
*  Yeah, it really does for a lot of reasons. I mean, this isn't surprising. He's done this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=205.48s)]
*  before. Let's not forget that back in 2016, you know, after Glenn Beck, Tucker Carlson, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=210.44s)]
*  Laura Ingraham did this meeting with him in May of 2016, he radically overhauled Facebook's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=216.2s)]
*  policies around the trending topics section and right-wing misinformation and content [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  exploded. There's been this idea, at least into that sort of metastasized, that somehow [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  Facebook has been suppressing or censoring conservative content. It's just the right-wing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  working the refs. I mean, we did a big study that looked at 29 million posts. Right-wing [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  content had 42% of the engagements, even though it only accounted for 19% of the content. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=238.04s)]
*  I mean, that's not what suppression and censorship looks like. But part of what we're seeing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=243.2s)]
*  is the culmination of a strategy of working the refs and doing two things. You threaten [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=248.32s)]
*  them and bully them. In this case, you know, Zuckerberg not only got threatened to be jailed, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=253.04s)]
*  but then in November, right after Trump won the election, the guy that's going to be the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=256.96s)]
*  new FCC chair sent a letter saying, hey, we're going to come after your Section 230 immunity [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  protections unless you stop censoring. So one was to avoid consequences. And then the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=265.4s)]
*  second part, which is even scarier, and this is going to be the new norm, is that you could also [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=270.28s)]
*  get something out of it. And that's what Zuckerberg saw, is that if you don't just say nice things to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  Trump, but you actually start to take what you have, which is his ecosystem, and use it to empower [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=277.88s)]
*  Naga and the megaphone that we were just talking about in the first segment, you can get something [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=283.32s)]
*  out of it. And what he wants is less accountability from other countries that are actually cracking [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  down on the types of misinformation, disinformation, extremism, sort of surveillance, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=291.55999999999995s)]
*  advertising that the platform is doing. And they're trying to rein it in. And what he wants is [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=296.72s)]
*  protection. So he wants to basically exploit the government to protect and further enrich himself. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=301.84s)]
*  And if he has to give up the platform, so be it. And to me, it's not just about fact checking. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=307.88s)]
*  The part that's scarier, that's what I'll stop, is that he said we're not only not going to fact [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=313.16s)]
*  check, but we're also going to open up the floodgates. What they had previously been doing was [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=316.88s)]
*  slowing down the types of content that would otherwise lead to misinformation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=321.16s)]
*  And now they're saying, hey, that's a free fall now. It's all going to get supercharged. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=326.28s)]
*  So we're in for trouble. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=329.2s)]
*  Yeah. So he's not just doing the fact checking thing and getting away with that part. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=330.84s)]
*  It's the fact that he's now echoing these talking points. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=336.28s)]
*  He has now fully adapted this narrative by MAGA that there's political bias, that tech companies [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  were somehow liberal or biased or liberal and Democrats. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  And now he's gone full tilt the other way to Angela's point that he's now really just [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=349.4s)]
*  parroting the talking points from the far right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=355.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's tech bros midlife crisis. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=356.96s)]
*  Right. He's just and I would say, look, he's doing this because he thinks Trump is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=359.56s)]
*  transactional and he can get a transaction from him. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=364.68s)]
*  The thing I find the most appalling about that clip is him being furious that the government [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=368.16s)]
*  wanted to regulate him at all. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=374.44s)]
*  Yeah. You know, he's like, I did all this for you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=376.36s)]
*  The man is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=379.2s)]
*  You'll forgive me if I do not feel sorry for him. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=382.08s)]
*  But I do think it is the set up here. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=384.84s)]
*  I mean, I know this is my hobby horse, but like Congress refused to regulate technology [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=386.88s)]
*  at all. They were like, just please, please, please do something. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  Tech bros were like, why? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  And also mad at the implication that they should regulate themselves at all. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=400.4s)]
*  And now they have a guy in office who does who's absolutely never going to let anyone [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=405.0s)]
*  have any regulation at all. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  And so I think it is a perfect storm. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  But again, the idea that these people would do this on their own, that these big companies [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  would regulate themselves for the betterment of public good was always a complete foul. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=418.24s)]
*  This idea that, you know, that they were being asked to censorship and this something that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=424.72s)]
*  you and I, you know, obviously track very closely. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  Palestinian voices on Facebook have been silenced and censored. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=431.68s)]
*  And yet here he is pretending to be that he's going to be an advocate for free speech [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=436.76s)]
*  without saying anything at all about whether or not these voices that, you know, have been [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=441.84s)]
*  well documented by a lot of watchdog groups and activists out there is not the case. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=446.24s)]
*  I could not agree with you more. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=451.36s)]
*  Does this mean now that Mark Zuckerberg's allowed on Instagram and Facebook, my friends, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=452.92s)]
*  to post images of their family who are under occupation in the West Bank or friends, family [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=457.28s)]
*  or people they've seen in the media being killed in Gaza? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=462.24s)]
*  Probably not. That's not what free speech is. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=465.36s)]
*  This idea that Donald Trump is a defender of free speech is insane. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=467.52000000000004s)]
*  It's the man who threatened CBS with their license, ABC with their license, sued Iowa [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=471.6s)]
*  Paper for pointing a poll in like a guy to remind everyone as president called on the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  FCC to investigate Senate Live and cancel it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=481.04s)]
*  And he called publicly to cancel Senate Live, which is shot in this building, for mocking [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=484.0s)]
*  him. This man is a threat to any speech. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't like Donald Trump. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=490.04s)]
*  So for Zuckerberg. But isn't there a beautiful moment, Zuckerberg and Rogan falling in love? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=491.32s)]
*  Look at your neck. It's so beautiful. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  Like, oh, I wish you spoke to me like that after all. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=497.04s)]
*  I love your hair, though, if that counts. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=502.72s)]
*  Your neck's bigger than ever. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALf9hl8QqfY&t=507.52000000000004s)]
