Video Description: As poll after poll shows Kamala Harris ahead of Donald Trump nationally, Republicans are getting ready to build a pathway to challenge a potential Harris victory. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin lays out how Georgia's Republican-controlled state election board approved a new rule that could throw the vote count into chaos this fall - and how the threat to democracy is not exclusive to Georgia.

# The GOP's plan to challenge a Harris victory
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY)
*  Republicans are in a full state of panic. With each passing day, poll after poll shows Vice [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=0.0s)]
*  President Kamala Harris ahead of Trump nationally, 49 percent to his 46 percent. Harris managing to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  lead Trump in swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin while narrowing his lead in Georgia. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=11.52s)]
*  And we know what Trump leans on when faced with that polling. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=16.8s)]
*  Our primary focus is not to get out the vote. It's to make sure they don't cheat, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=23.04s)]
*  because we have all the votes you need. They are going to cheat like hell to win the election. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=27.36s)]
*  The Republicans, however, are listening and building a pathway to challenge a potential [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=34.96s)]
*  Harris victory. In Georgia, the GOP-controlled state election board approved a new rule [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=39.68s)]
*  that could throw the state's vote count into chaos this fall, providing an additional avenue [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=44.64s)]
*  for election officials to delay certification of results should they choose to. As ProPublica [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=49.6s)]
*  reports, the rule was secretly pushed by the board, which consists of pro-Trump election deniers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=55.2s)]
*  And before the board approved it last week, nationally prominent conservative activists [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=60.88s)]
*  reportedly spoke in support of the rule, including a representative from, you guessed it, the Heritage [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=65.68s)]
*  Foundation. Now, this threat to democracy is not exclusive to Georgia. Over in Wisconsin, a Texas-based [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=72.0s)]
*  group called True the Vote is teaming up with sympathetic sheriffs to monitor polling locations [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=78.08s)]
*  and drop boxes. The group is known for peddling false claims of voter fraud in 2020. The group's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=83.84s)]
*  co-founder says the program is, quote, mainly focused in Wisconsin, but we do have a scalable [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  program. Trump is also getting help from a key ally, Matt Schlapp, head of the American [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=95.04s)]
*  Conservative Union Group and organizer of the annual CPAC conference. Last week, Schlapp sent [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  a letter to officials in at least three states, Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, laying out plans [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=105.04s)]
*  to monitor ballot drop boxes. In the letter obtained by the Washington Post, Schlapp warns [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=110.32s)]
*  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Attorney General Chris Carr that, quote, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  failure to do so risks that the results of the November elections will be questioned by those [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  who did not support the winning candidate. In case it is not obvious, Republicans are parting [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  like it's 2020. Trump's efforts to overturn the election thankfully failed back then, despite all [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  his efforts, including that infamous phone call for Georgia's Secretary of State to find the votes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=137.12s)]
*  Let's not forget the attempted coup on our Capitol. Since then, Trump's election denialism has only [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=143.84s)]
*  ramped up. He spent his time out of office primming his supporters for a loss in November. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=149.04s)]
*  And don't forget key figures that saved democracy the last time around. They're now gone, like Mike [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=155.6s)]
*  Pence. Trump's allies are no doubt watching and ready to act. Listen to how Trump praised members [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  of Georgia's election board earlier this month. The Georgia state election board is in a very [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=166.96s)]
*  positive way. This is a very positive thing, Marjorie. They're doing a great job. Three members, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  Janice Johnson, Rick Jeffries, and Janelle King, three people, are all pit bulls fighting for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=180.4s)]
*  honesty, transparency, and victory. They're fighting. Joining me now, Anna Bauer, Fulton County [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  correspondent at Lawfare, and Dave Ehrenberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County, Florida. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=194.88s)]
*  It's great to have both of you with us. Anna, talk to us about this Georgia election board. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  It really went under the radar nationally. Now it's full blown. People are seeing it's too little, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  too late now to do anything about it. But Trump, as we just saw in that clip, referred to the board [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=208.72s)]
*  members as his, quote, pit bulls. What do we know about them and how far they are willing to go for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=212.88s)]
*  him, so to speak, now that he's nationalized them and platformed them by calling them out, as we just [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  saw in that clip? Right. So the state election board is an administrative body of unelected [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=224.64s)]
*  officials. They are able to set rules for elections within the state. However, they are somewhat [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  limited in their ability to set those rules in that they have to be consistent with Georgia's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  statutes and what has been passed by the General Assembly, as well as Georgia case law. But we've [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  recently had an interesting change within the state election board. It used to be controlled [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=250.88s)]
*  by a mix of a Democrat and then some more moderate Republicans, people who have policy positions [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=256.4s)]
*  around elections that are more akin to Brad Raffensperger, the Secretary of State of Georgia, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=264.08s)]
*  who famously was on the phone call and the subject of many of Trump's attacks in 2020. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=269.92s)]
*  But recently in the spring, there were changes to that board so that we now have three Trump-backed [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  and Trump-praised, as you saw at that rally, election board members who have taken steps [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=282.8s)]
*  in recent weeks to change some of these election rules in ways that are consistent with policy [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=289.04s)]
*  positions that Trump and MAGA affiliates have wanted to move in terms of their so-called [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  election integrity efforts. Dave, walk us through the chaos that something like this could create [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=302.48s)]
*  for the election if Vice President Harris does win in Georgia and then they push to delay [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=308.48s)]
*  certifying the vote. What does that sense of chaos do to the outcome? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Eamon, that's really what they could do. It's chaos. It's a gum up the works. They're trying [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=320.88s)]
*  to delay things into so doubts in the minds of Georgians and Americans that there is somehow [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=325.44s)]
*  some ballot fraud. They're hoping eventually to cause Congress to jump in and to try to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=331.36s)]
*  overturn the election. This is their plan. And the way we know this is that, as you and Anna pointed [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=336.64s)]
*  out, you saw that rally and Trump called out the three members of the board who were on his side. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=343.2s)]
*  One of them was there at the rally taking a bow, living it up. I mean, that doesn't sound like [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=351.2s)]
*  nonpartisan, fair, objective election officials to me. So their whole intent is to help Donald [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=356.72s)]
*  Trump. Now, the good news is, is that the final say really is up to the governor and the secretary [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=364.0s)]
*  of state, Brad Raftesberger. They have proven based on the last election that they have no [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=369.36s)]
*  tolerance for Republican election shenanigans. But these local officials now are empowered to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=375.04s)]
*  delay matters. And that could throw a wrench in the plans to get the certification in on time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=380.72s)]
*  You know, and according to the Washington Post, the Georgia election board has signaled, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=387.92s)]
*  as I understand it, plans to adopt nearly a dozen additional rules in coming weeks, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=392.88000000000005s)]
*  despite the warnings from state and local officials that the lateness of the calendar in which they're [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=398.24s)]
*  trying to do all of this, all but guarantees confusion and mistakes. It is the point in all [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  of this, right, is to create and sow this confusion part of the MAGA strategy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  I do think that that is part of the strategy here. I will point out that some of the recent [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=420.4s)]
*  rule changes, for example, use incredibly vague or ambiguous terms. They create confusion and that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=425.76s)]
*  they seem to be inconsistent with Georgia statutes. They seem to invite litigation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=433.44s)]
*  I think that it's likely that we could see some litigation around the recent rule changes related [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=439.36s)]
*  to certification, as well as the rule changes that relate to the tabulation of votes. One of the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=444.4s)]
*  more concerning rule changes that we've recently seen is a rule change in which it is [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=451.6s)]
*  stated in this rule that if a local elections board finds fraud in an investigation of the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=458.56s)]
*  precinct returns, then they must find a just method of tabulating those votes. People and sources [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=470.64s)]
*  that I've talked to close to the matter in the past week have indicated that proponents of this [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=478.88s)]
*  rule think that that gives local election officials the ability to potentially disregard votes [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=486.48s)]
*  if they believe that there has been fraud within the precinct returns. That is very concerning [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=493.12s)]
*  because it's not just a delay of certification that Dave was talking about, but it is fully [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=499.92s)]
*  disregarding and changing tabulation of the votes, which is not at all consistent with what Georgia [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=505.76s)]
*  courts have said is the duty of local officials when they are certifying the election results. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=511.68s)]
*  They have a very limited discretion to just look at mathematical errors to tabulate the votes. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  They don't have the ability to make qualitative decisions about whether or not there has been [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=524.64s)]
*  election fraud. That is for the courts to decide. Dave, let's talk about the group True the Vote, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=529.44s)]
*  and it seems like they're teaming up with sheriffs in swing states, as we mentioned, like Wisconsin [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=535.52s)]
*  and elsewhere, to monitor polling locations and drop boxes. From a legal point of view, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=541.04s)]
*  where is the line when it comes to voter intimidation? It's one thing to monitor [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=548.16s)]
*  elections generally. We have a pretty robust system in which candidates and their parties [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=552.8s)]
*  are allowed to do that. It's another thing to shop around for sympathetic organizations to be [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  outside on the streets seeing people as they cast their ballots. Yeah, it's going to take strong [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=563.52s)]
*  leadership from local and state election officials to avoid the shenanigans by True the Vote. See, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=570.96s)]
*  True the Vote is a Texas-based group, and they have tried to cast out about elections in various [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=577.36s)]
*  states. They tried to do so in Georgia in the last election. In fact, they filed suit against [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=583.44s)]
*  Brad Rapsburg. They said they had affidavits and evidence that there was fraud, and then a judge [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=588.16s)]
*  did something amazing. The judge compelled True the Vote to turn over the evidence, and guess what, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=593.6s)]
*  they had nothing. They were lies. They were a bunch of phonies. And when it comes down to it, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=599.04s)]
*  they're just a hollow shell themselves. They just have a lot of show and no go. But they can do [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=605.92s)]
*  damage if they have a sympathetic election official on their side. That's why it's important [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=611.92s)]
*  who the secretaries of states are in swing states and the governors. Fortunately, it looks like, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=616.88s)]
*  at least in the swing states, the secretaries of states, election officials at the top level who [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=622.32s)]
*  actually have power, are there to protect elections rather than prevent people from voting. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=626.8s)]
*  Amanda, the reason Trump failed to overturn the election in 2020 was obviously because [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  we had proper guardrails to block him, perhaps even Mike Pence having that moment of clarity [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=637.92s)]
*  and sanity to not overturn the election. You had at the DNC election officials assessing the threat [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=643.3599999999999s)]
*  at an event hosted by the Brennan Center, and actually their greatest worry, according to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=649.04s)]
*  The Washington Post, was, quote, the possibility of civil unrest. Even if efforts to subvert [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=653.28s)]
*  election results fail, an army of angry Trump supporters could resort to violence just as they [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbvVPEm52VY&t=659.04s)]
