# How Jack Smith's indictment has vindicated work of Jan. 6th Select Committee
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0)
*  The counsel Jack Smith's criminal indictment appeared to be more than two and a half years [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=0.0s)]
*  in the making, but the American public heard many of the key details of this case outlined [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  in a series of hearings last year, as well as in an 800 page report run by the January [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=12.1s)]
*  6th select committee. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=18.16s)]
*  As striking as it is, the four count indictment handed up by the grand jury, hews closely [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=19.92s)]
*  to the roadmap outlined by the select committee in its final report. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=25.38s)]
*  In fact, three of the four counts included in the special counsel's indictment mirror [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=29.28s)]
*  charges that were recommended by the panel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=33.44s)]
*  The committee also specifically recommended prosecution of Trump himself and one of the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=36.52s)]
*  ex-presidents, now unindicted co-conspirators, attorney John Eastman, who still could face [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  legal peril as the special counsel probe continues. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=47.42s)]
*  Of course, the Justice Department could advance their investigation beyond what Congress had [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  been able to accomplish, but still this shows the two investigations, which each had different [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  goals and tools, could collect evidence around Trump's post-election efforts and land roughly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  at the same conclusions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=66.58s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the select committee, said this about the indictment, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=69.2s)]
*  many of the crucial facts that surfaced during the January 6th investigation reappear in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=72.84s)]
*  this indictment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  We told this story in time for these events not to be buried in ideology and deceit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=79.32s)]
*  It feels to me like a powerful vindication of the rule of law in America. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=84.88s)]
*  Joining me now is Tim Hafe, former lead investigator for the January 6th select committee. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=90.08s)]
*  Tim, it's great to see you again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=95.24s)]
*  We've been speaking quite frequently, you and I, but I wanted to get your reaction to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  what has been happening between Trump, Jack Smith, and Judge Tanya Chutkin, who denied [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  the Trump request for an extension to respond to the Justice Department's motion for a protective [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=106.3s)]
*  order. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=111.64s)]
*  And this morning Trump attacked a judge saying he wanted her recused from the case. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=112.64s)]
*  The protective order was requested after he threatened, you know, I guess generally made [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=117.4s)]
*  a threat against those that may be involved in the case on social media. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=122.94s)]
*  And this kind of intimidation is common for Trump. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=126.64s)]
*  We saw him make similar attacks on people who testified before your committee, including [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=129.52s)]
*  Cassidy Hutchinson and others. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=133.7s)]
*  Do you believe a protective order against Trump is necessary as this case proceeds? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=135.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'll leave that to Judge Chutkin. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=139.96s)]
*  She's very capable. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  I will say that what we found repeatedly over the course of our investigation are that the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  president's, the former president's tweets are not taken rhetorically by people in America, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=149.8s)]
*  but are taken literally. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=155.24s)]
*  We talked to dozens of people that came to Washington and ultimately ended up at the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=156.9s)]
*  Capitol because of his specific invitation, because of his words. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=162.4s)]
*  And as he personally identified Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss, the two election workers in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=169.52s)]
*  Georgia, Al Schmidt, the election official in Philadelphia, they received direct threats. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=175.04s)]
*  So what the president says, this is classic political speech. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=182.56s)]
*  It actually has real life consequences in terms of the safety of people who are either [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=186.96s)]
*  directly or implicitly referenced. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=192.24s)]
*  So it's very dangerous. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=194.04s)]
*  Judge Chutkin is going to want to hear a reasonable explanation from the Trump team before she [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=195.12s)]
*  rules. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=200.56s)]
*  Let me play for you, committee member Zoe Lofgren, speaking during a hearing with Ben [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=201.56s)]
*  Ginsburg, a lawyer who has represented Republicans in national elections. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=205.98s)]
*  So are you aware of any instance in which a court found that Trump campaign's fraud [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  claims to be credible? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  No, there was never that instance. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=219.56s)]
*  In all the cases that were brought, and I've looked at the more than 60 that include more [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=223.52s)]
*  than 180 counts. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=228.56s)]
*  And no, the simple fact is that the Trump campaign did not make its case. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=230.8s)]
*  Do you feel your work has been vindicated by this indictment? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=236.68s)]
*  I mean, look, I think Congressman Raskin, who you quoted earlier, is exactly right that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=240.24s)]
*  we were able to lay out the core facts that have now been included in this indictment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=246.24s)]
*  Facts make cases, not lawyers. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=255.12s)]
*  And we were only as good, the select committee was only as good as the facts we developed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=257.8s)]
*  It was pretty obvious to us early on in our investigation that there were a lot of pretty [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=262.74s)]
*  powerful facts here that demonstrated crimes and specifically intended plan, multi-part [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=268.32s)]
*  plan to disrupt the joint session. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=275.56s)]
*  So we did, I think, a very credible job laying out those facts. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=278.96s)]
*  But to be clear, it's the facts which are so compelling. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  It isn't the January 6th committee or even Jack Smith. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=285.32s)]
*  Really, it's the cards that we had to play that are now been passed to him. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=288.36s)]
*  I think he's added a few cards, likely has even strengthened that hand. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  But the facts here establish beyond likely any reasonable doubt that there were federal [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=297.68s)]
*  crimes committed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=303.88s)]
*  You said he may have added some new cards. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=304.8s)]
*  He may have added some new players. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=306.68s)]
*  Could you talk to us about the involvement of players who refused to come before your [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=307.92s)]
*  committee, people like Mike Pence, Mark Meadows, your reaction to what seems to be critical [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=311.52s)]
*  evidence from them that helped build the criminal case against Donald Trump? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=316.52s)]
*  Yeah, I look, I think it's clear from the indictment that take Mike Pence for an example, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=322.48s)]
*  he took contemporaneous notes of his conversations with President Trump. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=326.92s)]
*  He provided a direct account of their conversations when only the two of them were present. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  We knew generally, the select committee knew generally what happened in those conversations. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  But it's really powerful to have a participant in the conversation recount it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=340.92s)]
*  I think Pat Cipollone has given some additional information that he stopped short of providing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=345.48s)]
*  to us because of privilege. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  This is all because Jack Smith has the ability, because this is a criminal proceeding, to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=352.24s)]
*  immediately upstairs to the chief judge of the district court that is supervising the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=357.52s)]
*  grand jury and get rulings on privilege issues. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  We did not have that ability. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=365.84s)]
*  Congress does not have the same rules. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  Congressional oversight doesn't have the same rules as a criminal grand jury. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=370.64s)]
*  And that's why for us, it was civil litigation, which lawyers knew would not run its course [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=372.96s)]
*  before we expired. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=377.96s)]
*  So he's using that power to get more information and again, likely adding really important [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  new details to the core story that we sent forth. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  In a broad sense, was there anything, I guess, that surprised you about the indictment? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=387.72s)]
*  I mean, the information you didn't expect to see, for example, perhaps this charge that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=391.92s)]
*  we have talked about, this KKK charge that I don't believe was one of the recommended [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  charges from the January 6 committee. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=401.6s)]
*  No, I can't say anything surprised me. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=404.2s)]
*  There was a menu of statutes that could have been used. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=407.6s)]
*  There were more facts beyond those included in the indictment that could have been included. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=411.68s)]
*  The indictment was surgical. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=417.24s)]
*  I think it was clearly intended to position the case to get adjudicated most quickly, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=418.56s)]
*  a single defendant instead of the seven who are, who have criminal exposure as articulated [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  in the indictment and cases that are counts that have been really widely interpreted. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=429.56s)]
*  Obstruction of an official proceeding is the main vehicle that the Justice Department has [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=435.64s)]
*  been using in the blue collar January 6 cases. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=438.72s)]
*  So some of the other statutes are a little bit less clear in terms of the president. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=442.92s)]
*  It might have some free speech issues. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=448.04s)]
*  So I'm not surprised at all. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=450.16s)]
*  I think it was a calculated decision to try to get this case resolved as soon as possible. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  Tim, always a pleasure, sir. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=456.32000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time and for joining us this evening. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njV2telWCg0&t=458.72s)]
