# Joe Rogan to Trump: 'your weave is getting wide'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw)
*  All right, in Traverse City, Michigan, Donald Trump supporters waited for nearly three hours, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=0.0s)]
*  yes, three whole hours, to see their candidate last night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Some folks had to leave before the event even started. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=10.16s)]
*  He was delayed down in Austin, Texas, taping that sprawling three-hour interview with Joe [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=14.08s)]
*  Rogan. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=19.6s)]
*  The massively popular podcast allows its conversations to, quote, breathe, as they say. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=20.6s)]
*  The Joe Rogan Experience is known for going long, and that's helped it amass its primarily [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=25.8s)]
*  male audience. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=30.6s)]
*  And that goes hand in hand with Trump's focus lately on doing these so-called bro podcasts. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=32.0s)]
*  Trump and Rogan hit on a ton of topics, including Trump's view of R.F.K. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=38.04s)]
*  Jr. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=41.52s)]
*  R.F.K. is going to be very—you know, I think he's a great guy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  I think he's great. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=47.36s)]
*  I love the fact that you guys teamed up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=48.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=49.36s)]
*  And are you guys— [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=50.36s)]
*  In combination. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=51.36s)]
*  Are you completely committed to have him a part of your administration? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=52.36s)]
*  Oh, I am. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=53.36s)]
*  Numerous times, Trump praised Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, somehow connecting him [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=54.84s)]
*  in the same sentence to the UFC. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  He was in a war. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=65.48s)]
*  He was—and he was having a hard time, because he couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=66.48s)]
*  Robert E. Lee won, like, 13 battles in a row. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=69.88000000000001s)]
*  And he was getting, like, a phobia, like a fighter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=73.28s)]
*  You know, a lot about the fight stuff. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=75.68s)]
*  I went to a UFC fight, and it was a champion who was 14-1, about a year ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=79.16s)]
*  Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=86.6s)]
*  He was just beating the hell out of him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=88.64s)]
*  You know, they tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the North, but he said, no, I have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=89.92s)]
*  to be with my state. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  You know, the state was his whole thing, and he went to the South. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  And he was—I've had generals tell me, we have some great generals, the real generals, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=99.88s)]
*  not the ones you see on television, the ones that beat ISIS with me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=103.88s)]
*  We defeated ISIS in record time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=108.04s)]
*  It was supposed to take years, and we did it in a matter of weeks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=109.76s)]
*  These are great generals. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=113.68s)]
*  These are tough guys. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=115.12s)]
*  These are not woke guys. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=116.12s)]
*  But their favorite general, in terms of genius, was Robert E. Lee. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=117.36s)]
*  He took a war— [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  In terms of strategy, you mean? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  In terms of strategy, strategically. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  And in the most unexpected of detours, Trump touched on whales and his apparent concern [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=128.96s)]
*  about the impact of windmills on their psychology. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=136.24s)]
*  I want to be a whale psychiatrist. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=139.84s)]
*  It drives the whales fricking crazy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=143.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=146.32s)]
*  And something happens with them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=147.32s)]
*  But for whatever reason, they're getting washed up and sure, and, you know—and yet, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=148.72s)]
*  the environment— [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=153.2s)]
*  Conveniently ignored by the environmental people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=154.2s)]
*  Yeah, but the environmental—they don't talk about it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=155.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=157.56s)]
*  And you know that unique style of storytelling that Trump has, you know, in common language, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=158.56s)]
*  it's called rambling? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=167.24s)]
*  Trump says it's an art form called the weave. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=168.24s)]
*  Even at one point while he was doing the weave, Rogan actually called him out on it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=177.0s)]
*  I like to give wrong the weave. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=178.0s)]
*  You know, I like to give— [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=181.0s)]
*  You like to weave things in. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=182.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=183.0s)]
*  But when you do the weaves—and you have to be very smart to do weaves. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=184.0s)]
*  When you do the weave—look at this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=185.84s)]
*  Just in this one thing, we're talking about little pieces of it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=187.24s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  Gotta get back to home. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  It comes back home for the right people, for the wrong people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't come back home and they end up in the wilderness. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=194.32s)]
*  You're not a Kamala person. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=196.64s)]
*  You're a Khabib person, but you're not a Kamala person. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=198.12s)]
*  Nobody's going to know who Khabib is, but— [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=201.84s)]
*  Oh, they know who Khabib is. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=204.48s)]
*  He was not bad, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=205.84s)]
*  That guy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=206.84s)]
*  Oh, he was phenomenal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=207.84s)]
*  But that's your kind of person. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=208.84s)]
*  Your weave is getting wide. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=209.84s)]
*  We're getting wide with this weave. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=210.84s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=211.84s)]
*  My weave. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=212.84s)]
*  But isn't— [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=213.84s)]
*  I want to bring it back to tariffs. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=214.84s)]
*  I want to bring it back to tariffs. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=215.84s)]
*  I want to bring it back to common sense. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=216.84s)]
*  Dino Badella, Danielle Moudier with us. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=217.84s)]
*  So, you know, some people call it rambling. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=219.84s)]
*  Joe Ro—Downtrum called it the weave. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=222.24s)]
*  Joe Rogan was trying to kind of bring it in a little bit. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=224.2s)]
*  That's just BS. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=226.56s)]
*  I mean, let's just be honest about that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=227.56s)]
*  That's Donald Trump not knowing what he's talking about, BSing his way through three [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=229.88s)]
*  hours. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if it's because it was three hours and he didn't have the stamina and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  he was fatigued. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=237.84s)]
*  But the truth of the matter is he just doesn't know what he's talking about. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=239.46s)]
*  He's insane. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  He is insane. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  A whale psychiatrist? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump, like, that's going to be his job. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  Let's throw him in the ocean and see what happens. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Let's put him in the ocean and see. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  Like, let's put him in the ocean and see. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  Let's put him in the ocean and see. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  Let's put him in the ocean and see. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=252.84s)]
*  Like, let's see what happens. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=253.84s)]
*  Free Willy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=255.52s)]
*  But like, this is, it's not a weave. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  Like it is just, it is rambling lies because he's disoriented. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=259.6s)]
*  He doesn't know where he is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=264.24s)]
*  And you know what makes me so angry is that all of the people that sit down for interviews [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  with him, like, kind of usher him along like, you know, like a shepherd does with sheep. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  Like come on, lone sheep. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=275.44s)]
*  Like follow me here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=277.0s)]
*  The word is tariffs that they're like hanging in front of him, hoping to jog his memory [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=278.0s)]
*  as opposed to like, what the hell are you talking about? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=282.52s)]
*  There was actually, you know what I liked about the Joe Rogan podcast? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=285.88s)]
*  And this is what's so unique about Joe Rogan is that he let him have the three hours. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=289.36s)]
*  And I think even with the full three hours and just not interrupting him, not challenging [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=294.94s)]
*  him, not pressing him, you realize how bad Donald Trump is at speaking. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=299.8s)]
*  And it's partly because he's mentally no longer there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=304.88s)]
*  Like, you know, when you do these interviews, you're pressed for time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=307.44s)]
*  You're trying to keep it relevant. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=310.2s)]
*  You're trying to keep it on topic. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=311.5s)]
*  And so when you're having this back and forth as a journalist, you press him, you know, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=312.88s)]
*  he evades it, he comes back and then you run out of time and you move on and you realize [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=317.52s)]
*  you spent like 20 minutes, you don't get any answers. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=320.64s)]
*  Even with Joe Rogan giving him unlimited three hours, say whatever you want to say, he's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  going from Robert Lee to UFC to whale watching to Khabib to. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=328.96s)]
*  Look, I wish I could do that here on the show. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=334.2s)]
*  Can I just stay on for three hours? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=337.64s)]
*  It's a two hour show. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=338.92s)]
*  I know, but you can't have three hours on a two hour show. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=340.72s)]
*  I've interviewed doctors that Dr. John Gartner from Do You Know Warren and others who look [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=343.4s)]
*  at this and the word is not we, the word they will use. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=348.48s)]
*  I'm not a doctor, so I can't say, but they'll tell me it's dementia or it's steep cognitive [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=351.52s)]
*  decline and that this is part of it's not normal aging, it's advanced aging. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=356.32s)]
*  People get older, your memory gets a little harder to access words, thoughts, he's just [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  grappling to connecting in his brains, that's all this is. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=366.08s)]
*  So it's not a weed, it's like he gets lost, his brain goes afar and then something in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=369.44s)]
*  his brain goes like, we're talking about tariffs. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  And then they come back to test. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=376.2s)]
*  That's what's going on, you have a guy who's grappling cognitively and if he gets back [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=379.12s)]
*  in the office for four years with more pressure in the office, that's going to be expedited, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=384.32s)]
*  that dementia or that cognitive decline, whatever it is, and it's going to have, it'll be, I [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=389.41999999999996s)]
*  call it a pinno, a president name only, where he'll be controlled by his handlers. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=393.78s)]
*  They'll never 25th Amendment him, they'll just control him like a puppet. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=397.34s)]
*  J.D. Vance, Project 2025 guys, will be running everything behind the scenes, he'll sign [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=400.3s)]
*  everything, they'll give him a cheeseburger and a diet coke, that's it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  Push him off his room. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  That's exactly what they're going to do. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=409.09999999999997s)]
*  America should get ready for that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=411.09999999999997s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=412.46s)]
*  He won't make it for four years cognitively. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=413.46s)]
*  Speaking of Fox, when he goes on Fox, even Fox now edits his interviews because they [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=415.34s)]
*  know that the things that he says and rambles are just so detrimental to everything he is [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=418.7s)]
*  trying to do politically that they just can't even afford to let him do that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=424.5s)]
*  And yet the double standards again, with Donald Trump, Kamala Harris is going on, 60 minutes [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=430.09999999999997s)]
*  going into Fox, if you even want to call that a news organization. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=435.26s)]
*  She's doing, I believe, Brene Brown, you know, a tough interview, a long-form interview, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=442.34s)]
*  in-depth interview. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=446.58s)]
*  She's done Call Her Daddy. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=447.58s)]
*  She's done the whole gamut of things. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=448.78s)]
*  And this guy can't even make it through a three-hour, say whatever you want, interview [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=451.06s)]
*  without coming across like an idiot. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=455.17999999999995s)]
*  But funny enough is that all of these news outlets, the AP, the New York Times, the Washington [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=456.5s)]
*  Post and others will say, oh, because he mentioned the word tariff, he gave an economic speech [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=460.97999999999996s)]
*  on Rogan, right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=466.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  Oh, he mentioned the word— [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=468.65999999999997s)]
*  Tariffs, UFC, politics. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump— [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=472.42s)]
*  He mentions the word whale. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=473.42s)]
*  Donald Trump spent a long time talking about the environment. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=474.90000000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=477.46000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=478.46000000000004s)]
*  Like this is the kind of BS that we're up against right now. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=479.46000000000004s)]
*  And the reality is that Kamala Harris is playing chess, Donald Trump is playing with Plato, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=481.86s)]
*  and the media says they're both doing the same game. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=487.98s)]
*  It is definitely an interesting thing to see the fact that the media will spin some of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=491.82000000000005s)]
*  these things. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  I remember even when he was asked a question once about tariffs and he went on this rambling [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=497.34000000000003s)]
*  answer that made absolutely no sense about how he wants to impose tariffs and how that's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=501.34s)]
*  somehow good for the economy, when that wasn't even the question, the framing of it was Donald [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=506.54s)]
*  Trump talks about the economy and kind of assigns him things. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=510.54s)]
*  They try to basically fill in the gaps of his logic for him. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=515.02s)]
*  Are you saying there's some corporate media bias that helps Donald Trump and makes sense [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=518.86s)]
*  of things that are nonsensical? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=523.3s)]
*  Yes, that's a big part of it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=524.54s)]
*  Can I just say one quick thing about the bro vote strategy? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=526.54s)]
*  It's not a winner. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=529.5s)]
*  I hope everyone gets it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=530.5s)]
*  Why not? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=531.82s)]
*  Because first of all, young women in 2020 voted 11% higher than young men. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=532.82s)]
*  And since 1980, women vote about 10 points higher than men, including the early voting [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=537.62s)]
*  data so far. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=542.86s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=544.18s)]
*  Women 55% of the vote, 45% are men. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=545.18s)]
*  So these gender gaps that you see, it's a wash. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=547.42s)]
*  Trump's leading men by what Harris is leading by women. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=550.38s)]
*  That's not a wash. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=552.98s)]
*  That's not even close. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=553.98s)]
*  Women are coming out in much bigger numbers. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=555.66s)]
*  That's already happening in the early voting. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=557.34s)]
*  I want everyone to keep watching those numbers. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=559.7s)]
*  If that happens on exit polling election night in the battlegrounds, Vice President Harris [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=561.66s)]
*  wins. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=565.02s)]
*  That's really the key. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=566.02s)]
*  If that gets smaller, then I'm going to be deeply concerned. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=567.02s)]
*  But women are going to win this election. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=569.0600000000001s)]
*  They're going to save us. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=570.74s)]
*  Danielle, you're going to save us. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=571.74s)]
*  It would not be the first time that women have saved this country. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=574.5s)]
*  Certainly women of color have saved this country in previous elections, as we've seen. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQ5U487SNw&t=577.14s)]
