Video Description: Donald Trump is barreling toward 100 days in office, and the American people are giving him a reality check on his record. Polls ahead of that milestone are showing that more than half of U.S. adults aren't happy with his job performance as president or how he's approaching top MAGA policy areas like the economy and immigration. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin speaks with Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland about Trump's first months in office, what's ahead, and his efforts to push for accountability under Trump. "The country is in an uproar about this full-blown assault, both on democracy and the major achievements of democracy, like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid."

*  1940s it's a striking referendum on the dramatic shifts that have come to define the past few months [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=85.76s)]
*  We've watched Trump up and long established precedents and signed more than 100 executive orders in an attempt to remake [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  The US government in his image. He's taken his attacks on critics to new extremes taking aim at [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=97.76s)]

*  Intensely escalated immigration enforcement by deporting immigrants that even include US citizens [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=112.9s)]
*  It is safe to say that he is testing the limits of presidential power [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  What could happen in the next 100 days? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=123.94s)]
*  What has officials say we can expect the administration to focus on trade deals and peace talks in the words of one Trump official? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=126.7s)]
*  There are quote lots of torpedoes under the water and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=133.82s)]
*  Executive actions are going to continue like a quote snowball running downhill [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=137.54s)]
*  Trump's unpopular policies will soon face a huge test as well [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=142.62s)]
*  He is asking GOP lawmakers to deliver on his big beautiful bill to extend tax cuts slash an estimated [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=146.14s)]
*  $1.5 trillion in federal spending and fund his crackdown on immigration [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=154.34s)]
*  And of course as Congress returns from recess Republicans face a major test of unity to pass that spending plan after [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=158.78s)]
*  Muscling through a budget framework earlier this month [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  Also on the table the question surrounding Trump's demands to some of the country's largest law firms and whether he has violated [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=169.9s)]
*  the law [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=177.5s)]
*  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal and congressman Jamie Raskin recently wrote to five of those law firms [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=178.78s)]
*  Which made deals with the president before he could target them in executive orders [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=184.52s)]
*  They write quote your agreement makes you complicit in efforts to undermine the rule of law and to turn private attorneys [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  Into President Trump's personal law firm starting us off this Sunday one of the authors of that letter [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=197.16000000000003s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland congressman. It's great to have you back on the show [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  Before we get into the specifics of that letter [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=209.6s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts as we near the 100-day mark of Donald Trump's second term [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=211.8s)]
*  It is hard to imagine that it's only been about a hundred days given what some say is this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=216.86s)]
*  Unprecedented damage that has but it has been done to our federal government. What are you hearing from your constituents? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=223.4s)]
*  And what strikes you about this three-month mark for Trump's second term? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=228.36s)]
*  Well, good great anguish and upset both among my constituents in Maryland's beautiful eighth district [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=233.12s)]
*  But across Maryland across the country [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=239.4s)]
*  You know Donald Trump destroyed six to seven trillion dollars in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=242.12s)]
*  Retirement savings and individual and company wealth he plunged us into a trade war with the entire world [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=247.52s)]
*  Except for his buddies in Moscow [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=254.32s)]
*  He's been wrecking federal departments and agencies [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  By firing people wholesale without any due process at all and of course, he's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=260.84s)]
*  Been trampling due process when it comes to the rights of immigrants in the country [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=267.4s)]
*  So it's pretty much a horror show the good news is that people are standing up all over the country [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  We've got institutions like Harvard University and like Wilmer Hale [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=277.4s)]
*  That are standing up against this and leading the way forward [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=283.88s)]
*  We've got labor unions like AFG the AFL-CIO itself, which have said no way so [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  The country is in an uproar about this full-blown assault both on democracy and the major [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  achievements of democracy like Social Security Medicare and Medicaid where they want to cut [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=300.24s)]
*  880 billion dollars [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=306.48s)]
*  Over the next couple weeks, so that's the coming showdown as we come back to Congress this week [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  And I certainly admire and respect sir your optimism [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  But on the other side of that you have universities like Columbia that have capitulated [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  And as you and your colleague Senator Richard Blumenthal have ran into some of the top law firms demanding [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=321.8s)]
*  Transparency and accountability there's concern that those law firms [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  Powerful law firms have also [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  capitulated what is important for viewers to know about these deals between the Trump administration and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=332.68s)]
*  These law firms and in what ways if at all do you believe any of this action any of their actions? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=339.16s)]
*  May have violated the law [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=346.12s)]
*  Well the first thing to note is there's no safety in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=349.88000000000005s)]
*  appeasing [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=353.48s)]
*  Authoritarians so Donald Trump comes forward and says for the first time in American history [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm mad at this law firm and that law firm and that law firm [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=358.44000000000005s)]
*  And I'm not going to allow any of you into federal buildings including court houses [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to revoke your federal security clearance [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=366.52s)]
*  I'm going to deny you federal contracts because I don't like what one of your lawyers or one of your former lawyers [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  Once did it's obviously blatantly unconstitutional and yet so many law firms led by Paul Weiss Rifkin [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=374.2s)]
*  Just gave in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=380.91999999999996s)]
*  out of fear that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  You know they were going to be trampled in the process and somehow they thought they could deal with this monster [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  And somehow they thought they could deal with this monster, but the law firms that have stood up [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=392.44000000000005s)]
*  like [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=398.68s)]
*  Perkins Cooey and Sussman Godfrey and Wilmer Hale have shown the way because they went to court and within a matter of days [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=399.56s)]
*  They got injunctions [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=406.12s)]
*  Against this lawlessness which obviously violates the freedom of speech the right to counsel due process and so on [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  And it's the same thing with Harvard University [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  You've got Columbia on one hand which buckled under and now they're continuing to be [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=417.32s)]
*  Shaken down by the administration. You've got Harvard which said no way [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=423.48s)]
*  You're not going to run our university and that's a much safer way to go [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=427.64s)]
*  But donald trump shook down the law firms for nearly a billion dollars in [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=431.32s)]
*  Pro bono legal aid meaning that they're going to be having their you know junior associates working for donald trump and his [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=436.66s)]
*  Pet pro bono causes whether it's anti-choice or anti-environment or anti-union [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=443.64s)]
*  That means those firms are going to be conflicted out of doing pro-choice pro-union pro-environment work [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=449.32s)]
*  There is no safety in appeasing [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=455.32s)]
*  Authoritarians and of course, you know, you know our citizens would expect that the FBI would also do its part [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=458.34s)]
*  You're asking for an FBI investigation and trump's pick for us attorney in dc ed martin who failed to disclose [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=463.56s)]
*  I believe more than 150 appearances he made on russian media over the past eight years [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=472.52s)]
*  He was supposed to provide a breakdown of all of his commentary. He has not done that one [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=477.48s)]
*  Why do you think that's important? And two? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=483.16s)]
*  Can this fbi under the leadership of cash pittel which to some you know has operated as trump's law enforcement agency? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=485.8s)]
*  Actually going to investigate this in a meaningful and serious way [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=494.28s)]
*  Well, they they certainly must do that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=498.14s)]
*  It's pretty shocking that in reporting his media appearances. He categorically omitted [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=501.73999999999995s)]
*  his regular appearances over a seven or eight year period on [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  Russia today and on sputnik which are basically russian propaganda channels that ended up having to [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=515.42s)]
*  Register as russian agents because the u.s. Government insisted that they do that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=522.14s)]
*  He just omitted those and dropped those and so what we're asking [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=527.02s)]
*  Cash pittel to investigate what we want the fbi and the department of justice to probe is whether this was a deliberate [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=531.9s)]
*  Categorical omission of all these appearances or whether it was somehow [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=539.02s)]
*  Accidental or negligent we need some explanation of why and then we need to know what exactly [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=543.1800000000001s)]
*  Is his relationship to russian intelligence and counterintelligence russian? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=548.22s)]
*  propaganda [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=555.0s)]
*  Entities and to vladimir putin obviously we need to know that that's not the only problem with the u.s. Attorney [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=556.22s)]
*  Designate ed martin [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=562.6s)]
*  In any event this is a guy who was there on january 6th who described it as marty graw who has participated [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=564.22s)]
*  in every form of january 6th denialism [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=571.34s)]
*  And then was representing january 6th defendants and even when he became [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=575.26s)]
*  The acting u.s. Attorney and went into the government he dropped charges against his own clients [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=580.38s)]
*  Against his own defendants. He was operating on both sides of the v [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=587.26s)]
*  On the government side and also on the defendant side, which is just unheard of it's just like a hallmark violation [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=591.26s)]
*  Of ethics he's also praised [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwGnTtkQB0&t=598.7s)]
