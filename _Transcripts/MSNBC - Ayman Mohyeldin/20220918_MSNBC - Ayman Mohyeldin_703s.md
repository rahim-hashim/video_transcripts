# Rep. Ted Lieu: “In America, The Law Is Applied Equally. No One Is Above The Law.”
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8)
*  Hey there, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we start with a series of new developments stemming from the FBI search of Trump's Florida [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=3.36s)]
*  home last month. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  And just within the last 24 hours, the Justice Department filed an appeal to temporarily [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=10.68s)]
*  block parts of a judge's order that stopped them from examining the classified documents [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  that were seized in that search. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=20.68s)]
*  Now, the department asked a federal appeals court in Atlanta to immediately lift the hold [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=22.76s)]
*  and let them resume their work, claiming the delay, quote, impedes the government's efforts [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=28.02s)]
*  to protect the nation's security. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=33.62s)]
*  Now, the motion was in response to an order that was issued by Trump-appointed District [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=35.78s)]
*  Court Judge Eileen Cannon that was done earlier this week, denying the Justice Department's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=40.86s)]
*  request to exclude classified documents from a special master's review of the material [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=45.94s)]
*  that was seized. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=51.64s)]
*  Cannon named Raymond Deary, a former New York federal judge, as that special master. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=53.38s)]
*  And the decision from Judge Cannon will likely significantly delay the Department of Justice's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=58.38s)]
*  probe, which is looking into just exactly how classified material ended up at Trump's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=62.94s)]
*  residence. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=69.5s)]
*  Now, according to new reporting from The Washington Post and a call last year with members of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=70.5s)]
*  Trump's team, National Archives officials were told that none, none of the material [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=74.94s)]
*  in Trump's possessions was sensitive or classified and that Trump had only 12 boxes of, quote, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=80.44s)]
*  news clippings that he stored at his home. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, since that call, federal officials have recovered 42 boxes of records from Trump's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=89.72s)]
*  residence, including 15 boxes handed over by his representatives to the archives last [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=94.88s)]
*  January and an additional 27 boxes retrieved by the FBI last month. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=100.44s)]
*  And as we now know, some of that material was marked with the highest, and I repeat, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=106.84s)]
*  the highest classification levels suggesting those documents contain some of the government's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=112.36s)]
*  most sensitive and secretive information. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=117.76s)]
*  Now, so much for news clippings. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=120.56s)]
*  And this isn't the only legal battle that Team Trump is fighting with the Justice Department. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=124.4s)]
*  This week, we learned that the DOJ issued dozens of subpoenas related to Trump and his [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=129.12s)]
*  and their efforts to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=134.11999999999998s)]
*  While that number was first reported to be around 40, sources close to Trump told Politico [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  the number of subpoenas issued could actually be between 50 and 75. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=141.72s)]
*  That's how broad the investigation into election subversion has grown. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=146.72s)]
*  The aggressive step comes amid new reporting that ex-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=151.32s)]
*  has now complied with a subpoena from the Justice Department in that investigation, making him [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=156.44s)]
*  the highest ranking Trump official to have cooperated thus far. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=162.12s)]
*  And as the walls once again begin to close in on Donald Trump, he's going back to his [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=167.08s)]
*  old habits, spreading lies, spreading conspiracies. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=172.56s)]
*  But even worse, we all know those lies can lead to real violence, and Trump seems to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=177.1s)]
*  almost be counting on that if things don't go his way. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=181.28s)]
*  In fact, here's how he responded just this week when asked about a possible indictment. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=185.12s)]
*  I think if it happened, I think you'd have problems in this country, the likes of which [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=191.56s)]
*  perhaps we've never seen before. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=196.12s)]
*  I don't think the people of the United States would stand for it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=198.28s)]
*  What kind of problems, Mr. President? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=202.16s)]
*  I think they'd have big problems, big problems. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=203.44s)]
*  I just don't think they'd stand for it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=206.0s)]
*  They will not, they will not sit still and stand for this ultimate of hoaxes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=207.68s)]
*  All right, let's discuss this now with Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu of California. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=212.52s)]
*  He's a member of the House Judiciary Committee, a former Trump impeachment manager. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=217.04s)]
*  And we should note a former Air Force JAG prosecutor. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=221.16s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to see you in New York in person. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=223.72s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=226.8s)]
*  You're our first in-person guest on this show in almost a year. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=227.8s)]
*  So thank you so much for making time for us. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=231.4s)]
*  Thank you, Eamon. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=233.8s)]
*  I'm honored to be here and to be your first guest since the pandemic. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=234.8s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=237.04s)]
*  Listen, there's a lot to discuss. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  I'd like to get your thoughts first of all on what happens if this appeal by the Department [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  of Justice does not, is not granted basically. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=244.24s)]
*  We have learned from the government's position that it would do serious damage to the government's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=248.2s)]
*  ability to protect national security and state secrets if in fact they are not granted this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=253.72s)]
*  appeal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=259.92s)]
*  What do you make of how this is playing out right now? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=260.92s)]
*  I had a security clearance before Congress and in Congress I have a top secret security [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=262.64s)]
*  clearance. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=267.56s)]
*  If I had secret or top secret documents in my home, I would have been arrested and indicted. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=269.2s)]
*  The lower court's ruling is insane. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=275.32s)]
*  She is basically suggesting that there's a dispute whether or not these documents are [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=278.6s)]
*  classified. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=282.64s)]
*  If they are marked secret or top secret, they are classified. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=284.0s)]
*  And more than that, these are not Donald Trump's documents. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=287.96s)]
*  The taxpayers funded these documents. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=290.6s)]
*  The taxpayers own these documents, not the ex-president. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  Judge Cannon appointed a special master here in New York. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=297.04s)]
*  What do you make of the fact that you would just have a judge, although a very credible [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  and well-respected judge here in New York, look over the contents, but just the idea [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=305.28s)]
*  of having the state secrets that are, as we mentioned, at one point supposed to have had [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=309.68s)]
*  the highest classification within that system now being reviewed by a judge? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=314.08s)]
*  These secrets are so potentially damaging to U.S. national security they could put Americans' [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=322.24s)]
*  lives at risk that you have to look at these documents in a special room and you have to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=327.38s)]
*  get special permission for some of these documents. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=332.8s)]
*  Just because I have a top secret clearance, I can't even look at some of these documents. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=335.36s)]
*  I have to get additional approvals. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=339.24s)]
*  So to just have additional people keep putting their eyes on these documents is risky to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=341.44s)]
*  our national security. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=346.6s)]
*  And I really think that this lower court ruling is crazy for another reason. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=348.16s)]
*  She is basically suggesting that somehow these documents can be posted on the front pages [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=352.68s)]
*  of the New York Times and somehow they're declassified. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=358.96s)]
*  So there is no evidence whatsoever that they should be declassified. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=362.88000000000005s)]
*  Yes, so let's talk about that disconnect. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=365.88000000000005s)]
*  On one hand, you're saying the documents should be reviewed by a judge, but at the same time [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=366.88000000000005s)]
*  you have the president going on radio or doing interviews and saying that he basically declassified [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=372.68s)]
*  the material. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=378.44000000000005s)]
*  How does one wrap their head around that? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=379.44000000000005s)]
*  If the president is saying they're declassified, but then at the same time you have a judge [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=381.88s)]
*  saying we need a special master to review the classification of these documents, which [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  is it? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=390.16s)]
*  Let's first of all be clear, ex-president Donald Trump does not even have a security [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=391.16s)]
*  clearance. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=395.24s)]
*  And then if he had declassified these documents, this is what would have happened. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=396.6s)]
*  He would have had to tell someone. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=400.92s)]
*  He can't declassify them in his own mind. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=402.6s)]
*  He told someone, they were told the office that deals with classification documents said, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=405.36s)]
*  okay, these documents are declassified. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=409.48s)]
*  You know what would happen? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  The Biden administration on day one would have reclassified them because it is insane [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=413.08000000000004s)]
*  that these documents can appear on the front pages of any newspaper. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  Because you can't just declassify documents for one person. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=420.72s)]
*  It doesn't work that way. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=423.6s)]
*  If they're declassified, you get to see it, my cousin gets to see it, your dentist gets [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=424.6s)]
*  to see it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=429.24s)]
*  So that's just crazy all around. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=430.24s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt about it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you about the broader investigation into the attempt to overturn the election. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  As we were reporting, their subpoenas have gone out. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=437.48s)]
*  Initially reported around 40. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  Now could be as many as 50 to 75. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=441.8s)]
*  What do you make of the scope of the investigation as we learn more details about it in terms [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=444.72s)]
*  of what it is the Department of Justice is beginning to piece together with these subpoenas? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=449.32s)]
*  In America, there's not one set of laws for ex-president Donald Trump and his associates [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=456.28s)]
*  and another set of laws for everyone else. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=462.08s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  In America, the law applies equally. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  No one is above the law. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=468.56s)]
*  And that's what the foreign justice is doing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=469.94s)]
*  They're going to apply the law. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=471.6s)]
*  In addition to these subpoenas, what people should be really scared of if they're a Trump [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=473.2s)]
*  associate is these seizures, because these seizures of phones and these searches of different [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=478.16s)]
*  places had to be approved by a federal judge. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=483.68s)]
*  And that federal judge would have had to find a probable cause that evidence of a crime [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=487.2s)]
*  was going to be found in that phone. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=492.72s)]
*  Do you think that now as we enter this so-called 60-day period before a midterm election where [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=494.92s)]
*  the Department of Justice kind of goes into this quiet phase not to appear influencing, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=501.04s)]
*  if you will, or being involved in politics ahead of a midterm election, do you think [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=508.24s)]
*  that we are entering into a dangerous period where President Trump is more or less on the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  ballot, the ex-president is on the ballot because of his ideology, the big lie candidates [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=518.0s)]
*  that are running in these races, and the Department of Justice now has its hands tied a little [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=524.44s)]
*  bit because of a political calculation? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=530.4s)]
*  Well, I agree with you that ex-president Donald Trump is on the ballot. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=532.28s)]
*  So is abortion. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=537.76s)]
*  And Democrats have been putting people over politics and we've been working on lowering [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=539.3199999999999s)]
*  costs and safer communities and bigger paychecks. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=542.64s)]
*  And you've got Republicans who want to criminalize abortion nationwide. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=546.24s)]
*  So all of this is on the ballot. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=549.6s)]
*  I do not think that the Department of Justice, however, would indict the ex-president in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=551.04s)]
*  the next 60 days or so. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=555.92s)]
*  And by the way, I do agree with Donald Trump that if he were indicted, the country would [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=557.36s)]
*  see problems we've never seen before because there would be a large spontaneous amount [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=562.2800000000001s)]
*  of people dancing in the streets. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  And we need people to deal with that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=568.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's actually what happened when he got kicked out of office. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=569.88s)]
*  People went and danced in the streets. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=572.62s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  I remember Election Day without a doubt and certainly when the election was called, the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  celebrations that were taking place. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=576.96s)]
*  But speaking of that, what did you make of this sound that we played of Donald Trump, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  more or less warning of violence if he were indicted? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=583.2s)]
*  Is that something that concerns you? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=587.5200000000001s)]
*  Do you genuinely believe that he has riled up his base enough, him and others, including [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=589.5200000000001s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, that if in fact this president is indicted, which many believe he should [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=595.1600000000001s)]
*  be, we could potentially see violence in America? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=599.5200000000001s)]
*  I actually do see we will see dancing in the streets and we'll see what happened during [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=603.4000000000001s)]
*  the prior election when he got kicked out. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  There was dancing in the streets. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=611.24s)]
*  Now, in terms of violence, it is always something that could happen because you have Republicans, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=612.48s)]
*  especially MAG Republicans, continue to push political violence. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=618.0s)]
*  I do think that even MAG Republicans are seeing what's happening with January 6 and the insurrectionists [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=621.9599999999999s)]
*  being sent to prison or jail, that they may think twice about doing additional violence. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=628.16s)]
*  And really quickly before I go, let me just ask you, how do you feel the Democrats' chances [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=634.1s)]
*  are ahead of the midterms? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=638.04s)]
*  We've seen some special races in which Democrats surprisingly won. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=639.32s)]
*  As you said, abortion is on the ballot this year. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=642.7600000000001s)]
*  Has that issue and what it means for Americans changed the dynamics of the midterm? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=645.48s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of Americans know that these are deeply personal, private decisions [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=652.7600000000001s)]
*  and that a woman should make that decision in consultation with her doctor, her family [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=658.72s)]
*  and her God and that that decision should not be made by Senator Lindsey Graham or other [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=663.9s)]
*  MAGA politicians. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=669.9s)]
*  Congressman Ted Lieu, greatly appreciate it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=671.9s)]
*  It's great to see you in person. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=673.9s)]
*  Thank you for making time for us, sir. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=675.26s)]
*  Thank you, Eamon. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=676.5799999999999s)]
*  Take care. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUEHBX5pzm8&t=677.5799999999999s)]
