# What The Supreme Court’s Concealed Carry Decision Means For The Future Of Gun Legislation
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM)
*  The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision this week to strike down New York's century-old gun [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=0.0s)]
*  law was, quote, probably the most significant expansion of gun rights from the Supreme Court [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  in the country's history. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=13.4s)]
*  That's according to our next guest, Michael Waldman, the author of the Second Amendment [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=15.4s)]
*  of Biography, which was cited in Justice Stephen Breyer's dissent. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=19.68s)]
*  The decision stripped local officials of broad authority to deny permits to gun owners who [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=24.0s)]
*  want to carry weapons outside of their home for almost any reason. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=29.4s)]
*  The ruling is also set to nullify laws in a handful of other states that have similarly [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=33.24s)]
*  strong concealed carry licensing laws. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=38.32s)]
*  Joining me now is Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=40.76s)]
*  Michael, good to see you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=44.92s)]
*  So do you believe this decision is actually bigger than Heller, the last major Second [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=46.92s)]
*  Amendment Supreme Court decision from the court? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  And if so, why is that? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think it likely will be because Heller was the very first time the Supreme Court [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  ever said that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to gun ownership. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  It was only in 2008. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  It was recent. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  But it spoke about protecting Hearth and home. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=75.56s)]
*  This of course strikes down New York's law. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  And as a New Yorker, I'm not thrilled about the many more guns that will be carried in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  a crowded place. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=87.4s)]
*  When the Second Amendment was ratified, there were 33,000 people living in New York. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=89.04s)]
*  Now there are 8.8 million. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=94.36s)]
*  But the implications and why I think it's such a big deal go well beyond this particular [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=96.4s)]
*  law. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=101.16s)]
*  What the Supreme Court said, what Justice Clarence Thomas said is, you can't balance [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=102.16s)]
*  the individual right against public safety, against protecting against violence and crime. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=106.44s)]
*  You can only look at quote, history and tradition. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=112.44s)]
*  And what this means is that the NRA and other gun rights advocates are going to be able [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=117.24s)]
*  to go into court and challenge hundreds of gun laws that have been upheld by the courts [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=122.84s)]
*  and say you did it wrong. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=129.84s)]
*  The Supreme Court says you need to look back and find out about what they did with the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=131.6s)]
*  muskets and what they were doing way back then. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=135.36s)]
*  And it's a big, big onslaught coming of attacks on gun laws. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so that kind of begs the question. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=144.36s)]
*  Do you see other gun regulations also at risk at this point? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=147.24s)]
*  Yes, not just laws about carrying concealed weapons, but all the other things that have [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=152.08s)]
*  been upheld since Heller by dozens and dozens and dozens of federal judges, state judges, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=157.24s)]
*  Republican and Democratic appointed judges that said, yeah, it's an individual right, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=164.24s)]
*  but society also has rights. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  90% of gun laws have been upheld in the last dozen years or so. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=172.08s)]
*  Those are all at risk. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=176.4s)]
*  And it is like with the abortion case, evidence of the way the current super majority on the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Supreme Court kind of very selectively picks through the historical record looking for [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=186.24s)]
*  evidence rather than asking what we ought to be doing now as a society. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  As we saw with Clarence Thomas's invitation for other challenges to come in the privacy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=198.16s)]
*  space, whether it's Roe, Abogafel, et cetera, do you think that this New York case serves [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  as a challenge for those to bring lawsuits in the future? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  I think so. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  It clearly tells all these judges you did it wrong. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=219.44s)]
*  It tells the NRA, which is bankrupt and a husk of itself, but nevertheless gets a do-over [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=222.56s)]
*  on these laws. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=229.4s)]
*  And what's striking is the notion when you read the opinion, there's just no mention [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=231.88s)]
*  of public safety today, of the real conditions of Americans today. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=239.08s)]
*  Justice Alito in his concurrence chides Breyer, Justice Breyer, for bringing up the mass shootings [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=245.96s)]
*  and the gun violence like it's kind of impolite to do it, like special pleading on behalf [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=253.28s)]
*  of these gun victims. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=258.76s)]
*  Unfortunately, that kind of thing is a signal to people to come and challenge these laws. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=260.44s)]
*  It also makes it more complicated for states and cities and the federal government to know [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=266.12s)]
*  what kinds of laws will be constitutional. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=272.04s)]
*  It's a moment where we just saw the first bipartisan agreement on gun legislation in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=275.48s)]
*  three decades. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=281.12s)]
*  I don't think that's at risk, but in some senses, the country has had a real awakening [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  and a coming together on some of these gun issues on the one hand, and at the same moment [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=287.44s)]
*  the Supreme Court has lurched in a very different direction. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=291.68s)]
*  You anticipated my next question about the law that was recently signed by President [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=295.44s)]
*  Biden. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  You don't see that at risk, but are there—is that because it's not as threatening to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=302.76s)]
*  the gun community, or why is there less risk with that law as signed by the president? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=309.68s)]
*  Well, mostly it's not about regulation of guns as much as funding for mental health [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=316.28s)]
*  and things like that, although certainly issues like red flag laws, which say that somebody [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=321.44s)]
*  health, violent tendencies or domestic violence or other things can have their guns taken [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=329.2s)]
*  away. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=334.8s)]
*  You will see people saying, oh, that violates their sacred right to keep and bear arms. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=335.8s)]
*  But generally speaking, the way the law was written, it's less about gun regulation than [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=341.76s)]
*  about investing in other things. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=346.76s)]
*  But look, it was certainly constitutional a week ago. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  I think it's constitutional now, but they have to spend some time looking at it to make [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=352.46s)]
*  sure. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSmojvzsvM&t=357.28s)]
