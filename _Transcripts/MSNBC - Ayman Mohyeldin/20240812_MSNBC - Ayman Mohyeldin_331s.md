# From Taylor Swift to Jake Paul: How much does celebrity influence matter in elections?
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE)
*  Far-right activist and agitator Matt Walsh recently posted on X with some advice from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=0.0s)]
*  his MAGA Republican cohorts. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Quote, Kamala Harris has all of the big-name entertainers on her side, all of them. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=8.76s)]
*  Please, do not try to counter this by parading around a bunch of washed-up or obscure entertainers [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=14.4s)]
*  that nobody cares about. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=19.7s)]
*  This just makes us look sad and irrelevant. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=21.56s)]
*  Yes, it was a rare moment of self-awareness from the right, and he had a point. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=24.16s)]
*  There is, to say the least, a stark difference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=29.92s)]
*  celebrity endorsements. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=34.88s)]
*  Harris has a bunch of A-listers backing her, like Charli XCX, who said it herself, Kamala [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=36.52s)]
*  is Bratz, or Beyonce, who allowed Harris to use her freedom at her campaign events, or [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=42.08s)]
*  Megan Thee Stallion, who performed at a PAC rally in Atlanta last month. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  And not to mention an endorsement from actor George Clooney. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=53.96s)]
*  As for Trump's big A-list backers, well, A-list, he's got somebody. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=58.28s)]
*  He's got Kid Rock, and he's got wrestler Hulk Hogan. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=65.0s)]
*  Both of them were at the Republican National Convention. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=69.12s)]
*  And he's also being backed by Superman actor Dean Cain, has-been Hercules actor Kevin Sorbo, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  and Dennis Quaid of, wait for it, parent-trap fame. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=80.16s)]
*  Now, I can't speak for everybody else, but I come from a place called 2024, and in there, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=85.52s)]
*  we would call all of those dudes washed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=91.48s)]
*  But the big question is, what is it actually worth? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  How much of a difference can these endorsements actually make in a presidential election, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=98.08s)]
*  regardless of how popular or how relevant a person may be elsewhere? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=103.04s)]
*  As Vox puts it, if you're one of the most famous influential women in the world, you [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=108.04s)]
*  may be able to sway a presidential election a little. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=112.6s)]
*  If not, the effect might be a bit more limited. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=115.52s)]
*  No, I'm not talking about Taylor Swift. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=118.24s)]
*  We are going to talk about her in a minute. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=120.44s)]
*  Calm down. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=122.32s)]
*  I'm talking about Oprah Winfrey, who back in 2007 endorsed Barack Obama. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=123.32s)]
*  For the very first time in my life, I feel compelled to stand up and to speak out for [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  the man who I believe has a new vision for America. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=139.76s)]
*  I am not here to tell you what to think. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=144.28s)]
*  I am here to ask you to think seriously. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=149.16s)]
*  Winfrey's is actually a rare example of an endorsement that made a big impact. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=156.04s)]
*  A 2013 Northwestern University study found that she increased overall voter turnout and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=161.68s)]
*  financial contributions, and she was responsible for one million additional votes for President [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=167.32s)]
*  Obama. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  There's an important caveat. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=174.04s)]
*  That was actually a Democratic primary when voters were choosing from the candidates with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=175.28s)]
*  the same party affiliation rather than a general election. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=179.6s)]
*  But what if we apply that logic to today? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=183.4s)]
*  There's a buzz around a Harris endorsement from Swift who did endorse Biden back in 2020. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  That speculation increased after her recent Instagram photo featuring a silhouette of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=193.62s)]
*  a figure in a pantsuit, which some seem to believe was a wink and a nod at Harris. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=197.46s)]
*  Don't forget, Swifties for Kamala, which launched last month and already has some 87,000 followers [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=203.3s)]
*  across X and Instagram. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=210.22s)]
*  Their organizing efforts kick off at the end of the month. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=212.34s)]
*  Now we have to wonder what influence a Swift endorsement could have in this moment. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=215.5s)]
*  Back in 2018, Vote.org said her post endorsing a Tennessee Democratic state Senate candidate [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=220.78s)]
*  got 65,000 people registered to vote. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=226.38s)]
*  Now since then, Swift's fame has only grown. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=230.22s)]
*  But what if all of the A-list star power isn't a foolproof plan? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=232.94s)]
*  Maybe instead it's about meeting voters where they are. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=238.46s)]
*  That is to say, celebrities who aren't necessarily household names but still have influence in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=241.74s)]
*  their own right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=246.82s)]
*  Think about another kind of star, the Dude Bro influencers for example, on YouTube and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=248.38s)]
*  TikTok like Bryce Hall, FaZe Banks and the Paul brothers. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=252.98s)]
*  Each of them has millions of subscribers. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  Back in June, Trump made an appearance on Logan Paul's podcast. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=261.06s)]
*  It's giving white boy summer. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=278.38s)]
*  That video has more than 6 million views. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=287.42s)]
*  Now on the left, there's also been momentum for a haves among progressive content creators [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=290.06s)]
*  and even a push to get her on Hot Ones. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=294.26s)]
*  That's a wildly popular internet show where guests are interviewed while they eat progressively [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=296.94s)]
*  spicier chicken wings. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=301.34s)]
*  So what's worth more, an A-list endorsement or an appearance with a popular influencer? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=303.34s)]
*  Or is it just all shameless pandering? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jxb_se7EpE&t=308.58s)]
