# How the Michigan effort to vote against Biden in primary could help him in November
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA)
*  Two effort is underway in Michigan ahead of the state's February 27 presidential primary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=0.0s)]
*  Our Revolution, a progressive political organization, has called on voters to cast their ballot [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=5.36s)]
*  against President Joe Biden in the upcoming Democratic primary, urging them to select [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=10.24s)]
*  uncommitted instead. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=14.98s)]
*  The group hopes the move will send the president a message and shift the administration's approach [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=16.84s)]
*  to the war in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=22.04s)]
*  Saturday, Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib voiced her support for a similar effort [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=23.6s)]
*  from another group called Listen to Michigan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=27.8s)]
*  Biden's erosion of support in the state is a subject of concern for his reelection campaign. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=30.76s)]
*  According to census data, Michigan has roughly 310,000 residents with Middle Eastern or North [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=36.56s)]
*  African ancestry, and Arab Americans can account for as much as 5% of the vote in the state, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  depending on turnout. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  New polling shows Donald Trump narrowly leads the president in the key battleground state [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=50.8s)]
*  by just two points. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  With numbers that close, though, Democrats are sounding the alarm, warning Joe Biden's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=56.98s)]
*  handling of the war could cause voters in this crucial bloc to sit out in the November [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  election. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  One local activist from Dearborn told USA Today, quote, It is time for the president [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=67.38s)]
*  to take action, and he is failing to do so, and that's going to have political consequences. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=72.34s)]
*  Explaining his reasoning for backing our revolution's uncommitted effort, former Michigan Democratic [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=77.94s)]
*  Congressman Andy Levin told the New York Times, quote, I am working with some people who feel [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=84.34s)]
*  like they will never vote for Joe Biden, but there are many, many, many I feel will vote [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=88.66000000000001s)]
*  for the president on November 5th if he changes course. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=93.78s)]
*  This is the best way I can help Joe Biden. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  Former Congressman Andy Levin joins me now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=101.18s)]
*  Congressman, former Congressman Levin, it's great to see you again. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=103.7s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  And I actually want to start there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  You're framing this vote as a way to help Joe Biden ahead of November. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=110.74s)]
*  Some Michigan Democrats, including the state's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, have cautioned [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=116.06s)]
*  that whipping support against Joe Biden could and will backfire. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=120.38s)]
*  Explain to our viewers why you don't believe that's the case. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=126.22s)]
*  Well, it's great to see you, Eamon. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=129.62s)]
*  And first of all, Governor Whitmer is a co-chair of the president's reelection campaign. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=132.9s)]
*  She's doing a great job and she's playing her role very well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=137.06s)]
*  But here's the situation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden needs to do this for two reasons. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=143.5s)]
*  And I have to say the first one is about substance, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=146.86s)]
*  What is happening is horrifying in Gaza. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=150.9s)]
*  The situation on the West Bank is terrible. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=154.34s)]
*  Both Israelis and Palestinians are completely traumatized. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  And so this president, who I was so proud to make so much progress with on domestic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=162.38s)]
*  policy and who has done such a terrific job there, can be a great foreign policy president [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=167.04s)]
*  if he changes course, really changes course, gets a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and opens [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=173.26s)]
*  up the biggest diplomatic initiative of his presidency to at long last allow the Palestinian [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=179.44s)]
*  people to have self-determination along with the Jewish people having self-determination [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=186.26s)]
*  together. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  Somehow it's difficult, but sharing, deciding, they decide, not us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=192.5s)]
*  They decide how to share that land democratically. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  And so here the political situation, though, Eamon, is this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=199.66s)]
*  It's not our revolution or listen to Michigan like whipping this up. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=203.22s)]
*  People are not going to vote for Joe Biden on February 27th because they are really mad [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  at him. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=214.22s)]
*  Their cousins are dying. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  Their friends are dying. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=216.66s)]
*  And it's not just Arab Americans. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=219.22s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=221.46s)]
*  We are the densest Arab American state. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=222.06s)]
*  We also have two hundred and fifty thousand Muslims in Michigan. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=224.26000000000002s)]
*  We have one point four million African-Americans. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=228.78s)]
*  And you just saw the AME bishops going even farther in saying that we ought to suspend [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  military all aid to Israel, military aid to Israel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  And then you've got three hundred seventy some thousand eighteen to twenty four year [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=240.74s)]
*  old voters, all of whom are very upset. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=244.46s)]
*  Now, there's these are somewhat overlapping groups, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  Right. But Eamon, Joe Biden won Michigan by one hundred fifty thousand votes in 2020. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=249.34s)]
*  We need these people to vote for Joe Biden on November 5th. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you need that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=259.7s)]
*  Got to get them. Yeah, you need you need that coalition. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=260.94s)]
*  And obviously, we're starting to feel the pressure. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=263.5s)]
*  I wanted to. And as I mentioned earlier, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, she has thrown [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=266.02s)]
*  her support behind a similar uncommitted effort in your state specifically for the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=270.14s)]
*  policies that you outlined with the war in Gaza. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=274.22s)]
*  But I want to play for you how some in the political class in the political world have [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=277.22s)]
*  reacted to her position. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=281.42s)]
*  Watch. And so Rashida Tlaib is not there to represent the squad. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=283.22s)]
*  She's not there to represent Palestine while there's merit and all those things. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=288.58s)]
*  You're there to represent your hometown constituency in the city of Detroit. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=291.7s)]
*  And I will tell all my friends and family in Detroit that your congresswoman has failed [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=295.3s)]
*  you and frankly embarrassed you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=298.94s)]
*  And there could potentially be ramifications. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=300.42s)]
*  If you want to see Donald Trump beat Joe Biden, then you have voices of Charlemagne and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=302.78s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib questioning Joe Biden's leadership, suggesting he's not fit for [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=306.74s)]
*  reelection. That's how you do it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=310.86s)]
*  Democrats beating themselves. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=312.53999999999996s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to respond to that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=314.7s)]
*  What do you make of those attacks on your former colleague and the thinking behind it [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=316.18s)]
*  from that analysis? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=320.46s)]
*  Well, first of all, I mean, I want to say that there aren't multiple efforts going on [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=323.02s)]
*  here, right? There's one really organic movement to get people to vote uncommitted [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=326.65999999999997s)]
*  that our revolution has endorsed and is participating in. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=332.06s)]
*  And Representative Tlaib is supporting as well. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=336.14000000000004s)]
*  Frankly, I don't care what a bunch of talking headed pundits say on MSNBC. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=340.74s)]
*  We're here on the ground in Michigan and they are dead wrong. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  Representative Tlaib is representing her constituents. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=352.3s)]
*  You know, a thousand black pastors in this country have written to the president saying [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=356.46s)]
*  we are super upset about this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=361.5s)]
*  So, you know, the idea that you either bring home the bacon or you work on human rights [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=363.97999999999996s)]
*  around the world is nonsense. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=370.7s)]
*  And Representative Tlaib is trying to do both. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=373.06s)]
*  We must do both. Joe Biden has done a good job on a lot of it, but we need him to change [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  course on this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=380.5s)]
*  We can't stand twenty eight thousand people being killed, women and children being killed [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=382.22s)]
*  at the fastest rate of any conflict since World War Two, the most journalists being [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=388.18s)]
*  killed in any conflict on record. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=393.3s)]
*  And, you know, all these facts, they go on and on and on. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=395.94s)]
*  Two thousand pound bombs provided by the U.S. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=399.46s)]
*  being dropped on places, according to The New York Times, where the IDF told civilians [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=402.66s)]
*  to run to. And then our military officials say we wouldn't use those bombs at all on [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  such a dense population. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=413.34s)]
*  We haven't done it in decades. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=414.78s)]
*  We didn't do it in Syria or Iraq when we were battling ISIS. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=416.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, people are super upset about this, Aiman. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  And I'm a I'm a union organizer and a community organizer more than a politician. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=422.86s)]
*  And I feel like we need to keep these people in the game. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=427.78s)]
*  So my message to people who are upset is don't go vote for my old colleague and friend, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=431.7s)]
*  Dean Phillips. Right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  Marianne Williamson's name still on there, although she's withdrawn, don't vote for them [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=437.42s)]
*  and don't stay home. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=441.9s)]
*  Don't stay home. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=443.58s)]
*  Come out and tell the president you're mad at him. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=445.46s)]
*  Aiman, there's eight months left or something like that till November 5th. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=448.26s)]
*  Let's send a message to the president that if you change course, which you must do [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=452.09999999999997s)]
*  for, you know, for for justice, then I think the people will return to him. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=458.02s)]
*  We have about a minute left, but I wanted to get your thoughts on part of the blame [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=464.06s)]
*  game here, because I spoke with Abdullah Hamoud, the mayor of Dearborn, about the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxYh2y-BRA&t=468.02s)]
