# RNC member scraps plan for resolution to declare Trump presumptive nominee
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A)
*  So far, Donald Trump has won 32 Republican delegates across two states. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=0.0s)]
*  He needs 1,215 more to secure the nomination. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=4.16s)]
*  So it was a little bit puzzling on Thursday when a Republican national committee member [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=8.0s)]
*  decided that was enough and adopted a resolution seeking to declare Trump the party's presidential [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=12.72s)]
*  nominee. The resolution proposed by RNC member and Trump ally David Bossie argued, quote, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=19.04s)]
*  All evidence negates the possibility of a mathematical path forward to the 2024 [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=25.12s)]
*  Republican nomination by any candidate other than President Trump, our presumptive nominee. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  The RNC rules say you need 50% plus one to clinch it. So here you have Republicans trying to deny [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  delegates the opportunity to be heard and cast a vote, in essence denying the democratic process, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=43.68s)]
*  something even Trump seemed to think was too much, writing on his social media site that the RNC [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=48.64s)]
*  should not go forward with the resolution. A source tells NBC News that it was withdrawn [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=54.56s)]
*  shortly after Trump made his post. Carlos Curbelo and Dino Valdella are back with me. Gentlemen, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=59.84s)]
*  Dino, I'll start with you. This actually comes out with you, your reaction to this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=66.48s)]
*  debacle from your former party. Oh, it's embarrassing, Aiman. And look, it's not [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  surprising. This is what the MAGA movement is all about, right? Changing the rules, ignoring [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=75.28s)]
*  the results, making exceptions if the person you agree with won or if you like them. And you had a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump ally basically saying, hey, we have this whole process. We have this elections calendar. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  People in states are preparing to vote, thinking about who they're going to vote for. Let's forget [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  about it. Let's just put the crown on Donald Trump's head. And I guess this was so bad that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  even Trump himself thought this might look bad, do him some damage. So he asked Mr. Bossy to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=109.68s)]
*  withdraw that resolution. But this is par for the course. This is how people who are a part of this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  movement think. They think that the rules don't apply to them and that as long as they get what [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  they want, that's all that matters. Dean, what does it say that Donald Trump is the one [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  rejecting the coronation, condemning the resolution and actually making the case that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=133.60000000000002s)]
*  people should decide? Look, Donald Trump posted on social media, Eamon, I'm reading from it, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=138.8s)]
*  we should do it the old-fashioned way and finish the process at the ballot box. This coming from [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=145.36s)]
*  a guy who attempted a coup, okay, after 2020, who incited the January 6 terrorist attack. And now he [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=149.68s)]
*  wants the old-fashioned way. Let's be honest. If he starts losing the delegate count to Nikki Haley, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=155.52s)]
*  he'll be the first to say, stop counting the ballots. It's over. This is rigged. And the worst [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  part is the MAGA part, not the normal GOP part. The MAGA part will be like, that's fine. That's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=164.8s)]
*  what we're dealing with. We're dealing with a guy who rejected doing debates in the GOP primary [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=171.12s)]
*  because that is a staple of democracy. Letting candidates, have a candidate on stage, let voters [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=175.52s)]
*  assess that. Trump said no to that. He will not debate Nikki Haley. And again, it's another [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  rejection of democracy. It's also Trump's handlers protecting him from what is clearly an honestly, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  dangerous cognitive decline of Donald Trump. So don't go on the debate stage. But look, this is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  just him playing games. He cares about democracy. That's hilarious. He should just say, live from [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=196.56s)]
*  New York on Saturday night at the end of it, because it's such a joke. The interesting thing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=201.04s)]
*  was, Congressman, that Nikki Haley came out against the resolution as expected. But she also suggested [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=204.56s)]
*  that it might have actually been Trump that was behind the plan. You think that might have been [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=209.2s)]
*  the case that Donald Trump maybe with a wink and not encouraged it, only then to kind of come out [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=213.28s)]
*  publicly and distance himself from it? That's certainly a possibility, Eamon. And it wouldn't [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=217.68s)]
*  be the first time that Trump had an idea that then he realized might actually hurt him and, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  you know, hit the brakes on it. But here's the sad part, Eamon. The sad part is that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=228.4s)]
*  if Donald Trump had actually requested this, it's very likely that the RNC would have gone along [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  with it and that they would have tried to cancel primaries in 48 states plus territories. So [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=240.24s)]
*  that is what people should take away from this, that in today's Republican Party, what one man [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=247.92s)]
*  says is the only thing that matters. And that's dangerous. That's not good for Republican primary [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  voters, but it is certainly not good for the country when we only have two major political [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=260.88s)]
*  parties. And the other thing is, like, let's pretend that, you know, let's not pretend that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=266.08s)]
*  this was just a one-off idea, because it came after RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel actually called [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=270.24s)]
*  on Haley to drop out and support Trump, leaving aside the fact that she, as the RNC chair, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=275.12s)]
*  is supposed to be impartial during this primary process. But do you think that, Dean, do you think [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=280.48s)]
*  that David Bossie felt like he had permission here because of the comments that were coming out [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=287.92s)]
*  from people like Ronna McDaniel? I'm surprised David Bossie didn't introduce a resolution saying [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=293.04s)]
*  Donald Trump should be named President of the United States today. I mean, look, we're dealing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  with a movement that honestly rejects democracy. MAGA, as President Biden has talked about, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=303.6s)]
*  is the greatest threat to our Democratic Republic that we've seen in our lifetimes, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=308.48s)]
*  the greatest threat to our Democratic Republic since World War II. So these are minor little [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=312.56s)]
*  things here around the edges. And the big picture, if you ask MAGA now, should Donald Trump be [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=317.04s)]
*  president today, they of course would say yes. If you ask Donald Trump that, of course he would say [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=322.0s)]
*  yes. So that's what we're dealing with, an anti-democratic movement, authoritarian in nature. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=326.0s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to be king. Why have election? Let's not be bothered by things like voting and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=330.64s)]
*  counting votes. Just give him a crown and let him be king. That's just, that's not how it works. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's it. Too bad. This is a Democratic Republic, Donald. Carlos, you know, Ronna McDaniel [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=340.0s)]
*  has had her hands in a lot of the Republican politics over the last several years, probably [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  not as visible as some of the others. But what do you think her legacy will be that she has been [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  the chair of the RNC during some incredible losses, but also with the rise of Donald Trump [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  and the rise of this anti-democratic movement that has taken a hold of the party? What do you [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=359.2s)]
*  think her legacy will be or stain would be on American politics when she's done? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=363.36s)]
*  Hey, man, I know the chairwoman. I truly believe that this cycle at the beginning, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=370.32s)]
*  she wanted it to be fair. She wanted it to be open. She wanted other candidates to compete. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=374.88s)]
*  But at the end of the day, people who are so closely associated with Donald Trump and with [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=380.96s)]
*  his actions are going to have to answer for them. And they're going to have to explain why they sat [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=386.64s)]
*  by while he diminished institutions, ignored the rule of law, tried to disrupt the constitutional [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=392.96s)]
*  order, diminished our public discourse, introduced all of this anger and hatred and resentment into [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=399.84s)]
*  our politics. So she's been right along there with him. And yes, Republicans haven't done [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=408.96s)]
*  very well the last few years. Again, big losses in 18 and 20, and then, of course, a big disappointment [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=416.32s)]
*  in 22. So it's all there, and she's going to have to answer for it one day. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think she's been cosigning a lot of Donald Trump's checks, especially the vitriol that he has, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=427.68s)]
*  as you said, injected into the politics. Just the tenor and the tone of how he has gone after other [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=433.2s)]
*  Republican candidates will be something that I think will be a hallmark of Republican politics [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=437.44s)]
*  for a very long time to come. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzBqC-MK_A&t=441.84s)]
