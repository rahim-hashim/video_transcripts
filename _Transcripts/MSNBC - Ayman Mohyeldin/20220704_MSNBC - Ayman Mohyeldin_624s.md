# The Threat To Abortion Access In Purple States
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A)
*  Joining us now are former Congresswoman Kendra Horne of Oklahoma. She is running for U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=0.0s)]
*  Senate now, and Emily Wales, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Great Plains. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=7.12s)]
*  Ladies, thank you so much for joining me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman, I would like to start with you. How dangerous is the situation for women [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=14.64s)]
*  in these swing states if Republicans win the governor races? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=18.84s)]
*  EMILY WALES, Former U.S. President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Great Plains, Oklahoma, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=22.48s)]
*  Congresswoman, I would like to start with you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=23.48s)]
*  How dangerous is the situation for women in these swing states if Republicans win the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=24.48s)]
*  governor races? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=25.48s)]
*  Thank you, Mary. Thank you, everybody here this evening. What we're talking about is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=26.96s)]
*  a life-threatening situation for women in Oklahoma and the trigger states, where we [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=29.92s)]
*  are already living. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=35.3s)]
*  Myself and all women in Oklahoma have lost the right to make our own health and reproductive [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=36.8s)]
*  decisions with bills that are nothing more than government overreach, plain and simple, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=42.08s)]
*  that putting women's lives at risk is front and center on the ballot this year. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=47.6s)]
*  The unfortunate reality is, in places like Oklahoma, and I know this all too well, that, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=54.8s)]
*  for such a long time, writing off whole sections of our country and allowing this continued [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=60.76s)]
*  build with laws like Oklahoma, which bans, Oklahoma's law, which bans abortion at fertilization, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=68.8s)]
*  it provides no exceptions for health of the mother. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=77.08s)]
*  This is government overreach, and it's wrong. And if we do not take action and invest and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=80.76s)]
*  do the work in Oklahoma and in the states where these laws are coming out, and if we [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  don't all show up and make sure that there is a long-term investment, we are all going [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  to pay the price. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=95.78s)]
*  The truth is that the majority of women, the majority of people in Oklahoma and across [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=97.0s)]
*  this country don't support these extreme abortion bans, including we have polling from April [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=101.88s)]
*  before this came out that showed 56% of people in Oklahoma would vote against somebody that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  supports this. But we have to take action now, and especially in states like Oklahoma. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Emily, your state of Oklahoma is one of the several red states that have banned abortion, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  excluding cases of incest and rape. What are the logistics right now of having access to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=127.12s)]
*  abortion in Oklahoma? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=132.08s)]
*  We've really been living a nightmare in Oklahoma. We had seen prior to the most recent bans [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=135.56s)]
*  taking effect in Oklahoma, we've been seeing Texans crossing state lines to get care in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=140.6s)]
*  Oklahoma who were living nightmares. They were telling us about how terrible it was [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  that they needed care, that they had fewer rights. And despite seeing that, the Oklahoma [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=149.64s)]
*  legislature moved forward with bans that actually put Oklahoma in a position before a rule even [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=153.64s)]
*  fell to lose care. Prior to last week's ruling, we had already lost access in Oklahoma because [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  we had the first of the country's total bans on abortion care. So what it means now, if [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=165.72s)]
*  you're in Oklahoma or Arkansas or Missouri, three of the four states we serve, we have [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=171.2s)]
*  to tell you, you have fewer rights than you did a week ago, you have fewer rights than [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=175.6s)]
*  you do in neighboring states, and you are going to have to get out of this state to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=179.52s)]
*  get care. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  The other state that we serve, Kansas, is actually in an incredibly unique position. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=184.56s)]
*  On August 2nd, Kansans will be the first state in the country to vote on a constitutional [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=188.72s)]
*  protection for abortion. They actually have access in Kansas today, and they get to see [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=193.28s)]
*  the reality of what's happening around them. They see the government interference, the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=198.56s)]
*  bans on care, and they can do something to push back. And it's really the playbook other [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=202.76s)]
*  states are going to have to use. You're going to have to fight back at the state level to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=206.92s)]
*  get protections you deserve. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=211.2s)]
*  Congresswoman, you know, the troubling trend right now, and we saw this a little bit with [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  Clarence Thomas' opinion, it's not just abortion rights. In fact, several of the GOP gubernatorial [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  candidates in Michigan indicated this week that they'd support banning same-sex marriage [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  as well. Let's play this for our viewers. Watch. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=229.48s)]
*  I believe that the federal government needs, the Supreme Court needs to start rolling back [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=231.88s)]
*  a lot of those things and give the power back to the states where it belongs. The Michigan [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  Constitution defines a marriage between one man and one woman. And that is my belief also. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=241.56s)]
*  Article 1, Section 25 of our constitution, Michigan Constitution, says that for the betterment [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=248.08s)]
*  of society, marriage is between a man and a woman. I draw the line where God does, and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  that's where I stand. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=258.96s)]
*  Your reaction to that, Congresswoman? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=262.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's not surprising. And I think we have to, at this moment, call this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  what it is. This is extremism. It's government overreach. It's incredibly dangerous. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=272.48s)]
*  Look, what we are talking about right now is an effort by a certain group of people [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  that has been a long-term effort to divide us and to strip away rights. And it starts [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=283.32s)]
*  at the state level. Emily is right. We have got to stop this at the state and local level. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=290.36s)]
*  This government overreach, this erosion of rights, it has been made very clear. They're [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  not just stopping at women. So we have to remember that we're all in this together. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=302.72s)]
*  And I have to say, as an Oklahoman, and when I was elected to Congress in 18, I'm the only [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  Democratic woman ever to have served in the United States House of Representatives from [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=311.0s)]
*  the state of Oklahoma. When I'm elected in November, I'll be the first woman ever to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=316.16s)]
*  represent the state in the U.S. Senate. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=320.36s)]
*  And the bottom line and the message, because in places like Oklahoma, where we've been [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=323.56s)]
*  written off and used as an example of what not to do, and these wedges that the extremists [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  are driving between us, people give up. And when we give up on ourselves and when we're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=335.12s)]
*  used as an example of what not to do and writing people off, running out of the state, it only [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=342.91999999999996s)]
*  continues to harm people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=348.2s)]
*  In Oklahoma right now, we are fourth in the nation for deaths of pregnant women and mothers. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=349.96s)]
*  We're fifth in the nation in infant mortality. We have one of the highest rates of childhood [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=356.52s)]
*  poverty. These things that the extremists want that are pushing us apart and injuring [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  women and stripping away our rights are just the first step. But we have to ask ourselves [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=369.76000000000005s)]
*  how we got here, and we have to understand there are no quick fixes. But it's about showing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=374.88s)]
*  up. It's about reaching out and saying to people, regardless of their political affiliation, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  if they are concerned by this, we have to show up and vote against people like that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  Emily, what will this mean for women having to travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  What's the option right now for women in Oklahoma, even if neighboring states are not able to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  provide access, as we heard from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Elson, they want to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=403.4s)]
*  try to provide it for those who are in North Dakota? Oklahoma might be geographically a [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=407.12s)]
*  little bit more difficult. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=411.32s)]
*  The reality is that many of our patients are not able to figure out the logistics to get [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=414.08s)]
*  care. There are some patients who are going to New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois. But for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=418.12s)]
*  many of the patients we serve, it is an incredible barrier to say you're going to have to miss [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=423.4s)]
*  multiple days of work, you're going to have to figure out child care. Of course, our patients, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=427.28s)]
*  even though it is legal to cross state lines, they feel like their actions are criminalized. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  So they're telling us, I think my partner or my parent would be supportive, but I'm [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  not going to tell anyone because I don't want to get them in trouble. So many of our patients, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=439.79999999999995s)]
*  if they can travel, they are going alone and they're scared. And if they can't travel, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=444.28s)]
*  they're trying to figure out how to terminate a pregnancy without medical support, which [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  should never happen in a civilized society, or they are forced to carry a pregnancy against [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=452.4s)]
*  their will. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  I have a final question to the both of you, Congresswoman. I'd like to start with you, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=459.8s)]
*  your message to women all over the country who are rightfully terrified about these bans [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=463.24s)]
*  taking place as you run for Congress. Excuse me for Senate. Yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=468.68s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. My message is simple, that banning abortion, without exception, and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=472.92s)]
*  pulling back the rights of women is wrong. It's government overreach, plain and simple, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=480.24s)]
*  that we are in unprecedented times right now. And we have to come together and we have to do the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=484.88s)]
*  work to make people in our communities understand why it is so important in Oklahoma and across [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=490.88s)]
*  this country. The bottom line is this. These things, these trends, these dangerous bills [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=497.12s)]
*  start with extremists in places like Oklahoma, but they have not won. We have seen our rights [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=505.28s)]
*  rolled back, but they have not won yet. They have only won if we don't show up. So to all those [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=512.32s)]
*  that ask if it's even possible to change things, it absolutely is, but only if we show up. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=518.08s)]
*  We need to help each other and we need to support candidates like myself who are committed to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=523.36s)]
*  standing up and fighting for women and fighting for people who the extremists are coming after [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=528.96s)]
*  to strip away their rights. Right now, our choice is not between Democrats versus Republicans, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=535.44s)]
*  but the bottom line is it's about extremists that want to tear us apart and problem solvers [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=541.52s)]
*  like myself that want to protect all of our communities and lift us up. And we have to work [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=546.72s)]
*  together and start from the ground up. Emily, your final thoughts on that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=552.24s)]
*  My message to patients right now who are struggling to figure out what to do, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApvISjd8q9A&t=559.4399999999999s)]
