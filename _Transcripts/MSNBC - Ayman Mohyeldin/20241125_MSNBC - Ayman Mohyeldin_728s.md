Video Description: NBC News has been reporting on how Donald Trump has declined to sign an ethics agreement that would force him to disclose who is funding his transition, in exchange for federal matching funds. Now, the New York Times explains that by refusing to sign, Trump's team is raising untraceable sums of money from unknown sources, both domestic and foreign. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin spoke to Seneca Project CEO Tara Setmayer and former Obama campaign adviser Ameshia Cross about the open corruption at play and how nothing the Trump team is doing will help the working-class voters that helped elect him.

# White House for sale? Trump's transition team reportedly running on 'secret money'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0)
*  As the vote count from election night continues to be tabulated, Donald Trump has now slipped [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=0.0s)]
*  below 50 percent of the vote. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=4.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=7.88s)]
*  The latest count shows his victory was by one of the smallest margins since the 19th [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=8.88s)]
*  century. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=14.44s)]
*  One thing it was not, a landslide. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=15.44s)]
*  With inflation and economic insecurity considered key reasons behind why the incumbent party [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=17.76s)]
*  lost and with many working-class Americans turning to Republicans and Donald Trump, how [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=22.52s)]
*  is he looking to meet the needs to the American working class? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=28.28s)]
*  By handing his administration over to the highest bidder, of course, the Trump transition [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=33.28s)]
*  team is now running on secret donations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=37.92s)]
*  NBC News has been reporting on how Trump's team has declined to sign an ethics agreement [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  that would force them to disclose who is funding this transition in exchange for federal matching [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=45.56s)]
*  funds. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=51.24s)]
*  Now, The New York Times explains that by refusing to sign, Trump's team is raising untraceable [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=52.24s)]
*  sums of money from unknown sources, domestic and foreign. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=57.64s)]
*  This of course raises the obvious possibility of a pay-to-play and blatant corruption, which [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=62.24s)]
*  while extremely alarming, should come as no surprise for this incoming administration. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=67.76s)]
*  Look, we already know that five days before Trump's first inauguration in 2017, a secret [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=72.84s)]
*  $10 million withdrawal was requested from the state-run National Bank of Egypt, money [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  that US intelligence believe may have ended up in the hands of Donald Trump. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=85.16s)]
*  This investigation was shut down by Trump's then Attorney General Bill Barr. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  And the president-elect went on to have a very chummy relationship with Egyptian President [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  Sisi, even calling him his quote, favorite dictator. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=97.0s)]
*  That was far from the only sign of corruption during Trump's tenure in the White House. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  The watchdog group, CRU, found more than 3,400 conflicts of interest during Trump's first [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=105.32s)]
*  term, from holding events at his properties and golf courses and lining his pockets to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=110.12s)]
*  foreign officials patronizing Trump-owned businesses, possibly in exchange for political [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=115.28s)]
*  favors. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=120.28s)]
*  And during his most recent presidential campaign, we learned Trump invited oil CEOs to Mar-a-Lago [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=121.4s)]
*  and promised to hand over his energy policy to them if they could steer $1 billion to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=126.4s)]
*  his campaign. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=131.96s)]
*  This is on top of the more than $100 million a piece he received from three billionaire [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  mega-donors, Timothy Mellon, Miriam Adelson and Elon Musk, who appears to be co-running, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=138.84s)]
*  if you will, Trump's administration and transition. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  Make no mistake about it, this is not an administration that is being built to address the needs of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=148.96s)]
*  the working class voters who elected it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  It appears to be a smash-and-grab operation and an auctioning off of the presidency for [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=156.02s)]
*  profit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=161.84s)]
*  The question's ahead, of course. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=163.36s)]
*  How much are they going to get away with and who is going to stop it? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=165.02s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this and more, Tara Sattmeyer, co-founder and CEO of the Seneca [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=169.34s)]
*  Project. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=173.18s)]
*  She's also a former GOP communications director and Amicia Cross, Democratic strategist and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=174.18s)]
*  a former Obama campaign advisor. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=178.34s)]
*  Ladies, it's great to have both of you with us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=180.34s)]
*  Tara, surprise, surprise, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  No one can say that they did not expect this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=183.94s)]
*  It hasn't even been a month, I guess, since the election, and here we are already seeing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=187.18s)]
*  some shadiness. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=191.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's make America corrupt again. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump has been doing this for his entire political career, all the way back [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=196.06s)]
*  to when we were talking about him and his dealings with Russia. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=202.62s)]
*  But throughout his entire presidency, there was a lot of shady business deals going on, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  cabinet members included. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=213.34s)]
*  His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who got billions of dollars from the Saudis as a result of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  his coziness to the president and his work inside the White House. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=220.82s)]
*  I mean, it's outrageous. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=225.9s)]
*  And we've been distracted with so many other things, outrageous and unethical things that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=228.18s)]
*  Donald Trump has done, from the sexual impropriety and misconduct to his cabinet members with [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=232.66s)]
*  these problems, that we've kind of forgotten about this corruption side of things, the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  unethical side. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=244.22s)]
*  Just last weekend, Donald Trump was sitting ringside at the UFC fight with the head of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=245.78s)]
*  the Saudi Public Investment Fund. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=250.34s)]
*  So I mean, it's pretty obvious. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=252.70000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk isn't hanging around because he wants to just be cool and be part of the presidential [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=254.74s)]
*  transition team. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=259.54s)]
*  Elon Musk has a lot invested in this here, literally and figuratively. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=260.54s)]
*  So any time that you see this, the people that Donald Trump is surrounding himself with, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=265.42s)]
*  I ask the American people, how do you think this is going to benefit you in the middle [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=270.18s)]
*  class? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  How do you think any of these relationships are actually going to benefit you and fix [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  the affordability issue that so many people claim that that's the reason why they voted [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=279.74s)]
*  for Donald Trump? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=284.18s)]
*  They forgot about everything else. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=285.7s)]
*  They rationalized everything else, all the other problems. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=287.1s)]
*  But it's because Donald Trump is going to fix the economy for us. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  Is he? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=292.62s)]
*  Is it really going to be for them or is it going to be for him and his rich friends? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=293.62s)]
*  Yeah, Misha, I mean, basically the sign on the White House is going to read open for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=296.58s)]
*  business or for sale one way or the other. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=300.54s)]
*  I mean, for all the talk after the election about working class votes shifting Republican, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=303.34s)]
*  isn't this going to create a wide opening for Democrats? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=310.41999999999996s)]
*  Shouldn't it create a wide opening for Democrats to combat Trump and the Republicans? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=313.14s)]
*  I mean, clearly these appointments and these donors are not here to fight for working men [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=316.73999999999995s)]
*  and women in America. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=321.46s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=323.05999999999995s)]
*  The working class voter, that vote was up for grabs and unfortunately the Democrats [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=325.14s)]
*  lost on that front. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=328.7s)]
*  With that being said, nothing about Donald Trump up to and including the president shows [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=330.1s)]
*  that he ever really cared about working class voters or those who are not in the top five [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=333.62s)]
*  or one percent. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=338.98s)]
*  What we see now and can acknowledge very full throatedly is that this is a guy who does [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=340.14s)]
*  not want to release specific donor names or where this money came from because with those [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  monies comes ties to things that he doesn't want the American public to know about. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=348.98s)]
*  With that money comes ties to and a tacit promise to do the bidding of those individuals [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=353.46s)]
*  and those foreign entities as well. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=358.42s)]
*  I think that there is a reason why Ivanka Trump as well as Jared Kushner are no longer [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=360.14000000000004s)]
*  a part of anything having to do with the Trump campaign or the incoming Trump administration. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=365.34000000000003s)]
*  They got their money and they ran with it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=369.62s)]
*  Donald Trump is a businessman, a failed one, yes, multiple times bankrupt, but a businessman. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=371.42s)]
*  At the end of the day, the man is not going to do anything that does not turn a dime and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=376.18s)]
*  he's appointing people in positions who also are willing to turn that dime and sell us [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=380.02000000000004s)]
*  out to the highest bidder. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=383.62s)]
*  That is what Donald Trump is known for. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=385.1s)]
*  It is not building the working class. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  This guy does not support of union workers. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=388.3s)]
*  By and large, even in his own business, he was known for firing people instead of extending [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=390.3s)]
*  opportunities for them to work overtime. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=395.74s)]
*  This is a guy who has never supported union workers. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=397.74s)]
*  This is a guy who does not have a record of supporting the working class. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=400.06s)]
*  And regardless of how much he turned himself into a shape-shifter in terms of messaging, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=402.9s)]
*  this is a guy who will not support the working class. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=407.06s)]
*  What we are going to see is him sell America its secrets and its opportunity off to whoever [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=409.46s)]
*  affords him the most money to do so. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=413.74s)]
*  That is not your everyday American voter. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=416.02s)]
*  Tara, it's not just corruption, it seems, because as The Times has noted, the transition [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=417.86s)]
*  team, since they have failed to sign a separate agreement with the Justice Department, the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=423.98s)]
*  FBI is unable to conduct background checks needed to grant these incoming appointees [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=429.09999999999997s)]
*  security clearance. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=434.82s)]
*  And as a result, the transition is reportedly using private firms to vet candidates, leaving [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=435.82s)]
*  open the possibility that federal law enforcement may never properly review Trump appointees. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=441.14s)]
*  I mean, if you've been wondering about the questionable vetting of some of these cabinet [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=448.34s)]
*  picks, this might be the reason why. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=453.26s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=458.26s)]
*  And this is, I think, something I'm glad it's being reported on now, because this is something [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  that, again, that is so highly unusual. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=464.06s)]
*  During the transition, there's a lot that goes on during transitions that people don't [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=467.7s)]
*  see because it's supposed to be a smooth transition. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=471.34s)]
*  They start this like six months before the inauguration so that the American people really [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=473.82s)]
*  don't feel any difference in handing power from one to the other. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=478.14s)]
*  We saw that was exposed the ugly underbelly of what happens when you try to thwart the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=482.53999999999996s)]
*  peaceful transfer of power back in 2020. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=487.09999999999997s)]
*  But this time, because Donald Trump won, there's no nothing about the election being fraudulent, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=490.2s)]
*  but what they're doing this time around, and this is why it's so much more nefarious than [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=496.22s)]
*  before, because these guys actually know what they're doing now, and they've had four years [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=501.22s)]
*  to figure it out. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=504.62s)]
*  By not letting the FBI do these background checks, it doesn't have, you don't have a [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=506.0s)]
*  public record exposing all of the problems. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=510.26s)]
*  The last time we had problems with the SF86 form, I think it is, where you have to fill [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=514.02s)]
*  out your financial disclosures and things, and Jared Kushner had to edit it like 100 [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=519.34s)]
*  times or something. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=524.26s)]
*  That was the biggest scandal before. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=525.26s)]
*  This time, they're not signing over anything. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=527.3s)]
*  They haven't, the GSA can't transfer things over. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=530.5s)]
*  They can't use money with the funding to help with the offices and the computers and the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  basic logistics of handing things over to a new administration. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=538.8199999999999s)]
*  They can't do any of that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=542.7399999999999s)]
*  And then on top of it, you have all of these cabinet members who would normally be vetted [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=543.9399999999999s)]
*  by the FBI that are not being vetted now because Donald Trump doesn't want this exposed. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=548.5799999999999s)]
*  Look at how many people have problems, whether it's with their own personal behavior or with [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=554.24s)]
*  their finances or questionable lawsuits and who they're doing business with. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  If the FBI does this, then that's exposed. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=563.9599999999999s)]
*  There's public record of that, and then senators have access to it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=567.04s)]
*  How many people do we know with this mass deportation? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=570.1999999999999s)]
*  How many of the private prison magnates are lining Donald Trump's pockets so that they're [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=572.88s)]
*  ready to go when it's time to set up the camps, when they round people up? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  There's so many examples of Donald Trump turning this into his own personal fiefdom with all [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=582.04s)]
*  of these people around him that it should be alarming to the American people. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=587.28s)]
*  But you know, sunlight is the best disinfected, and that's why they don't want us to have [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  any of it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=594.76s)]
*  Well, we do have one more thing to add to the list, Demetra, about the grift, and that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=595.76s)]
*  is coming soon from a conservative publishing house co-founded by none other than Donald [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=599.56s)]
*  Trump Jr. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=604.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's upcoming book, Save America, is on sale for a mere $99, $499 for signed [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=606.84s)]
*  copies, apparently already sold out. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=615.48s)]
*  This, according to a Trump social media post, captures the magic we had and will soon have [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=618.4s)]
*  again. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=624.94s)]
*  I mean, from gold shoes to fake playing cards to, you know, the Bible— [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=625.94s)]
*  Trump water. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=632.0400000000001s)]
*  Trump watches. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  Trump watches. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=634.0400000000001s)]
*  Fake Rolex. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  It just keeps coming. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=636.24s)]
*  This is a guy who is known as a marketer-in-chief. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=637.76s)]
*  This is a guy who is known for trying to flip and remix democracy in his own image. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  This is a guy who believes that, you know, the structure of our democracy is fundamentally [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=644.5s)]
*  unhinged and he does not support any of the systems that become of it and wants to eradicate [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=648.52s)]
*  it as we know it, in addition to, you know, shaping our constitution in a very different [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=653.0799999999999s)]
*  format than it was originally intended. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=657.8399999999999s)]
*  So I'm not necessarily surprised that this book is coming out or that his son has, you [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=659.62s)]
*  know, tactically pushed it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  The imagery in and of itself, Donald Trump, unfortunately, there were multiple assassination [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=665.56s)]
*  attempts. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=669.84s)]
*  He took that one in Pennsylvania to have a shot seen around the world. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=670.84s)]
*  When it comes to the fist pump, he knew what he was doing when he was doing it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=675.6s)]
*  And at this point, I just think that he's going to try to bank off of that for years [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=679.0799999999999s)]
*  to come. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=682.42s)]
*  I wonder if he's actually paying any royalties to the photographer who took that picture [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=683.42s)]
*  with the sale of those books. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=688.52s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=690.12s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=691.12s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=692.12s)]
*  I mean, it's definitely not a picture that he can pretend that he doesn't know was taken [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=693.72s)]
*  by somebody else, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=697.24s)]
*  An actual professional photographer. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=698.52s)]
*  Tara, Misha, stick around. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=700.16s)]
*  What's that? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=701.88s)]
*  I said, like, that matters to Donald Trump. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=702.88s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=704.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=705.8s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=706.8s)]
*  The rules don't apply. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCz2mJCBX0&t=707.8s)]
