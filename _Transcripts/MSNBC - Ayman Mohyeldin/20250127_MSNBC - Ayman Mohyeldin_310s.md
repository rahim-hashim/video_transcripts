Video Description: In one week, Elon Musk campaigned for Germany’s extremist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigration AFD Party, urged Germany to “move beyond” Holocaust education, and appeared to do a fascist-style salute at a Trump inauguration party, which he denied. With Holocaust Remembrance Day approaching, MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin discussed what we can learn from these controversies, the importance of confronting antisemitism, and the need for solidarity among all marginalized groups.

# MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin on Elon Musk and the importance of confronting antisemitism
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo)
*  Monday is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=0.0s)]
*  Since 2005, the U.N. and its member states have held commemoration ceremonies to mark [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=3.36s)]
*  the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau and to honor the six million Jewish victims [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=8.36s)]
*  of the Holocaust and millions of other victims of Nazism. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=14.68s)]
*  One person who won't be doing any commemorating, it seems, is Elon Musk. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=18.84s)]
*  Yesterday, Donald Trump's top donor, who will reportedly be getting an office in the White [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  House complex, addressed Germany's far-right AfD party, a party known for its anti-Semitic, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=27.34s)]
*  anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-democratic beliefs. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=34.38s)]
*  Take a look at what Musk had to say about German history. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=39.06s)]
*  I think there's, like, frankly, too much of a focus on past guilt, and we need to move [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=42.34s)]
*  beyond that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=48.46s)]
*  People, you know, children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents or even let alone [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=50.46s)]
*  their parents, their great-grandparents, maybe even. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=56.26s)]
*  Musk also warned the crowd about the dangers of multiculturalism, and he followed it up [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  a speaker who championed the idea of remigration, a term popularized by a neo-Nazi which calls [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=65.1s)]
*  for forcibly removing immigrants who refuse to integrate with German culture regardless [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=72.08s)]
*  of their citizenship status. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=77.66s)]
*  The timing and context of Musk's appearance there is quite important. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=79.68s)]
*  It's not just that the German far-right that wants to prevent people from learning about [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=84.38s)]
*  their history—just consider Trump's executive orders this week, a huge part of the rights [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  war on DEI and critical race theory—are not just attempts to prevent women and people [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=93.02s)]
*  of color from employment and education opportunities in favor of white men. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=98.3s)]
*  It is also meant to prevent Americans from learning about their history, just like Elon [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  Musk said in Germany. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  One of the executive orders has forced the Air Force to stop using training videos about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=110.82s)]
*  the Tuskegee Airmen, America's first black military pilots who served in a segregated [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  World War II unit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=121.13999999999999s)]
*  They also need to stop teaching about the Women Air Force Service Pilots, or WASPs, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=122.8s)]
*  the female World War II pilots who were vital in ferrying warplanes for the military. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=127.33999999999999s)]
*  Musk's appearance also came a few days after his so-called Roman salute controversy, where [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=133.5s)]
*  Musk may or may not have done a Nazi seahail. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=139.14s)]
*  I have no idea what he was doing or what his intentions are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=143.61999999999998s)]
*  He defended himself on X, saying his opponents needed better dirty tricks and that everyone [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=147.98s)]
*  is a Hitler attack is so tired. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=152.7s)]
*  Look, we know he is a troll, but we also know he has been campaigning for the closest thing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  Germany currently has and had to the Nazi Party in this century. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=161.92s)]
*  And we also know that right-wing extremists celebrated Musk's gesture, again, whatever [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  that was. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  Perhaps most importantly, we know that Musk has regularly trafficked in anti-Semitic posts [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=174.1s)]
*  online, including the claim that Jewish people are pushing hatred against whites, which was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=178.98s)]
*  the dangerous theory believed by the man who committed the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=184.17999999999998s)]
*  massacre back in 2018. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  So when you look at Musk's track record, many people were taken back, specifically [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=192.1s)]
*  when the Anti-Defamation League actually defended Musk after the salute controversy, saying, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=197.34s)]
*  hey, it wasn't a Nazi salute and that we should all give him a bit of grace. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=202.38s)]
*  That was followed up by Benjamin Netanyahu taking to X, saying that Elon Musk is being [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=208.26s)]
*  falsely smeared and that Elon is a great friend of Israel, as if that somehow absolves him [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=215.18s)]
*  from charges of bigotry. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=222.58s)]
*  After Netanyahu's post, Yehuda Shal, the co-founder of the Israeli veterans organization, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=224.84s)]
*  Break the Silence, posted and said it this, like this, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=229.34s)]
*  We'll defend you against accusations of anti-Semitism, even if you do the Nazi salute. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=245.18s)]
*  Now I should note that after the ADL was criticized for defending Musk, Musk then followed up [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=252.58s)]
*  by posting Nazi jokes on his ex-account, which then prompted the ADL to finally criticize Musk. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=257.46000000000004s)]
*  Look, this is a dangerous time in America for all minority groups who feel threatened [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=265.58s)]
*  by this newly empowered Naga movement. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=270.94s)]
*  With its new supporters in corporate America, big tech and big media, and January 6th riders [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=274.16s)]
*  being part of it, Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, solidarity with all groups under threat is [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=279.94s)]
*  more important than ever, as well as remembering our own history. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDAOoxurVo&t=284.9s)]
