Video Description: Elon Musk once warned that Kamala Harris would be a "puppet president." Now, Musk has overshadowed President-Elect Donald Trump to the point that Democrats are jokingly calling him President Musk... and a new report claims that behind the scenes, Trump is annoyed about it. MSNBC legal analyst Charles Coleman Jr. spoke with Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) on the dangers of Musk's influence over Trump and what Democrats can to do push back against it.

# Rep. Jasmine Crockett says hopefully it's 'cutting season' for Trump-Musk
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ)
*  In the closing weeks of the election, billionaire Elon Musk had this to say about a potential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris presidency. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=5.88s)]
*  Well, not the Kamala puppet, I call him. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  The machine that the Kamala puppet represents. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=11.88s)]
*  It's bad to attack Kamala because it's just a puppet. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=14.68s)]
*  There's no point in attacking a puppet. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=17.2s)]
*  Attacking a puppet, the puppet master. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=21.92s)]
*  A puppet to who exactly? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=24.68s)]
*  I'm not even really sure that Musk even really knows, but now it's become clear that he's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=27.2s)]
*  found his own puppet in President Donald Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=33.0s)]
*  The ex-owner travels with Trump all over the world, joining meetings with foreign leaders. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=36.8s)]
*  He's with Trump so much that he's reportedly taken up residence in a cottage at Trump's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=41.6s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago Resort in Florida. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  And in a jaw-dropping show of power, it was Musk, not Trump, who brought the country to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=49.16s)]
*  the brink of a government shutdown. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=54.0s)]
*  Now, a new report everyone saw coming is alleging that the former star of The Apprentice is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=56.12s)]
*  getting a little tired of Musk's omnipresence and all of the media attention that he's been [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=62.72s)]
*  stealing from him lately. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=68.16s)]
*  A Trump insider who worked on the 2024 campaign told MediaEight that, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=69.92s)]
*  100%, Trump is annoyed. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  There's a Chinese saying, two tigers cannot live on one mountaintop. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=76.44s)]
*  Now, even if the original tiger is getting tired of the new one overshadowing him, he's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=80.96s)]
*  not showing any signs, at least publicly, that he's ready to break up this bromance. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  Here was Donald Trump recently dismissing all of those President Musk allegations. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=90.36s)]
*  He's not taking the presidency. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  That's not happening. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=105.8s)]
*  He's not going to be president, that I can tell you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=107.16s)]
*  And I'm safe, you know why? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=110.88s)]
*  He can't be. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  He wasn't born in this country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Nothing like some healthy xenophobia to make the record clear. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=119.56s)]
*  And over the holidays, when Musk got caught up in a nasty MAGA civil war over his support [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=123.64s)]
*  of H-1B visas, it was Trump who stepped in and sided with Musk over his former White [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=128.68s)]
*  House Chief of Staff, Steve Bannon. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=133.8s)]
*  But Trump may be in over his head here, and it could all come down to the over $250 million [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=136.68s)]
*  that Elon Musk poured into Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=144.52s)]
*  That's about 250 million puppet strings. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=147.72s)]
*  But that's a lot of money to someone who's reportedly spent over $100 million in legal [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  fees since 2021, but just a drop in the bucket to the richest man in the world. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=156.32s)]
*  Yale historian Timothy Snyder told The Guardian, Trump is a little guy and Musk is a big guy [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=161.96s)]
*  when it actually comes to money. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think if you were a friend of Trump, you would be worried. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=168.52s)]
*  This has all been one big gift to Democrats who've been doing some soul searching of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=172.2s)]
*  their own after losing working class voters to Donald Trump in 2024 and struggling to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=176.72s)]
*  rebrand. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=182.48s)]
*  But now they can say no one voted to send this billionaire to the White House. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=183.76s)]
*  But there he is pulling all of the strings, exerting control over Republicans and influencing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=188.68s)]
*  policy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=194.0s)]
*  The puppet master. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=195.0s)]
*  I should note that these are all AI generated images that we are playing for you right now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=197.4s)]
*  But are they really like are they really that far from reality? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=202.2s)]
*  Joining me now to start the second hour is Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=208.36s)]
*  of Texas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=212.4s)]
*  Congresswoman, good to see you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=213.4s)]
*  Let's just start with your reaction to the fact that there seems to be trouble in paradise [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=216.32s)]
*  between this bromance with Donald Trump and Elon Musk and how you think that may play [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  out? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, hopefully it's cutting season instead of cuffing season for these two. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, listen, I think that Donald absolutely wants to cut the strings, but he really doesn't [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=235.44s)]
*  know how. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is a guy who has always decided that he wanted to surround himself with people [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  that had money and or power. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=246.6s)]
*  And right now, all he cares about is money. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=248.52s)]
*  Listen, for those that felt like he was going to be their savior and be the guy that was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=250.72s)]
*  look out looking out for the middle class. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=255.4s)]
*  He has never been middle class. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=257.24s)]
*  And so he's not looking out for them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=258.8s)]
*  We know that he is filling his cabinet or at least attempting to fill his cabinet with [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=260.12s)]
*  other people that are very wealthy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  He is looking out for his future and what that will look like. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=266.6s)]
*  And so that's why it is difficult for him to cut the strings, because he needs Elon [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=270.24s)]
*  cutting season versus cuffing season. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=275.32s)]
*  That is quite poetic. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  It's kind of hard to go someone who put $250 million in your campaign. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't know how that happens, leaving somebody on red like that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=283.44s)]
*  But in a serious note, Congresswoman, there is a real threat of conflicts of interest [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=287.32s)]
*  and national security threats that Elon Musk poses being that close to the president running [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=296.48s)]
*  the Office of Government Efficiency and then also having as many tentacles throughout [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=304.44s)]
*  government with respect to the merger of private industry and where he sits. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=309.48s)]
*  What are Democrats doing to stay on top of that and make sure that these potential conflicts [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=314.32s)]
*  of interest do not threaten the American people? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=321.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's sad to say, but I think the threat is already here. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=325.92s)]
*  I don't think that this is a matter of if, but a matter of when. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=330.56s)]
*  And it is one of the reasons that I am attempting to continue my service on the Oversight Committee, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=333.8s)]
*  because it is going to be really important that in that committee, even if our chairman [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=338.92s)]
*  Comer does not want to have very real conversations about these threats that are being presented [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=343.32000000000005s)]
*  for all American people because of the conflicts of interest that Elon has, you know, one of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  the things that people did not talk about a lot in that continuing resolution that Elon [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  blew up, part of it was really about him. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=358.6s)]
*  It had nothing to do with additional monies being shelled out anywhere. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=360.76000000000005s)]
*  It had everything to do with disallowing him from engaging in some of the investments that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=364.56s)]
*  we believe that he is trying to do as it relates to China. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=370.16s)]
*  We know that we have seen continual aggression coming from China. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=373.8s)]
*  We know that Russia is not necessarily our best friend, regardless of the fact that Trump [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=378.0s)]
*  doesn't recognize this. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=383.56s)]
*  And so with him sitting in these rooms, with him not necessarily being put into a position [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=385.16s)]
*  where he has to be Senate-confirmed, with him being able to actually basically puppeteer [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=389.72s)]
*  the incoming president and having his own individual interests, whether we're talking [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=395.44000000000005s)]
*  about the contracts that he's looking for, those defense contracts, you know, those federal [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  dollars—I'm sure those are not the ones that he's going to seek to cut. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=404.8s)]
*  We really need to make sure that we are highlighting this for the American people and doing everything [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  that we can, even if it means that we've got to go to Trump's Supreme Court and try [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  to get them to do what they are supposed to do, which is to follow precedents and follow [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=416.12s)]
*  the law and follow the Constitution. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=420.68s)]
*  I want to play a portion of an interview that aired today with my colleagues on the weekend [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=421.68s)]
*  and retired Lieutenant General Russell Honoré, who was making the case as to why Musk is [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=428.20000000000005s)]
*  in fact a national security risk, particularly with respect to ties in China. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=434.36s)]
*  We'll talk on the other side of this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=438.6s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  This might be the only time I agree with Steve Bannon. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  He is questioned, must be influenced in his capability and his connection with the foreign [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=445.72s)]
*  leaders, must have conversations with Chinese president, with the Russian president. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=453.24s)]
*  He's got an enormous amount of influence. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=459.92s)]
*  I guess that's what come with being the richest man in the world. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=461.76000000000005s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=466.72s)]
*  Is, in fact, Elon Musk, or should he be seen as a national security risk? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=467.72s)]
*  He absolutely should be. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's been laid out. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=476.32s)]
*  But this isn't a matter of really Americans deciding that they're going to stand up [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=477.32s)]
*  and say something, right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  We know that when it comes to MAGA and when it comes to Trump, they believe that they [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  have a mandate. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=486.32s)]
*  But exactly what that mandate is, I don't know, because, you know, he has made it clear [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=487.58s)]
*  that he's like, well, I don't know if I can really get the cost of food down. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=491.56s)]
*  Well, I can tell you that his base needs to be loud about the fact that they want to be [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=495.2s)]
*  safe in this country. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=501.02s)]
*  And I need people not to take it for granted that we do have oceans on the east and the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=502.76s)]
*  west coast of us that are actually helpful to us. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  It's water that helps us. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=511.0s)]
*  But with, you know, Musk and Trump talking about Canada and talking about Mexico and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=512.72s)]
*  talking about expanding the United States, while also palling around with the likes of [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=519.14s)]
*  Putin, who obviously, in my opinion, has been in violation of so many international laws [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  when it comes to deciding that he was going to go into Ukraine and how he has conducted [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=531.62s)]
*  himself in this war. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=535.9s)]
*  I mean, it seems like we're living in the upside down, and we need some real adults [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=537.14s)]
*  in the room. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  And right now, I don't see that he has picked any to surround himself with that will talk [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=542.9s)]
*  about the fact that this is not The Apprentice. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=547.62s)]
*  This is not a TV show. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=550.6999999999999s)]
*  This is real life. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=551.98s)]
*  And real Americans are relying on him to step up to the plate and actually be the president [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=553.2199999999999s)]
*  of the United States and not be a guy that is going to submit himself to the likes of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=557.58s)]
*  Xi Jinping. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=562.9000000000001s)]
*  All right, Congressman, every time that we talk, I feel like I'm asking you what Democrats [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=563.9000000000001s)]
*  are about to do. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=569.5400000000001s)]
*  You are no longer a freshman member anymore. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=570.5400000000001s)]
*  You survived one of the least productive sessions of Congress ever. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=573.1800000000001s)]
*  What is the strategy that Democrats have going forward? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=578.9000000000001s)]
*  Because I don't know that pointing across the aisle and saying that our Republican colleagues [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=582.42s)]
*  can't get it done is going to be enough. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=588.54s)]
*  Well, definitely, that's part of the strategy. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=591.18s)]
*  I mean, yes, this was the most unproductive Congress that we had in the hundred and eighteenth [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=594.9799999999999s)]
*  Congress, but we were talking about the fact that we at least still had the presidency [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=600.38s)]
*  and we had the Senate. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=603.78s)]
*  Well, right now it is a Trump trifecta. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=604.78s)]
*  And if y'all really believe that y'all have a mandate, well, guess what? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=607.06s)]
*  Technically, you don't need the Democrats. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=609.98s)]
*  You can get it all done amongst yourselves. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=611.8199999999999s)]
*  So I absolutely plan to sit back and watch them try to figure things out by themselves. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=614.14s)]
*  Now, we know, at least on the House side, that they have always been unable to do this. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=619.54s)]
*  We know that they have a similar majority. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=623.5799999999999s)]
*  But the longer that we can stand together and say, no, no, no, this is your problem, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=625.74s)]
*  because we are not going to be the ones that are going to be on the front lines of trying [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=630.22s)]
*  to inflict the very same pain that we campaigned against, whether we're talking about getting [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=633.54s)]
*  rid of Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, all of the things that they have talked about. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=638.3000000000001s)]
*  We just heard Hakeem Jeffries on yesterday talk about the fact that these are not entitlements. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=642.1800000000001s)]
*  These are literally benefits that people have worked and earned. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=646.4200000000001s)]
*  And so, no, we will stand up for the American people at all times and we will make sure [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=650.1s)]
*  that we are making it clear. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=655.26s)]
*  I think that it's going to be important that we have a real rapid response team when [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=656.26s)]
*  it comes to communications. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=659.94s)]
*  We cannot allow their lives to sit around and fester and grow because in that void, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=661.1800000000001s)]
*  it ends up becoming truth. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=666.5400000000001s)]
*  And honestly, our silence is complicit. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=668.2199999999999s)]
*  And so we've got to make sure that we're speaking up, speaking out. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=671.3s)]
*  And then, of course, you're going to hopefully have me sitting on oversight and judiciary [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=673.9399999999999s)]
*  in real time calling out their lies and making sure that we are not only doing this in committee, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=678.0999999999999s)]
*  but we're doing it on podcasts. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=683.5799999999999s)]
*  We're doing this on radio morning shows. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=684.9799999999999s)]
*  We're doing this on the traditional spaces such as MSNBC and other networks. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=687.3s)]
*  But also for those that are okay with going on those other ones that I don't talk to, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=691.9399999999999s)]
*  we're going to have to reach out to there because we are going to have to do more than [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=696.42s)]
*  just preach to the choir. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=699.54s)]
*  But we are going to have to educate folk that seemingly think that they don't see the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=700.6999999999999s)]
*  world the same as we do. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=704.42s)]
*  But we're going to have to let them know that we are their real champions. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=705.74s)]
*  Congressman, I've got about 30 seconds left. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=708.2199999999999s)]
*  How much pressure do you think is on Democrats to really make it clear what Republicans aren't [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=711.18s)]
*  doing as we go into this new session of Congress? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=717.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=721.8599999999999s)]
*  I feel more pressure now than I did in the 118th because at the end of the day, we have [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=724.0600000000001s)]
*  midterms that are coming up in two years. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=729.4200000000001s)]
*  And we are so close at taking the House. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  There is only going to be a two-seat majority in a few days, whereas 217 to 215. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=733.74s)]
*  And so we really need to take the House. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=738.78s)]
*  And so we can do that in two years and hopefully really start to thwart this terrible Project [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=741.22s)]
*  2025 agenda. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=747.78s)]
*  So it's going to mean everything. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=748.78s)]
*  So we're going to get in there and we're going to work hard. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-amWpMVHhkQ&t=750.58s)]
