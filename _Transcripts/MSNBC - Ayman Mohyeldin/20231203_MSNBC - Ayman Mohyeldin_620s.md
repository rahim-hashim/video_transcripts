# Ayman: Trump's explosive rhetoric is ‘getting more dangerous all the time’
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic)
*  It seems like Donald Trump just can't stop, or perhaps won't. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's language on the campaign trail is getting more dangerous all the time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=6.84s)]
*  And as we have documented on this show regularly, his supporters take his words to heart. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=11.4s)]
*  Here's just a small taste of the vitriol that the disgraced ex-president has been spewing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=17.56s)]
*  lately to his supporters. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  This is a sick nest of people that needs to be cleaned out immediately. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=25.04s)]
*  Get them out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  Very simply, if you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=32.76s)]
*  store. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=39.56s)]
*  Shot! [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=41.04s)]
*  We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=43.8s)]
*  left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=51.36s)]
*  Now, as the ball works, Jill Lawrence puts it, Trump's rallies have become, quote, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=56.68s)]
*  tutorials in hate, vulgarity, and disrespect. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=61.68s)]
*  Lawrence dubbed the former president the worst role model in the history of American politics, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=65.48s)]
*  and his rhetoric offers chilling previews of what dangers could lie ahead in a second [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  Trump term. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=75.92s)]
*  In a recent interview with Univision, the former president suggested that should he [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=76.92s)]
*  win a second term, he would use the FBI and the Justice Department to go after his opponents, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=80.78s)]
*  saying in part, quote, If I happen to be president and I see somebody who's doing well and beating [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=86.22s)]
*  me very badly, I say, go down and indict them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=91.38s)]
*  They'd be out of business. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=95.22s)]
*  They'd be out of the election. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=96.62s)]
*  Now, there's always or also that Bombshell Washington Post reporting from earlier this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=98.26s)]
*  month all about Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act on day one of his second [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=102.9s)]
*  term, which would allow him to deploy the military against civil demonstrations. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=108.5s)]
*  Autocracy experts have long sounded the alarm over Trump's praise for foreign dictators [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=113.22s)]
*  and his bitter disdain for Democrat democratic ideals right here at home. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=117.30000000000001s)]
*  But now they say the former president's increasingly intensive focus on his perceived internal [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=123.42s)]
*  enemies has actually put him even more in line with other dangerous totalitarian leaders. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=128.78s)]
*  Just take a look here at two people who have had to bear the brunt of Trump's attacks [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  in recent weeks. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=139.22s)]
*  The New York judge presiding over Trump's civil fraud case and his law clerk. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=140.89999999999998s)]
*  A recent filing detailing what court officials described as a, quote, deluge of threats targeting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=145.42s)]
*  the pair include hundreds of threatening and harassing voicemail messages. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=150.78s)]
*  Those messages came directly after Trump repeatedly posted about the judge and the clerk on his [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=155.42s)]
*  failed social media site. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=160.6s)]
*  And despite this, Trump hasn't slowed down, hasn't rolled back any of his criticisms. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=162.74s)]
*  In fact, he's only continued them in recent days, doubling down on his insults against [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=168.22s)]
*  the pair and now even going after the judge's wife on social media. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=172.9s)]
*  Here's how friend of the show and authoritarian expert Ruth Ben-Giag describe Trump's overall [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  strategy, an obvious one of dehumanizing people so that the public will not have as much of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=183.22s)]
*  an outcry at the things that you want to do. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=189.7s)]
*  And let's remember that is the real issue here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=194.22s)]
*  The action that could come from Trump's words are real. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=197.1s)]
*  A recent poll found that 33% of Republicans agree with this following statement. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save the country. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=206.33999999999997s)]
*  And that is up five points from 2021. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=212.78s)]
*  Robert Pape, who studies political violence at the University of Chicago, told Roll Call, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=216.46s)]
*  he worries those numbers could forecast danger on the horizon in 2024. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  Quote, the water looks calm on the surface, but there's turbulence just under the water [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=225.86s)]
*  line and anymore. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=230.74s)]
*  It doesn't take much to set it off. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=232.66s)]
*  Where we are heading is a Tinder box. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=235.3s)]
*  Here to discuss this with me is Fernando Amande, Democratic pollster and MSNBC political analyst. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=239.34s)]
*  Paola Ramos, an Emmy award-winning journalist and MSNBC contributor, and Carol Lam, a former [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=244.3s)]
*  federal prosecutor and MSNBC legal analyst. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=248.62s)]
*  It's great to have all three of you with us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=251.66000000000003s)]
*  Paola, I'll start with you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail getting uglier, more threatening, more vulgar. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  Has it always been like this, or do you see it now crossing a new threshold? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=261.82s)]
*  It's always been like this, and it's just getting worse. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=268.02s)]
*  And I've seen this play out for them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=270.02s)]
*  I've seen this play out on the ground for the last five years. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=272.58s)]
*  I've seen the way that those words have really fundamentally transformed a segment of the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=274.9s)]
*  population, radicalized them completely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=280.02s)]
*  The last five years, I've seen pastors that have become Christian nationalists. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=282.62s)]
*  I've seen men that have turned into anti-trans crusaders. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=287.14s)]
*  I've seen immigrants turn into border vigilantes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=290.58s)]
*  I've talked to many moms that have turned into groups like Moms for Liberty. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=293.34s)]
*  To Ruth's point, it's because these words have the capacity to do something extremely [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=298.90000000000003s)]
*  dangerous, which is this ability to dehumanize others. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=302.86s)]
*  Perhaps aiming the difference is that in 2016, Trumpism was all about dehumanizing immigrants. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=306.18s)]
*  It was about treating immigrants as the enemy for everyone. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=312.54s)]
*  And now Trumpism is about dehumanizing absolutely everyone that is against him and that is against [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=317.3s)]
*  democracy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=323.54s)]
*  And I think that's the fundamental problem that we're up against. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=324.54s)]
*  It's understandable that we're at a point where political violence is normalized. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=327.26s)]
*  If you look at the FBI data, you understand that also hate crimes are on the rise. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=330.94s)]
*  And again, it's because we're seeing this fusion of the hate with the rhetoric. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  And the question is, what's the next step? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=340.02s)]
*  We saw January 6th. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=342.94s)]
*  How much are people willing to go for Donald Trump? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=344.58s)]
*  And that's a really scary question to pose and to take seriously. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=347.58s)]
*  Fernandez, I want to get your reaction to what the former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=350.9s)]
*  had to say about Trump's recent behavior. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=356.5s)]
*  He told the New York Times, quote, it is too simplistic to reference him as a neo-fascist [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  or autocrat or whatever. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=363.5s)]
*  Trump is Trump, and he has no particular philosophy that I've seen after four years as president. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=365.86s)]
*  And I'm not really sure how to process that, whether he's downplaying Trump or saying [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=371.14s)]
*  he's singularly unique and that he's being able to encompass all of these threats under [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=375.02s)]
*  his own vision of totalitarianism. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=379.86s)]
*  That is, as Paola was suggesting, a form of Trumpism. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=381.98s)]
*  But what do you make of these comments? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  And do you agree that Trump is in a league of his own here? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=387.94s)]
*  Well, first, shame on Chuck Hagel for those normalizing of the abnormal comments. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=392.58s)]
*  It is exactly that type of poo-pooing of what we are all seeing and hearing and feeling [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  in our guts, in our bones and between our ears about what is happening. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=404.14s)]
*  We are in a four alarm fire moment for American democracy, Aiman, because in six weeks or [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=408.62s)]
*  less than six weeks, voters are going to start voting in these early states. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=414.41999999999996s)]
*  If Donald Trump wins Iowa and New Hampshire, right now, the polls show he's going to win [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=419.9s)]
*  both of those states comfortably. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=424.58s)]
*  No one is really mounting a serious challenge to his standing in those two states. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=426.46s)]
*  He's going to be the Republican nominee for president. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=431.14s)]
*  And the difference between a Donald Trump's second administration versus the first Trump [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=434.42s)]
*  administration, and this is why Hagel's comments are even more irresponsible and shameful, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=439.74s)]
*  are because Donald Trump has learned the lessons of what guardrails existed in the first [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=444.42s)]
*  term. If he goes in in the second term with this rhetoric that is seed planting fascism, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=449.26s)]
*  he's planting the seeds now in an environment that he knows he won't be able to enforce. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=455.1s)]
*  But if God forbid he manages to regain power, it will be a different moment. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=459.22s)]
*  He will then be able to weaponize those words into action. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=463.78000000000003s)]
*  And it is going to be without the guardrails of the first administration, because none of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=466.74s)]
*  those who stood up and worked within the Trump administration to at least slow that down [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=471.94s)]
*  will be around the next time. We're in a very dangerous moment. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=476.5s)]
*  That's why words like Hagel's cannot be tolerated. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  All of us who love this country and this democracy need to call this out for what it is, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=483.1s)]
*  a fascist movement to end our American democracy led by Donald Trump. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=487.86s)]
*  Carol, as I mentioned a few moments ago, Trump has reportedly threatened to invoke the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=492.53999999999996s)]
*  Insurrection Act against protesters should he retake the White House. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=497.09999999999997s)]
*  And to Fernand's point, he's he's learned where the guardrails are. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=500.5s)]
*  So a second Trump presidency will give him a better chance of manipulating them or [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=504.41999999999996s)]
*  outright blasting through those guardrails. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=508.06s)]
*  And that is a good example of it, because that act, which was crafted in our nation's [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=510.82s)]
*  infancy, actually allows the president to call on reserve or active duty military [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=514.86s)]
*  units to respond to unrest in the states. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=519.86s)]
*  And it's an authority that is not reviewable by the courts. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=522.3000000000001s)]
*  So when we go back to guardrails, are there any guardrails in place to prevent the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=527.14s)]
*  exploitation of that act from being used if Trump is reelected? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=532.14s)]
*  Well, as you noted, Amon, there are not many guardrails. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=537.9s)]
*  The the Insurrection Act sort of stands in tension with or it's an exception to the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=541.42s)]
*  Posse Comitados Act, which says that you can't use federal military forces to deal [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=546.66s)]
*  with civilian unrest. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=553.4599999999999s)]
*  And that that's what most people think. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=554.86s)]
*  But the Insurrection Act is an exception to that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=557.42s)]
*  And there have been calls that this one hundred and fifty year old statute really needs to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=560.62s)]
*  revisited and it needs to be tightened up because it came to pass in a time when our [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=565.5799999999999s)]
*  nation was very different. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=571.8199999999999s)]
*  It's not this kind of nation now. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  And the the Donald Trump has indicated his willingness to see when and how he can use [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=576.26s)]
*  that to put down any unrest that he may cause because of his views about institutions [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=583.3399999999999s)]
*  that underlie our democracy. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  So it is a very, very dangerous situation. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQC_k5O_ic&t=591.9399999999999s)]
