# The cost of the Big Lie: Giuliani ordered to pay damages to Georgia election workers
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ)
*  A few weeks ago, we shared the stories of Ruby Freeman and Shane Moss, and tonight we [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  have an update on the mother-daughter election worker duo who were terrorized by Donald Trump [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=6.66s)]
*  and his allies after the election. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=11.52s)]
*  That campaign of harassment, notably led by former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=14.0s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani, centered around a conspiracy theory that Freeman and Moss somehow illegally [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=17.84s)]
*  suitcases full of fake ballots to an Atlanta area vote counting center. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=25.5s)]
*  It lies at the center of some of the criminal charges that have been brought against Giuliani [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=30.42s)]
*  and other co-defendants in Fallon County, Fonny Willis' racketeering case. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=34.22s)]
*  But long before these charges, Freeman and Moss took matters into their own hands by [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=39.3s)]
*  suing the former mayor in federal court for civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=43.7s)]
*  emotional distress, and defamation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=48.66s)]
*  On Wednesday, almost two years after their reputations were dragged through the mud in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=51.739999999999995s)]
*  service of a desperate ex-president, Freeman and Moss finally witnessed some accountability. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=56.82s)]
*  When U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell found the former mayor liable for defaming Freeman [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=64.94s)]
*  and Moss in a scathing 57-page ruling, Judge Howell said Giuliani had failed to comply [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=69.22s)]
*  with discovery obligations, forcing her to issue what's called a default judgment against [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=75.58s)]
*  him. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=81.54s)]
*  Judge Howell accused Giuliani of, quote, donning a cloak of victimization and undermining the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  discovery process in what should have been, by any measure, a, quote, straightforward [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=87.4s)]
*  case. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=92.54s)]
*  Howell blasted Giuliani for only giving, quote, lip service to compliance with her obligations [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=93.54s)]
*  and court orders. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=97.9s)]
*  She then ordered him to pay Freeman and Moss punitive damages, and we're going to learn [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=99.34s)]
*  just how much Giuliani will have to pay up in the next few months. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=103.54s)]
*  Howell has set a trial to determine that amount, scheduled for later this year, or perhaps [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=108.06s)]
*  even early next year. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=113.66s)]
*  And that number could be as high as several million dollars. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=114.86s)]
*  And that's not welcome news, though, for a beleaguered Trump co-defendant with ongoing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=118.54s)]
*  financial struggles. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=122.14s)]
*  Giuliani already owes around $90,000 in sanctions to Freeman and Moss. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=123.62s)]
*  That is in addition to more than $40,000 in legal fees. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=128.44s)]
*  He also owes more than $300,000 to a document hosting company. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=132.5s)]
*  His finances will no doubt continue to suffer as he battles that new indictment in Fulton [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=136.98s)]
*  County. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=141.26s)]
*  And it appears Giuliani is already hurting financially because last month he put his [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=142.26s)]
*  three-bedroom, multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment on the market. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  So it seems the former mayor may have finally learned his lesson. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=150.33999999999997s)]
*  Tell the truth, because lies can cost you everything. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=154.94s)]
*  . [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwOchaIXWQ&t=166.98s)]
