# Rep. Raskin on indictment of GOP star impeachment witness: 'It's time to fold up the circus'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U)
*  Joining me now is Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, ranking member of the House Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=0.0s)]
*  on Oversight and Accountability. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=4.72s)]
*  Congressman Raskin, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=5.72s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming back on the show. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=8.16s)]
*  Give me your thoughts about this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  I mean, is there any rationale, any justification for House Republicans to continue their impeachment [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  inquiry after the developments of this week? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=16.76s)]
*  Is this now dead? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=19.28s)]
*  No, it's time to fold up the circus. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=21.28s)]
*  And of course, it's all not just based on this explosive finding, but on a whole series [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=26.040000000000003s)]
*  of similar findings. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  I mean, we got a letter from Rudy Giuliani's right-hand man, Lev Parnas, who basically [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=33.92s)]
*  said he was sent out to try to find dirt like this, and there was nothing there, and he [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=39.44s)]
*  has never seen anything to substantiate those original false allegations that have now just [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  been established or presumably established by the FBI. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=51.56s)]
*  We saw it from Gordon Sondland, who testified in the first impeachment hearing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=56.24s)]
*  We heard it from the former president of Ukraine, Poroshenko. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  The Republican senators who investigated this in 2020 came back totally empty-handed [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  and said there was nothing there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=70.16s)]
*  So I'm afraid that our friends really should just fold up shop and say they acted in good [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=72.08s)]
*  faith. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=78.68s)]
*  I would be willing to grant them a pass on that one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  But it's over, and we should stop wasting the taxpayers' money and stop wasting energy [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=83.0s)]
*  on this when there are so many other serious matters to be conducting oversight over with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=87.34s)]
*  respect to the government or with respect to the country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=92.66000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we look at this terrible epidemic of gun violence taking place in the country. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  That's something we should be studying to see if we can do something about that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=100.2s)]
*  So there are lots of things that I think would rightfully call upon our attention legislatively, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=106.48s)]
*  but this one is over, and I called on them Friday just to acknowledge their defeat. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=111.74s)]
*  I was going to say, you're a better man than me for giving them that much credit that they [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=118.46s)]
*  were acting in good faith. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=123.64s)]
*  I mean, I think for most people, this was a political sideshow from the very get-go. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=124.98s)]
*  And the truth is, Congressman, and we should remind our viewers that this epic embarrassment [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=129.7s)]
*  is hardly a first for your colleague, James Comer, because throughout this process, he [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=134.1s)]
*  has repeatedly presented so-called smoking guns only to have them blow up in his face. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=138.44s)]
*  Even some of his own, as you just mentioned, Republican colleagues even know that this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=143.22s)]
*  isn't going anywhere. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=147.08s)]
*  What are you hearing from the Republicans on your committee and more widely on the Hill [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  if they are ready to move on? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=153.84s)]
*  Well, they're embarrassed and mortified that every single lead or every asserted explosive [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=156.54s)]
*  bombshell witness, every breakthrough tip ended up completely meaningless. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=165.66s)]
*  And now we know why. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=174.28s)]
*  It all started with a tissue of lies and falsifications and fictions. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=175.38s)]
*  It's right there in the FBI indictment. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=180.34s)]
*  And they're not even at this point pretending to object to the indictment, which was obtained [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=183.10000000000002s)]
*  by U.S. Attorney Special Counsel Weiss, who, of course, was a Donald Trump appointee. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=188.58s)]
*  So, you know, acknowledging my own agnosticism about whether or not they were acting in good [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=196.06s)]
*  faith or bad faith, Comer could just say, well, we were acting in good faith, but it's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=202.74s)]
*  all over now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=206.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=207.5s)]
*  And they can move on to do the people's business, but I don't know that he's got it within him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=208.98s)]
*  I mean, now they're starting to pretend as if this were not the central allegation of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=214.58s)]
*  the whole wild goose chase. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=220.94s)]
*  But of course it was. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=222.34s)]
*  This was how it started and it should end here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=223.5s)]
*  I wanted to pivot for a moment, Congressman, and get your thoughts on Judge Ingoar's ruling [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=225.74s)]
*  in Donald Trump's New York civil fraud case, certainly as somebody like yourself who has [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=229.78s)]
*  investigated Trump, albeit for different alleged crimes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=233.46s)]
*  What did you make of the $350 million price tag for the former president's persistent [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  asset inflation? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=242.14s)]
*  Do you believe this is what accountability looks like? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=243.7s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=246.54s)]
*  And for me, it's such a stark contrast to the propaganda and the disinformation and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  the constant promises of evidence and facts and all of these things which never materialize. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=255.33999999999997s)]
*  What we have now in a series of civil court rulings, like the E. Jean Carroll case, and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=260.88s)]
*  also now this one in the civil fraud case in New York, is the rule of law at work and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  the courts actually examining real evidence, arriving at real facts and applying the law [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  to the facts. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=279.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's not gone well for Donald Trump, who's now is, by my reckoning, more than a half [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  billion dollars in the whole, just in legal debts that he's incurred by violating the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  law in obvious ways that anybody would understand and certainly a professional businessman would [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=294.98s)]
*  understand you can't do. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=301.1s)]
*  You can't inflate the value of your properties for some purposes and deflate them the exact [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=303.1s)]
*  same properties for other purposes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=309.78s)]
*  You can't sexually assault people in department stores and then defame them about it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=312.34s)]
*  These are basic rules of legal conduct that apply to everybody in society. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  And it's an astonishing ruling by the judge in the New York case because he basically [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=326.85999999999996s)]
*  says that there's absolutely no contrition, no remorse and no acceptance of responsibility [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=332.85999999999996s)]
*  for blatant violations of his civil duties. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=339.29999999999995s)]
*  And the question is whether this pattern in the civil cases will now be able to carry [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=343.46s)]
*  over in criminal court, assuming that the Supreme Court does the right thing and finds [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  that a president is or a former president is not absolutely immune from criminal process [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  for crimes committed while he was president or afterwards. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=361.61999999999995s)]
*  So let me ask you about that, because you just brought it up really quickly. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  What are you watching for as the Supreme Court weighs in on this Trump immunity claim? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=369.58s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm not too optimistic, I'm afraid to say, about the Colorado case. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=376.54s)]
*  I went to the Supreme Court and watched very carefully the oral arguments and I was disappointed [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  to come away with the sense that the justices entered the courtroom with their minds made [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=388.98s)]
*  up. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=394.70000000000005s)]
*  I think they clearly did not want to implement and enforce the clear meaning of Section 3 [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  of the 14th Amendment. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=401.58000000000004s)]
*  But it did trigger in me at least the suggestion, well, maybe there's an implicit kind of arrangement [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=403.82s)]
*  where they're going to allow Trump to go on the ballot despite the explicit prohibition [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=410.1s)]
*  of allowing people to be president who've engaged in insurrection or rebellion if they'd [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=416.98s)]
*  once sworn an oath of loyalty to the Constitution, but that they might find he can be on the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=421.94s)]
*  But of course we're going to reject, as the D.C. Circuit Court did, this absolute categorical [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=428.94s)]
*  claim that presidents are somehow immune from criminal liability, finding that the president [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=436.06s)]
*  really is above the law. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=442.94s)]
*  And I would hope that that would be a unanimous ruling. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=444.9s)]
*  The D.C. Circuit Court decision is just splendid and sweeping in saying this is a direct attack [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=447.14s)]
*  on the Constitution and the rule of law as it's been understood for more than two centuries. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=454.94s)]
*  Yeah, very thorough and written explanation decision at the time when it came out. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=459.54s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, it's always a pleasure, sir. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=463.54s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time for us. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=465.7s)]
*  I greatly appreciate your insights. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvCuBPmS9U&t=467.38s)]
