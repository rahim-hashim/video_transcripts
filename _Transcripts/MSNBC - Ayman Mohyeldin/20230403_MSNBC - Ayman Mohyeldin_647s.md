# Michael Cohen's lawyer calls Southern District of New York’s conduct “abusive”
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA)
*  Tonight, we have a much deeper sense of the legal peril facing Donald Trump and the reason [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=0.0s)]
*  it has taken so long to get to this moment, thanks to a pair of stunning new revelations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=11.88s)]
*  Breaking earlier today, Lanny Davis, Michael Cohen's attorney, who we're going to speak [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=17.8s)]
*  to in just a few moments, confirmed to Axios that his client provided Manhattan prosecutors [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  with documentation about a Trump hush money payment made to a second woman who claims [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=27.76s)]
*  to have had a past affair with him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=33.2s)]
*  Now that suggests the case by district attorney Alvin Bragg could actually be broader than [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=35.28s)]
*  the Stormy Daniels payment. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=40.24s)]
*  Also breaking, former Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance, pressed about why Trump wasn't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  charged earlier in this hush money case, told MSNBC today that he was asked to stand down [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=47.08s)]
*  by his then bosses. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=52.96s)]
*  We're looking at the so-called hush money payment issue and then we learned from the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=56.64s)]
*  Southern District of New York that they asked us to stand down. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=62.72s)]
*  And by stand down, I mean they were communicating that they had this ongoing investigation and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=66.68s)]
*  they wished that we put our efforts on hold while they completed their investigation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=71.08s)]
*  And I felt that was appropriate for me to press the pause button. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=78.36s)]
*  And so for the course of probably more than a year and a half, that's what we did. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=83.08s)]
*  I was surprised after Michael Cohen pleaded guilty that the investigation from the Southern [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=86.76s)]
*  District on that issue did not go forward. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=91.72s)]
*  So this request, this request to stand down came under the Trump Justice Department. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  And to be clear here, we don't know exactly why or what caused the Southern District of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=103.22s)]
*  New York to not take any action. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=107.36s)]
*  And we have no direct evidence that there was political interference in the case. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=109.84s)]
*  But here's what we do know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=114.12s)]
*  We know from the public record that Donald Trump has a pension for attempting to interfere [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=115.52s)]
*  in investigations that pose a threat to him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=120.2s)]
*  We also know that Trump has a pension for putting pressure on the Southern District [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=123.02s)]
*  of New York. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  After all, Trump's first Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, fired then U.S. Attorney General [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=129.28s)]
*  Preet Bharara from his role overseeing the Southern District after he refused a request [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=133.8s)]
*  to resign. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=139.72s)]
*  And months later, Bharara said he believed that if he had stayed, Donald Trump would [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=140.96s)]
*  have asked him, quote, to do something inappropriate. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=146.82000000000002s)]
*  And years later, the Trump appointee to oversee the Southern District of New York, Jeffrey [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=150.4s)]
*  Berman, released a book. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=154.28s)]
*  And in that book, he alleged that Trump sought to use the U.S. Attorney's Office to support [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=156.28s)]
*  Trump politically and pursue his critics, even pushing the office to open a criminal [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=161.62s)]
*  investigation of former Secretary of State John Kerry. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=166.9s)]
*  So while we can't totally connect the dots, maybe you, the audience, can. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=170.5s)]
*  A short time ago, I spoke about these developments and a whole lot more with Michael Cohen's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  attorney Lanny Davis. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  Lanny Davis, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  This morning, former Manhattan DA Cy Vance revealed to NBC News that he was told to, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=186.28s)]
*  quote, stand down on the Trump hush money investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=191.14s)]
*  in the Southern District. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  Vance went on to say that after Michael Cohen pleaded guilty, he was somewhat surprised [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=198.54s)]
*  that the federal government did not proceed on the areas in which it had asked him to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=203.54s)]
*  stand down. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=208.77999999999997s)]
*  What is your reaction to that revelation? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=209.77999999999997s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  Well, first of all, the Southern District could not prosecute a sitting president under [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  the Justice Department's policy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=217.54s)]
*  But they did some very strange things that I believe an inspector general of the Justice [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=219.73999999999998s)]
*  Department should consider looking into. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=224.14s)]
*  For example, Jeffrey Berman, the former U.S. attorney, said that the attorney general of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=226.18s)]
*  the United States, I think the assumption would be that Mr. Trump directed him to do [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=230.34s)]
*  this or knew he was doing it, called Jeffrey Berman and asked for a reversal of the Michael [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=235.26s)]
*  Cohen guilty plea. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  There are other things I could mention that are quite problematical as to the conduct [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=241.73999999999998s)]
*  of the Southern District, including abusing Mr. Cohen on a Friday afternoon telling his [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=246.94s)]
*  lawyer if he doesn't plead guilty to all these counts, including not even having a chance [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=251.62s)]
*  to look at the tax issues by Monday morning. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=256.42s)]
*  So from Friday afternoon when things are shut down to Monday morning, if you don't plead [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=259.82s)]
*  guilty now, we're going to indict you on Monday morning, including your wife. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=264.66s)]
*  There's something abusive about that that I at least raise a question that should be [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=269.86s)]
*  looked into by the inspector general of the Justice Department. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=274.98s)]
*  And you've also revealed, Lanny, that your client Michael Cohen had provided Manhattan [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=277.98s)]
*  prosecutors with documents related to hush money payments made to a second woman who [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=282.5s)]
*  claims to have had an affair with Donald Trump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=287.54s)]
*  Can you tell us who is that woman and what are the potential implications for Alvin Bragg's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=290.7s)]
*  case if there are two women and multiple hush money payments at its center? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=295.14s)]
*  Well, again, trying to be very careful about what I can or can't comment on, it is a matter [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=301.34s)]
*  of public record that the Southern District prosecutors under Donald Trump stated in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=305.9s)]
*  writing that Trump directed Michael Cohen to pay the hush money payments. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=311.46s)]
*  And then they call that a serious crime, impairing our democracy in so many words. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=316.78s)]
*  So what I can tell you is that Michael was forced to plead to a second crime involving [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=323.1s)]
*  Karen McDougall, even though he did not pay any money in that situation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=328.42s)]
*  That money exchange occurred between the National Enquirer and Karen McDougall to keep [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=332.86s)]
*  her quiet before the election. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=338.54s)]
*  Mr. Trump was involved in that understanding that he would repay the National Enquirer [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=340.18s)]
*  that one hundred and fifty thousand. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=345.58000000000004s)]
*  Now, Michael did get accused of papering that transaction, but he pled guilty to that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=347.54s)]
*  transaction. So that's the best answer. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=353.86s)]
*  I can tell you that that transaction involving Karen McDougall is the second crime. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=356.06s)]
*  And there are witnesses to that crime that are not just Michael Cohen and corroborating [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=361.38s)]
*  detailed documentation to that crime as well. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=367.1s)]
*  As I mentioned and others have described Michael Cohen as the star witness of this case, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=371.14s)]
*  you certainly know the ins and outs better than almost anyone. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=375.42s)]
*  How would you respond to some of the criticism that this is a potentially weak indictment [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=378.66s)]
*  that involves a quote unquote untested legal theory that might be politically motivated? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=384.18s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me deal with the weakness on facts that's completely speculated [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=390.42s)]
*  by people who don't know a thing. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=396.26s)]
*  I'm in the room all the time for many meetings, at least seven with this particular group [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=398.38s)]
*  of prosecutors. And I've talked to Michael countless hours. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=403.82s)]
*  I know what the facts are in the case, and it's substantiated by documents, emails, text [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=407.38s)]
*  messages, telephone calls. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=412.82s)]
*  It's a very strong factual case coming down to one question to the jury. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=414.42s)]
*  Was Donald Trump motivated in any way by politics when he directed Michael Cohen to pay [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=418.74s)]
*  the one hundred and thirty thousand dollars and not connected to him right before the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=424.86s)]
*  election with a promise to be repaid? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=428.7s)]
*  And he did repay them while he was president of the United States from his personal [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=431.06s)]
*  checking account. So that is the question for the jury to decide. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=434.46s)]
*  They'll have to decide whether Michael Cohen's testimony that there was a discussion [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  about the political ramifications and right before the election within one or two weeks, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=443.06s)]
*  Mr. Trump directed directed, according to federal prosecutors, not according to Michael [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  Cohen, directed Michael Cohen to pay the money. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=452.46s)]
*  It's a pretty strong case factually on the law. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=455.62s)]
*  I can only say that there are different statutes in New York that seem to be applicable. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=458.14s)]
*  And I can assure you that the D.A. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=463.22s)]
*  and the prosecutors have studied this question and do not believe the judge will dismiss [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=465.66s)]
*  the case without allowing the jury to decide the basic facts based on the law. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=470.34s)]
*  You've said that Michael Cohen would be a key witness in the Trump trial. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=475.06s)]
*  How do you plan to balance the obvious knowledge that he has with the notion that Cohen [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=479.06s)]
*  has lied before and that the Trump team and certainly Trump's lawyers will aim to paint [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  him as a liar? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=490.06s)]
*  So I haven't heard a single prosecutor, including Cyrus Vance, former district attorney, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=492.42s)]
*  say that that makes any sense. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=497.3s)]
*  Organized crime cases are won by prosecutors and they put on as witnesses people who have [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=499.74s)]
*  lied and committed crimes. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=504.90000000000003s)]
*  Michael Cohen did lie for 10 years, but he owned those lies and went public in front of a [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=506.98s)]
*  chairman, chairman Cummings. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=512.1s)]
*  And on national and international television, he said, I'm ashamed of my lies. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=513.86s)]
*  Now I'm telling the truth for my country and my children. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=517.9s)]
*  And this is something that a jury will have to decide to weigh Michael's credibility. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=521.78s)]
*  But I also have already said if there is a problem with Michael's credibility, you can be [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=527.02s)]
*  sure that he is backed up multiple times with documents, phone calls, emails. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=531.58s)]
*  So it's not taking his word for anything. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=536.54s)]
*  It's corroborating everything that he says. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=538.9s)]
*  Are you at all concerned about threats of violence directed towards Michael Cohen or [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=541.66s)]
*  perhaps even yourself as this case gets underway? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=546.38s)]
*  So I'd rather not answer that question because I'm told that people who are professionals, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=550.86s)]
*  that you encourage crazy people if they think you're concerned. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=556.5s)]
*  But I do think that the president of the United States has already shown that he's willing [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=561.38s)]
*  to call a mob to the Capitol and to try to have an insurrection while he's watching TV and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=566.14s)]
*  not doing a thing to protect even his own vice president. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=571.86s)]
*  We know that is indisputable. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=575.1s)]
*  Yet no Republican worries about that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=577.34s)]
*  Yet they say it's a politicization of this particular case by the DA in Manhattan, even [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  though the same facts the federal prosecutors found that Michael Cohen had to go to jail for [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=587.14s)]
*  the same facts. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=593.1s)]
*  So I am a little bit concerned about Mr. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=594.46s)]
*  Trump's willingness to at least, let's say, encourage violence. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=596.86s)]
*  He said protest, protest, protest, but he didn't say with no violence. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=602.6199999999999s)]
*  And I am worried about Mr. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=607.38s)]
*  Trump encouraging people to do violence the way he did on January 6th. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=609.06s)]
*  Mr. Lanny Davis, certainly appreciate your time. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=613.66s)]
*  Thank you so much for your insights. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=615.9s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate the invitation. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=618.2199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Yya7B_jCA&t=619.8599999999999s)]
