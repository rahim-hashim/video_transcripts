Video Description: This week, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia wrote a letter to Trump asking for evidence to disprove claims that he accepted an illegal $10 million campaign donation from Egypt just days before his 2017 inauguration. This comes a month after the Washington Post reported that the DOJ started and halted an investigation into the alleged bribe during Trump's presidency. Rep. Jamie Raskin joined MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin to discuss.

# House Dems to Trump: prove you didn't take a $10 million bribe from Egypt
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk)
*  House Democrats are demanding that Donald Trump show proof that he did not take a $10 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=0.0s)]
*  million cash bribe from Egypt. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=6.08s)]
*  In a letter to the former president, Congressman Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia wrote, surely [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=8.64s)]
*  you would agree that the American people deserve to know whether a former president and a current [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=13.24s)]
*  candidate for president took an illegal campaign contribution from a brutal foreign dictator. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=17.96s)]
*  This comes after a damning Washington Post report from last month. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=23.44s)]
*  It claims that five days before Trump's inauguration in 2017, a bank in Cairo received a letter [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=27.32s)]
*  from the Egyptian intelligence service asking it to withdraw $10 million from its account [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=32.96s)]
*  in U.S. currency and all in cash. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=38.2s)]
*  The report has not been independently verified by NBC News, but if true, it would certainly [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=41.24s)]
*  help explain Trump's bizarre description of a meeting he took with Egypt's president back [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=45.58s)]
*  in 2016. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=51.88s)]
*  We met for a long time, actually. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=53.88s)]
*  We had a long meeting and got along. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=56.0s)]
*  There was a good chemistry there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=58.24s)]
*  You know when you have good chemistry with people, you're the king of that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  And there was a very good chemistry, good feeling between us. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=62.32s)]
*  The Washington Post also revealed a DOJ probe into the alleged bribe, which was then shut [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=66.44s)]
*  down after Attorney General Bill Barr intervened. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=71.04s)]
*  Earlier today, I spoke with the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, Congressman [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=74.64s)]
*  Jamie Raskin of Maryland. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=78.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you saw Trump campaign spokesman Steve Chung called your letter textbook fake [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  news. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to respond to it and explain your motivation for sending it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, the textbook fake news translated into normal American vernacular means the truth. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=95.92s)]
*  At least we have every reason to believe that it's true that Egyptian secret services at [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=102.28s)]
*  the behest of President Al Sisi prepared 10 million dollars worth of U.S. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=111.2s)]
*  currency in 20 pounds of 10 dollar bills and then packed it in duffel bags and sent it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=118.8s)]
*  to Donald Trump as a bribe. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=129.28s)]
*  And Trump, who had been famously reluctant to give any of his own money to his campaign, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=131.2s)]
*  despite all of his promises that he would finance the campaign by himself, finally [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=137.56s)]
*  relented and decided to give his campaign 10 million dollars with the reported promise [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=143.04s)]
*  that he would be reimbursed by President Al Sisi and by Egypt. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=149.76s)]
*  And then that 10 million dollars went to a final infusion of cash support for his campaign, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=153.4s)]
*  including for an anti-Semitic TV ad he ran featuring the pictures of Janet Yellen and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=161.8s)]
*  Lloyd Blankfein and George Soros calling them globalists and saying that they were the enemies [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=170.24s)]
*  of American people. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=175.56s)]
*  And then Donald Trump was apparently reportedly reimbursed in January for the money that he [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  put up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=186.96s)]
*  But of course, he wasn't willing to actually put it in. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=187.96s)]
*  So we sent a letter asking him either to deny those charges or to affirm those charges. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  And if he's planning to deny them, to refute them with actual facts against the very specific [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=200.28s)]
*  allegations that have been raised by people who are in a position to know what happened. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=206.72s)]
*  Let me dig in on that for a moment, because I want to highlight some of the striking details [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=211.96s)]
*  that came out of this Washington Post investigation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=216.4s)]
*  The DOJ was in the middle of an investigation into the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=221.2s)]
*  US dollar bills. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=227.44s)]
*  The DOJ was in the middle of an investigation into the US dollar bills. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=228.44s)]
*  The DOJ was in the middle of an investigation into the US dollar bills. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=231.44s)]
*  The DOJ was in the middle of an investigation into the US dollar bills. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=234.44s)]
*  The DOJ was in the middle of an investigation into the US dollar bills. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=237.44s)]
*  The DOJ was in the middle of an investigation into the US dollar bills. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=240.44s)]
*  The DOJ was in the middle of an investigation into the US dollar bills. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=243.44s)]
*  The DOJ was in the middle of an investigation into the US dollar bills. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=246.44s)]
*  What is the connection here with Bill Barr? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=249.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, thank you for the correction. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=252.44s)]
*  That $10 million did not weigh 20 pounds. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=255.44s)]
*  As I said, it weighed 200 pounds, which is just astonishing that he got 200 pounds worth [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=258.44s)]
*  of American dollars in a foreign bribe, allegedly, according to the Washington Post. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=265.44s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump was telling his attorney general, William Barr, what investigations [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=271.44s)]
*  to shut down and what investigations to open up. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=280.44s)]
*  That was an infamous pattern of Donald Trump's administration. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=284.44s)]
*  He really used the Department of Justice like his in-house law firm and political flunkies. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=289.44s)]
*  It seems entirely credible that there was movement within the US Attorney's Office [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=296.44s)]
*  and the Department of Justice to investigate these extraordinary and very specific, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=302.44s)]
*  factually anchored allegations. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=309.44s)]
*  But then William Barr just shut the whole thing down. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=311.44s)]
*  So we need to get to the bottom of this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=314.44s)]
*  I know that people's eyes glaze over now when they hear about the corruption of Donald Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=317.44s)]
*  But what we're talking about is a $10 million bribe from a foreign dictator proffered in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=322.44s)]
*  the weeks before a presidential election. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=330.44s)]
*  And we know that the autocratic dictator of Egypt was someone who got the benefit of Donald Trump's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=333.44s)]
*  tilt, just like the homicidal crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=343.44s)]
*  Yeah, you bring up again an interesting point that I was going to ask you about, which was that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=351.44s)]
*  earlier this year you also pressed Republicans to investigate Jared Kushner's influence, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=355.44s)]
*  foreign influence peddling. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=360.44s)]
*  Kushner reportedly still trying to make quid pro quo deals with foreign governments, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=361.44s)]
*  even as his father-in-law runs for president again. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=367.44s)]
*  And this time it comes after he accepted a $2 billion investment from the Saudi government [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=370.44s)]
*  into his private investment firm, six months, mere six months after he left the White House. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=376.44s)]
*  Even James Comer admitted he, quote, crossed the line of ethics with that one. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=382.44s)]
*  Is there a chance to get any kind of answers to some of these questions that you are posing, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=386.44s)]
*  whether it be about Jared Kushner or about his father-in-law, Donald Trump? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=391.44s)]
*  Well, not as long as the Republicans hold the gavel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=395.44s)]
*  But this is something that the Democrats have been determined to get to the bottom of because it goes [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=398.44s)]
*  right to the heart of what kind of government we're going to have. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=404.44s)]
*  I mean, the founders of the country built into the Constitution this foreign emoluments clause [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=407.44s)]
*  in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which says that nobody in federal office, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=414.44s)]
*  including the president, can collect a present in emoluments, which just means a payment, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=420.44s)]
*  an office or title of any kind, whatever the Constitution says from a king, a prince or a foreign state. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=425.44s)]
*  And yet that became the whole MO of the Trump administration. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=433.44s)]
*  Rather than using the government as an instrument of the common good to try to make life better for Americans, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=440.44s)]
*  the government was used as a money-making operation for the guy who got in and for his family and for his corporations. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=446.44s)]
*  And of course, they want to go back to that now. It's never ended. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=453.44s)]
*  But that $2 billion that Jared Kushner pocketed from Saudi Arabia, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=457.44s)]
*  despite the protestations of the sovereign wealth advisement fund in Saudi Arabia, which said it was a bad investment, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=465.44s)]
*  that $2 billion is the largest payment we know of. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=476.44s)]
*  But it is reflective of the general character of the administration. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=479.44s)]
*  And this $10 million obviously could have made a real difference in terms of the outcome of the presidential election, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=486.44s)]
*  just like the hush money payoffs to Donald Trump's mistress. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=495.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's a one more reminder of what's at stake come this November with the ability to actually find answers [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=501.44s)]
*  to these very pressing questions that you and Democrats are trying to raise. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=508.44s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, always a pleasure. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=511.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILvCmTHZfk&t=516.44s)]
