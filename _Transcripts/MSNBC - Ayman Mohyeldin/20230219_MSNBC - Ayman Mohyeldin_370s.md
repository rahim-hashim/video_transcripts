Video Description: Twelve days after a devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, people are still being rescued underneath all the rubble. Over 46,000 people have died in both countries, but that number is expected to grow because rescue teams in Syria have only been able to search five percent of the affected areas thus far. MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin speaks with Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, CEO of Mercy Corps, a global humanitarian organization working on relief efforts in Syria.

# Relief efforts continue in Syria as death tolls rise
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q)
*  Signs of light, even 12 days after that devastating earthquake struck Turkey and Syria. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  People are suffering day in and day out, and yet unimaginable miracles are still a daily [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=8.94s)]
*  ritual. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=14.88s)]
*  Yesterday, this man was rescued nearly 11 days after being buried under the rubble in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=15.88s)]
*  southwest Turkey. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=20.68s)]
*  His first concern as he lay on a stretcher after surviving for 261 hours? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=22.16s)]
*  How his mother is doing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=27.84s)]
*  Here he is speaking on the phone to a relative asking about his mother and the rest of his [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=29.48s)]
*  family. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=34.16s)]
*  His relative responded, everyone is good brother. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=35.28s)]
*  We are all waiting for you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=38.2s)]
*  Over 46,000 people have died across both countries, but that staggering number is expected to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=40.44s)]
*  grow for two reasons. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=45.46s)]
*  One, Syria has been slow to report its death figures and the Syrian government, mired in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=46.96s)]
*  decade long civil war, is blocking global relief efforts. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  The Norwegian refugee council has reported that rescue teams in Syria were only able [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=56.92s)]
*  to search 5% of the earthquakes affected area, leaving potential survivors trapped [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=61.6s)]
*  under the rubble in the other 95% of the region. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=67.92s)]
*  Let's discuss this and more with Jada Doyin-McKenna, the CEO of Mercy Corps, a global humanitarian [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=72.6s)]
*  organization that is facilitating relief efforts in Syria. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=77.56s)]
*  Jay, it's great to see you again. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=81.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=83.4s)]
*  Describe the situation on the ground in Syria for us right now based on what you're hearing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=85.28s)]
*  The situation on the ground is dire. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  That's because it already was coming into a dire situation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=94.2s)]
*  Before the earthquake, we were delivering humanitarian assistance in Syria due to the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=98.16s)]
*  decades long conflict that you mentioned. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=102.48s)]
*  You're already dealing with a population where the infrastructure has already been quite [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  weakened and damaged in terms of building quality. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  There has been an outflow of talent in hospitals and other critical things. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=115.32s)]
*  These are citizens that have been on the roof that were already receiving critical food [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  and shelter from organizations like ours. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=125.56s)]
*  We were serving about 300,000 people in northwest Syria before the earthquake even hit. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=128.12s)]
*  While the absolute numbers of people affected in Turkey may be larger because it was closer [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=135.0s)]
*  to the epicenter, the depth of destruction and devastation is very much going to be [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=139.68s)]
*  much more difficult for the people of Syria. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=148.24s)]
*  Can you talk to us a little bit about the obstacles to rescue and aid efforts and what [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=150.4s)]
*  are the biggest needs at this moment? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=154.72s)]
*  I can imagine that there are both diplomatic, political, as well as logistical challenges [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=156.84s)]
*  in getting these relief efforts into Syria. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tough situation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=164.96s)]
*  The good thing is relief efforts are coming in, but we have to make sure that that remains [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  in place. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=172.72s)]
*  In a normal circumstance, Turkey would be a first responder for an event like this in [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=174.64s)]
*  Syria. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=179.88s)]
*  However, in this case, Turkey is heavily affected. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=180.88s)]
*  Many of the most reliable supply routes in and out of northwest Syria, so those trucks [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=184.64s)]
*  are having to go through, pass a lot of other trauma to get to the trauma of Syria. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=192.48s)]
*  We also had a situation where Syria didn't have the same kinds of rubble remover and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=199.96s)]
*  heavy machinery to really clean up as well and to get to people after the earthquake. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=205.56s)]
*  It's just a little bit more difficult to navigate the terrain on top of the fact that it is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=211.04s)]
*  a very cold and brutal winter with a lot of snow and rain. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=216.56s)]
*  We are doing things as basic as even putting down gravel in displacement camps where we [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=222.48s)]
*  were already working just to get through that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=227.52s)]
*  So it's very, very difficult. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=230.44s)]
*  We think there are about almost 300,000 people in immediate need of assistance in Syria. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=232.24s)]
*  And the needs that we are giving right now include basic shelter, tarps, things like [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=238.52s)]
*  jerry cans, solar lamps, blankets, mattresses. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=247.32s)]
*  People do not have adequate shelter at all. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=251.72s)]
*  Or just helping people get a roof over their head. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=255.12s)]
*  Food and some warmth is our priority. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=258.12s)]
*  As we go forward, we will continue with food, more durable shelter solutions for people, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=260.92s)]
*  and also just helping beginning to think about the rebuilding effort. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  Can you talk to us a little bit about the Syrian government in this? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=270.92s)]
*  The Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has admitted that he needs help. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  Is the government helping or slowing down relief efforts? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=278.88s)]
*  What do you know about what the central government is in Damascus is doing on this front? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  One of the things that we try to urge donors is to really focus on where the aid is most [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=288.32s)]
*  needed and not just where it is easiest to reach. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=293.12s)]
*  The Assad administration has opened two more border crossings. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=297.0s)]
*  They have been open. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=301.0s)]
*  The part of Syria, northwest Syria, where we do our work is actually not controlled [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=301.96s)]
*  by the Assad government. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  But throughout all of Turkey, there are very well-worn protocols and routes that have been [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=309.96s)]
*  coordinated through the UN in and out to help us get to the people in need. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=318.56s)]
*  So that has been going on for a decade. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=322.56s)]
*  So those routes are open. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  And as you said, there is a recognition everywhere that the people of Syria really need the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=326.56s)]
*  support. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=331.52s)]
*  Yeah, and we certainly hope anyone who is watching who wants to help to consider helping [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=332.52s)]
*  all of the work that you're doing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=335.64s)]
*  Jada Doyan, McKenna CEO of Mercy Corps, thank you so much to you and everyone involved in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=337.32s)]
*  your organization for the effort. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=341.56s)]
*  Thank you for bringing attention. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=342.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=343.56s)]
*  Our pleasure. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=344.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yba58xy8Q&t=345.56s)]
