# Minneapolis Police Kill Amir Locke While Serving “No-Knock” Warrant
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs)
*  Let's start tonight's show by asking you at home or wherever you may be to take a look at where you are in this very minute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=0.0s)]
*  Where are you sitting? What are you doing? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Are you sitting on the couch tucked under a blanket? Maybe you'll doze off there before you can make it to bed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=10.24s)]
*  Look, honestly, we've all been there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Now imagine that in the comfort of that moment, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  you wake up in the early hours of the morning to a group of armed men barging into your home. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=21.44s)]
*  You're confused. You're scared. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=28.0s)]
*  What are you going to do? How are you going to react? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=30.96s)]
*  For 22 year old Amir Locke, a black man in Minneapolis, this wasn't some imaginary scenario. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=34.96s)]
*  No, it wasn't. Early Wednesday morning, police killed Locke while executing a no-knock warrant. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  And before we get into the circumstances surrounding Locke's death, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=47.2s)]
*  I actually want to take a step back for a moment. I want to tell you a little bit about his life. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=50.56s)]
*  Because once again, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=55.68s)]
*  we have to learn about another black man in America, not because of how he lived or what he wanted to do or what he did with his life, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=57.44s)]
*  but by how he was killed by the police. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=65.44s)]
*  Amir was born in the suburbs of St. Paul, Minnesota. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=69.92s)]
*  As a kid, he played basketball, even tried out for his high school football team. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  But his true passion in life, his true calling he felt was music. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=76.8s)]
*  And before his death, Locke had filled file paperwork to start a music business, even designing a logo. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  This week, the 22 year old had planned to move to Dallas, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  where he hoped to take the next step in his hip hop career and be closer to his mom. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  His father described his son as a bright light, and his cousin remembered Locke as having a big heart. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=96.0s)]
*  In Minneapolis, he worked as a food delivery driver, and according to his family, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  he had recently purchased a gun for protection due to a spike in carjackings. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  Now that gun, which his family says was purchased legally, is now at the center of what took place Wednesday morning. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  When police entered the apartment, they found Locke sleeping on a couch under a blanket [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=117.68s)]
*  with his weapon nearby. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  In newly released body camera footage, we can see the moments that led up to Locke's death. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  And we have to warn you at home, this may be hard to watch. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  Here you see officers entering the apartment with a key, and just nine seconds later, nine seconds, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=134.88000000000002s)]
*  Minneapolis police officer Mark Hanneman shoots Locke. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=140.94000000000003s)]
*  Now here's the thing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  No-knock raids are supposed to be rarely used as a police tactic. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=146.56s)]
*  They were designed to give law enforcement a tactical advantage, because under a no-knock warrant, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=151.36s)]
*  police can actually enter a private property without first alerting those inside, hence the name no-knock. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=156.8s)]
*  They're commonly used for drug busts so that suspects can potentially avoid hiding evidence. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=163.76s)]
*  But the no-knock warrant police had that day [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=169.44s)]
*  was for a homicide investigation, not a drug bust. And Amir Locke's name was actually nowhere on that no-knock warrant. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=172.16s)]
*  In fact, it wasn't even his apartment. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=182.32s)]
*  Now if this whole ordeal sounds familiar to you, that's because it is. No-knock warrants [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=185.12s)]
*  came under intense criticism in this country following the 2020 killing of Breonna Taylor [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=189.92s)]
*  during a no-knock raid in Louisville, Kentucky. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=194.16s)]
*  And now, following the fatal shooting of Amir Locke, the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frye, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=197.76s)]
*  ordered an immediate halt to the tactic while the city consults with experts to review and possibly revise the policy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Look, Amir Locke's death comes at a time when the city of Minneapolis is already on edge, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=210.48s)]
*  following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. Floyd's death, you may recall, at the hands of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=215.12s)]
*  shined a light not only on police violence, but it also put into question, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=221.04s)]
*  clearly, how much we can take law enforcement at their word. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=225.84s)]
*  Now, activists in Minneapolis are already questioning local authorities over their report for what went down Wednesday morning. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=229.68s)]
*  During a press conference after the release of that body camera footage, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=236.4s)]
*  Nikkima Levi Armstrong, a local civil rights attorney who also serves as the co-chair of the city's new commission on community safety, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  called out Mayor Frye and Interim Police Chief Amelia Huffman. Armstrong demanded answers and accountability like we all do. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=247.36s)]
*  I don't know how you guys slept that night. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  I couldn't sleep at night. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=261.04s)]
*  Tears from a mother's perspective thinking about what happened. I saw the picture of Amiri. He looks like a boy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=262.88s)]
*  My son is 17 years old. He has slept on his friend's couches for sleepovers. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  So we cannot sit here and whitewash this and pretend that it's okay. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  I signed up to help bring recommendations because we're tired of being killed. We're tired of the cover-ups. We're tired of the excuses. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=279.68s)]
*  So as we all wait for more details to come to light, Locke's family hopes their son's death [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=289.44s)]
*  sparks change and not just conversation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=294.64s)]
*  I want everybody to know that my son is going to make sure [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=296.74s)]
*  that everybody across the United States [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  is going to be able to sleep on the couch without having to be worried about being executed by the police. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=308.58s)]
*  You [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcfmGXa6rs&t=326.74s)]
