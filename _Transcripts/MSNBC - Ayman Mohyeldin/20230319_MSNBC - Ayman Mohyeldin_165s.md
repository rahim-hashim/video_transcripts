# How Wyoming's governor is testing legislative pathways to ban abortion pill
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0)
*  We know that many GOP-led states have already passed near total abortion bans, which includes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=0.0s)]
*  the use of medication. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=7.84s)]
*  But last night, one governor doubled down, Mark Gordon of Wyoming, signed a bill specifically [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=10.36s)]
*  banning abortion pills set to go into effect July 1st. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=15.34s)]
*  Back with me again are Brittany Packnett-Cunningham and Elena Beverly. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  Brittany, I'll start with you on this and this news out of Wyoming. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=23.64s)]
*  Near total abortion bans already, as we've mentioned, outlaw abortion pills in the states [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=27.88s)]
*  that have them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=33.92s)]
*  But in Wyoming, the abortion ban was blocked by the courts. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=35.36s)]
*  Is this the governor's way of trying to push an abortion ban through? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=39.94s)]
*  And what kind of message does it send as we await for this ruling in Texas? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=43.36s)]
*  It's not only this governor's attempt to try to circumvent the courts and move forward [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  with a near total or total abortion ban across the state. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=54.5s)]
*  This is also about testing different pathways to ban abortion across the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  Look, the GOP has been very clear for the last 50 years that this was their goal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=64.06s)]
*  They have organized and rallied people around the single issue of stopping abortion and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  access to it for five decades. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=77.82s)]
*  They have nominated judges. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=81.22s)]
*  As you said, they've recruited volunteers and canvassers and candidates. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=82.9s)]
*  This has been the way that they have built a so-called conservative agenda and conservative [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=88.5s)]
*  party, a so-called religious right, based on this single agenda for the last five decades [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=93.86s)]
*  once again. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=99.14s)]
*  So this is all about making sure that there are many options for governors and for mayors, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=100.14s)]
*  folks in state legislatures to figure out a way forward, irrespective of what the courts [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=106.74s)]
*  say, of what the people say. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  So it's going to be up to Congress to make sure that they actually enshrine the right [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=114.06s)]
*  to an abortion in federal statutes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=118.8s)]
*  There are millions of people across this country who fought through difficult challenges to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=121.84s)]
*  show up at the ballot box to make sure that the right to an abortion was protected. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=127.22s)]
*  And it's high time that Congress actually ensure that that happens and stop these threats [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=132.88s)]
*  from happening all over the country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kFxZXW39L0&t=137.88s)]
