# 'Living in two realities': How Trump used podcasts, new media to win the election
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI)
*  A Donald Trump's victory speech as family, friends and campaign staff took to the stage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=0.0s)]
*  and celebrated, we heard some unusual thank yous you don't normally hear from any political [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=6.76s)]
*  campaign. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=12.6s)]
*  For example, here is UFC CEO and Trump supporter Dana White. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=13.6s)]
*  I want to thank some people real quick. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=18.32s)]
*  I want to thank the NELP boys, Aidan Ross, Theo Vaughn, Bustin' with the Boys, and last [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=19.96s)]
*  but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=26.48s)]
*  Now, if you're not familiar with any of those names, White was shouting out just some of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=30.16s)]
*  the massive podcasters and live streamers who embraced and platformed Donald Trump during [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=35.96s)]
*  his campaign. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=41.32s)]
*  Now, it wasn't the first time Trump used new media to his advantage. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=42.32s)]
*  The New York Times reported this week that Donald Trump has been doing this all of his [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  adult life, from building his persona in the New York tabloids in the 80s to the reality [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=49.96s)]
*  TV craze that helped spawn the apprentice and create the false impression that he was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=54.28s)]
*  actually a successful businessman. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=58.84s)]
*  To being an early adapter of Twitter, now called X, Donald Trump has always been a master [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  at media manipulation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  In all the election postmortems about how Trump won the presidency, again, we have to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=68.36s)]
*  acknowledge that despite being the oldest man ever elected president, Donald Trump was [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=72.2s)]
*  ahead of the curve in an ever-changing media landscape. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=76.92s)]
*  And instead of subjecting himself to fact-checking from the likes of 60 Minutes, Trump was able [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=80.68s)]
*  to reach tens of millions of American voters in a fact-free, safe space, casually mixing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=85.12s)]
*  talk about golf, drugs, or whatever with his campaign message. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=91.2s)]
*  You know, the weave. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  It paid off big time, not only because of the sheer amount of voters he was able to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=96.72s)]
*  reach but the type of voters he reached, younger voters and particularly younger men, the so-called [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  bro vote. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  According to NBC News, exit polling, Trump picked up a larger proportion of voters, under [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  30, than any Republican presidential candidate since 2008. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  With men under 30, Trump beat Harris by two points after losing to Joe Biden with this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  very same group by 11 points back in 2020. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  The Trump strategist credited with this idea, 18-year-old Barron Trump, two sources familiar [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=126.56s)]
*  with the strategy, told NBC News Trump's youngest son was behind the campaign pivot toward influential [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=132.36s)]
*  male podcasters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=137.66s)]
*  A senior Trump adviser told Politico's Deep Dive podcast, every single recommendation [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=138.66s)]
*  he has had has turned out to be absolute ratings gold that has broken the internet. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=143.62s)]
*  Joining me now to weigh in on all this, Paolo Ramos, MSNBC contributor and author of Defectors, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=150.18s)]
*  the Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=154.62s)]
*  Hayes Brown, writer and editor at MSNBC Daily, and Dean Obadalla, MSNBC Daily columnist and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=157.82s)]
*  host of Sirius XM's The Dean Obadalla Show. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=162.46s)]
*  So I'll start with you, Paolo, because there's this kind of myth that the vice president [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=166.78s)]
*  did not do enough podcasts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=170.62s)]
*  And that's not true. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=173.54s)]
*  I mean, she did several podcasts. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=174.54s)]
*  She did her own alternative media outlets. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=176.22s)]
*  She was on Call Her Daddy, Shannon Sharpe's podcast. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  There are things out there that she did. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=182.26s)]
*  She may not have done the bro vote ones, but she definitely went out with the bro shows. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=183.54s)]
*  But she definitely did her own. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=188.7s)]
*  Do you think that there's merit to this idea that Trump's embrace of this type of cultural [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=190.66s)]
*  phenomenon, media phenomenon, was different than the way the vice president did? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=194.86s)]
*  I think so, because I think he was doing that all the time, constantly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=198.54000000000002s)]
*  And think about his last day before the election. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=202.86s)]
*  He was in Pennsylvania, and he looked at his crowd and he said, all right, all right, I'm [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  going to go off teleprompter because I want to speak truth. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  So I think that kind of tells you what the strategy has been, that for over a year, he [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=212.54000000000002s)]
*  has been speaking his version of truth in this other ecosystem for months and months. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=216.86s)]
*  And I think that in that world is where the sort of MAGA crowd has also been speaking [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=223.18s)]
*  their version of truth that is never captured in the polls and in the numbers and in the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  stats and in sort of cable TV, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=231.18s)]
*  A version of truth where they get to say whatever they feel, whatever they want. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=233.5s)]
*  They get to expose their grievances, the sexism, the misogyny to the point that perhaps, and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=237.02s)]
*  I was thinking about this, like the MSG, Puerto Rico comments, maybe in our ecosystem, we [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=242.3s)]
*  were all horrified by that, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=249.34s)]
*  Because here we fact check, we sort of point the audience towards moral clarities. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  But in that ecosystem, it was so normalized, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  They've been saying that language for so long that it didn't end up being this huge blow [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=258.06s)]
*  for the Trump campaign. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  So she brings up a really interesting point about this comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=264.14s)]
*  When he made those comments, vulgar comments about Puerto Rico being an island of garbage [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=268.62s)]
*  in the middle of the ocean, I think everyone who's watching that was shocked. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=272.22s)]
*  But to Paolo's point, he is a comedian. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=276.14s)]
*  He kind of has this shock-jock to him factor. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=279.02s)]
*  They kind of brushed it off saying, like, oh, it's not a thing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=283.42s)]
*  People who know him know that's his comedy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=285.34s)]
*  What does that tell you just about the information streams in this country and the polarization [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=287.74s)]
*  that exists? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=291.98s)]
*  We live in more and more silos. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=293.1s)]
*  We don't even live in the same planet. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=295.26s)]
*  We share the soil with people that get their news and their information, their data, and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=297.02s)]
*  their comedy from different worlds. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  Every now and then they intersect, and we are stunned. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=303.82s)]
*  We're like, what is going on? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=305.74s)]
*  And everyone's like, oh, that's a kill Tony, whatever, you know, the guy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=306.94s)]
*  They're like, everyone knows him. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=310.06s)]
*  I have friends telling me that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=311.18s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=312.3s)]
*  Friends who know him from the comedy club world in New York, that's what he does. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=313.66s)]
*  So they got that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=317.02s)]
*  We're like, this is outrageous. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=318.38s)]
*  But I'll say this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=319.82s)]
*  Vice President Harris joined this campaign late. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=320.62s)]
*  We all know that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=322.3s)]
*  I think in 2028, you're going to see Democrats, they're already running, to be honest, for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=323.42s)]
*  the nomination, make podcasts, make wildly popular shows like the Dean Obidawale show, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=327.42s)]
*  one of the key shows to go on. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=332.78s)]
*  I'm just going to say that might be a good show. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=334.7s)]
*  But they're going to go podcasts. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=336.54s)]
*  Could you get any other presidential candidates in this election cycle? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=337.82s)]
*  Not U.S. presidential candidates. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=341.18s)]
*  Other countries, like the Palestinian candidates, I had them on. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  But look, the other thing is Trump got two bites. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=347.18s)]
*  He got the podcast audience, and he got the mainstream press for going on that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=350.06s)]
*  So it was kind of very effective in that way. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=354.3s)]
*  Joe Rogan had 47 million people watch Trump on YouTube do that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=356.94s)]
*  You go on a show, except for yours, most shows don't get that kind of ratings on cable news [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=361.74s)]
*  Yeah, me and Joe Rogan are kind of going head to head. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  You like the Arab Rogan? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=368.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, week to week it really varies, you know. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=369.5s)]
*  But I do want to, speaking of Joe Rogan, right, like I mean, I watched, I didn't watch the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=371.98s)]
*  three hours of it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=375.74s)]
*  I couldn't watch the three hours of it, but I watched a lot of it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=376.38000000000005s)]
*  There is not a lot of fact checking in this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=379.66s)]
*  And I get that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=382.22s)]
*  That's his style. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=382.86s)]
*  And his whole approach is like, I just want to get to know the person. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=383.98s)]
*  It's hard for me to imagine that after nine years of Donald Trump on this scene, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=386.94000000000005s)]
*  you really get to know who Donald Trump is, because also Donald Trump really sells himself [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=390.54s)]
*  to whoever he's speaking to. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  He is different things to different people at any given moment. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=397.42s)]
*  So the idea that like you're really getting to know the man is a bit of a stretch, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  but that's how he builds it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=403.9s)]
*  Except for the fact that the people listening to those podcasts were the ones who were [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=404.94s)]
*  what in their teens, maybe or younger when they when Donald Trump was first president. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=409.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=413.58s)]
*  So they are just getting to know him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=413.9s)]
*  Like I remember before the election, there was a TikTok trend that went around where [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=415.82s)]
*  people were, Gen Zers were just realizing about the Hollywood, the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=419.34s)]
*  They had never seen it before. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=424.86s)]
*  They had no idea what it's about. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=425.74s)]
*  They're like, what is going on here? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=426.7s)]
*  So I do think there is something to be said for Trump introducing himself to these audiences. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=428.38s)]
*  And honestly, reading that New York Times piece that you referenced, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=432.7s)]
*  it only just hit me that, yeah, Trump rallies, they are a stream of consciousness [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  in need of an editor. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=440.14s)]
*  They are just a one person podcast stream. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=441.26s)]
*  And so no wonder it sounds so familiar. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=444.14s)]
*  Why he's so comfortable in this space and why so many people listening to him. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=446.62s)]
*  Whereas we listen to the rallies like what he's talking about. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=450.86s)]
*  They're just hearing like picking up pieces that flow over them on the course of like [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=454.22s)]
*  the three hours that they're listening to Joe Rogan, just little bits and pieces and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=458.86s)]
*  clinging to what they are listening for as opposed to getting lost in the weave like [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=462.06s)]
*  we do trying to figure exactly what the heck he's talking about. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=466.3s)]
*  Part of the postmortem analysis, I'm sure you've heard this as well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=468.94000000000005s)]
*  And probably he's really excited about it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=472.14000000000004s)]
*  It's like, where is the Democrat like Joe Rogan? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  Like, why don't why don't the Democrats have a job? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=476.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=478.3s)]
*  How hard is the fight? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=479.18s)]
*  I'm sitting with you. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=480.54s)]
*  And so like I like I was joking aside, is that the right question, though? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=482.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, people have also responded to that by pointing out saying like at one point, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=486.14s)]
*  Joe Rogan actually was a fan of Bernie Sanders. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=489.74s)]
*  And the fact that the Democratic Party did not do more outreach to him, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=493.5s)]
*  did not have a constant kind of like connection with him, so to speak, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=496.78s)]
*  is probably a reason why they lost him in the end. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=500.46s)]
*  I think at the very least, we need to understand that world. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=502.86s)]
*  Like we're talking about Joe Rogan, guess who's a big part of his audience? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=505.34s)]
*  Latinos. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=509.5s)]
*  Over 30 percent of his audience are Latinos, right? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=510.46s)]
*  Like young Latino men. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=513.34s)]
*  And so we weren't really talking about that either. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=514.54s)]
*  And I do think the fear, though, is that to your point, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=516.78s)]
*  like we are literally living in true realities, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=520.3s)]
*  And like the day of the election, every single voter noted that democracy was their top issue. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=522.86s)]
*  And three out of four people said that they were concerned about the state of democracy. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=528.86s)]
*  But we all had completely different versions of what that front meant. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=532.78s)]
*  Because our ecosystems were so completely different in the way that we were all talking [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=537.18s)]
*  about democracy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=542.6999999999999s)]
*  And so we better start understanding what they're saying there, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=543.42s)]
*  because those are now becoming the trusted voices that are sort of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=546.62s)]
*  shaping the way that people are thinking about democracy. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=550.4599999999999s)]
*  And that's important. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=552.78s)]
*  What's your take on it? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=553.5s)]
*  I think that I agree that we should be listening and figure out what they're saying [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=554.62s)]
*  in these mediums. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=560.14s)]
*  But I think that this is the new version of Democrats need their own facts and news, right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=560.8599999999999s)]
*  This is just chasing to see like, OK, where are the conservatives talking? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=564.38s)]
*  What are they? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=568.86s)]
*  Where are they conversing on all these issues and saying we need a version of that too. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=569.9s)]
*  But Joe Rogan, he was popular before he had his podcast. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=574.54s)]
*  He was on a popular TV show. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=577.02s)]
*  He had a game show host. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=578.54s)]
*  He had an audience before becoming the Joe Rogan of podcast world, of the right wing bro. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=580.7s)]
*  Are you taking a dig at Dean saying he was in it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=586.38s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying he's like... [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=588.22s)]
*  I went on a Comedy Central special in 2008. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=590.46s)]
*  I'm saying Dean is a game show. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=592.86s)]
*  And if you were up in the middle of the night, you probably saw that special. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=594.22s)]
*  Byron Allen's Comics Unleashed 2012. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=597.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm there. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=599.74s)]
*  I'm not sure why you missed the A's. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=600.14s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=602.14s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=602.86s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  But, you know, genuinely speaking about this kind of... [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=604.06s)]
*  I've watched a lot of these podcasts and it's just kind of like getting together and you [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  kind of shoot in the breeze about these topics. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=613.42s)]
*  It's not... [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=615.3399999999999s)]
*  I don't want to say it's not journalistic. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=616.06s)]
*  It has a journalistic value because it gives insight into one's thinking. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=617.74s)]
*  But it doesn't replace actual journalism where there is fact checking. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=621.58s)]
*  And I feel like there is probably a specific reason why they wanted to do these because [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=627.6600000000001s)]
*  you are not getting fact checked in real time. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=632.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=636.14s)]
*  That is the conscious decision by Donald Trump to go on with Joe Rogan. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=636.94s)]
*  So you're not getting facts, but you know what you're getting? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=640.86s)]
*  You're getting to know Donald Trump as a person. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=642.86s)]
*  So if you don't know him well, you listen to three hours. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=645.58s)]
*  In the three hours, whoever that person is, if you've liked it, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=647.74s)]
*  they're like your friend. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=650.94s)]
*  They really... they have a connection that's unlike normal political person [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=652.1400000000001s)]
*  and someone on, like with you or Joy Reader, someone else. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=656.1400000000001s)]
*  It's a personal connection and that's a winning strategy to get to know the person. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=658.94s)]
*  But it's a parasocial connection. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=662.7800000000001s)]
*  Like it's not an actual real one. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=664.3000000000001s)]
*  I feel like over the next four years, it'll be interesting to see what happens when all [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=665.9000000000001s)]
*  the promises and the Donald Trump they think that they know turns out to be someone else [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=669.34s)]
*  entirely different. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbzEohgWI&t=673.0200000000001s)]
