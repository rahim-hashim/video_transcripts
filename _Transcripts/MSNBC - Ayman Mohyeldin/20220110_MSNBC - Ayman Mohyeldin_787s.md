# Family Of Rosanne Boyland Still Searching For Answers 1 Year After January 6th
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48)
*  So, with every day that has passed since the January 6 attack, it has become more and more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=0.0s)]
*  clear just how damaged we as a country are. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=7.0s)]
*  The insurrection exposed both the deepening fault lines in our population and cracks in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=10.48s)]
*  the very structure of our democracy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=15.44s)]
*  It opened a wound many of us want to heal from, but find ourselves quite honestly unable [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=18.44s)]
*  to, a sentiment that President Joe Biden reiterated on Thursday on the anniversary of the attack. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=24.6s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=30.12s)]
*  The way you have to heal, you have to recognize the extent of the wound. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  You can't pretend. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  This is serious stuff. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=38.0s)]
*  You've got to face it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=39.52s)]
*  That's what great nations do. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=41.52s)]
*  They face the truth, deal with it, and move on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=44.52s)]
*  President Biden is right here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=51.72s)]
*  How can we heal when our cries for justice and accountability have largely gone unanswered, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=53.32s)]
*  when the people and the party that stood to benefit from overturning the election results [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=58.32s)]
*  refuse to even acknowledge the realities of what happened on that day, when after a year [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=62.64s)]
*  of investigation, no one has been held accountable outside of some of the foot soldiers in Trump's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  mob? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=72.68s)]
*  A national healing process is necessary. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=73.68s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=75.76s)]
*  But as I found out over the past year, it's also something that the families who lost [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=76.76s)]
*  loved ones on that day are also struggling with. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=80.86s)]
*  This is Roseanne Boylan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=84.56s)]
*  She was one of the five people who died at the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=86.24s)]
*  Although I didn't know Roseanne personally, we both came from the same hometown. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=89.72s)]
*  We went to the same high school. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  A year ago to this day, her brother-in-law, Justin Cave, who was a friend of mine in high [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  school, reached out to me on Facebook and asked if I'd be willing to hear her story. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  That sparked a year-long investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=105.72s)]
*  Now, in the months before January 6th, her family and friends believed that she had fallen [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=110.16s)]
*  deeper and deeper into the QAnon conspiracy theory world, undergoing a rapid radicalization. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=115.0s)]
*  They had no other way to explain how she went from an apolitical woman who was devoted to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  her extended family into a hardcore supporter of Donald Trump. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=126.08s)]
*  Now, in the months since Roseanne's death, her family has struggled to find answers as [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=129.84s)]
*  to how exactly she died. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=134.64s)]
*  It's a question that a lot of people in this country have. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=137.04s)]
*  Now, according to the medical examiner's office, it was because of a prescription drug overdose, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=139.28s)]
*  a conclusion that didn't make sense to the family given the video evidence from that day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=143.92s)]
*  As the Republican Party has tried to distort the narrative of the January 6th attack, Roseanne's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=149.28s)]
*  family has had to deal with her death being used for political ends by the Republican [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=154.04s)]
*  Party. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=158.0s)]
*  Much like our national search for healing and accountability, the family's efforts [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=159.0s)]
*  to uncover the truth often left them with more questions than answers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=162.88s)]
*  Joining me now are Justin and Lana Cave. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=168.8s)]
*  This is their first ever live TV interview together. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=171.12s)]
*  Lana and Justin, our sister and brother-in-law of Roseanne Boylan, who I, as I mentioned, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  died at the Capitol on January the 6th. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Guys, thank you so much. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=180.44s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=182.08s)]
*  Lana, I know it's been a year since your sister died. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=183.08s)]
*  We just came out of the holiday season. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=186.36s)]
*  We have talked about this in the past, you and I, but just tell us how you and your family [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  are doing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=192.16s)]
*  What were the holidays like this year without her? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=193.16s)]
*  What did you tell your children, who I knew were very close to their aunt Roro, about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=195.56s)]
*  why she wasn't with you? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=199.16s)]
*  Yeah, these last six months have been really difficult. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=201.84s)]
*  We went straight from Thanksgiving, or excuse me, six weeks. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=206.24s)]
*  We went from Thanksgiving to Christmas to New Year's to the anniversary. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=210.16s)]
*  So it was really hard for all of us in the family. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=216.32s)]
*  Our oldest daughter, who's six, wanted us to say that Christmas just wasn't the same [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  without Roro. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  And then our youngest daughter, who's five, had mentioned that all she wanted for Christmas [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=228.92s)]
*  was Roro to be back. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=234.64s)]
*  So it was pretty difficult trying to explain to them that that's not how it works. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=237.64s)]
*  And I would tell them all about it one day. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  But yeah, it was awful. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=246.11999999999998s)]
*  We went out of town for January 6th, and we had some press requests and decided to turn [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=250.6s)]
*  the television off and try to spend some time together as a family. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=257.8s)]
*  For me, it was hard watching Lana's parents on January 6th. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=261.72s)]
*  You could see it on their face, having to wrestle with the memories from a year ago [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  this week when this tragedy happened. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=273.04s)]
*  It was really difficult. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=277.56s)]
*  I was going to say, and I appreciate you taking the time with us this evening. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=280.6s)]
*  I know how difficult it is for your family. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=283.36s)]
*  I do really appreciate you joining me this evening to talk about this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=285.24s)]
*  Justin, as I mentioned, it's been a year to the day since you actually reached out to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=289.48s)]
*  me in the immediate aftermath of Roseanne's death. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=293.8s)]
*  And you yourself, you made a lot of headlines when you called for the 25th Amendment to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=297.8s)]
*  be invoked against President Trump. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=301.72s)]
*  How do you feel about that a year on? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=304.38s)]
*  Do you have any regrets for it? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=305.88s)]
*  Do you still stand by that, given everything that has played out since then? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=307.08s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=312.12s)]
*  It was really difficult. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=313.12s)]
*  I've actually done television in the past myself, but nothing will ever prepare you [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  for losing a loved one this way. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=318.36s)]
*  And we had every major media press publication and outlet in this country and seven or eight [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=321.64s)]
*  other countries contact us or try to contact us. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=327.32s)]
*  And the reason that I reached out to you is because I know you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=330.2s)]
*  All the other press that reached out to us, I didn't play soccer with them as a kid like [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=334.92s)]
*  I did with you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=340.6s)]
*  So for me, that was comforting. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=342.72s)]
*  Alana, on a national level, there hasn't really been any accountability for what happened [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=344.72s)]
*  that day. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=352.56s)]
*  Some of the low level rioters have been punished, but no one at the top has been held accountable. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  What would accountability look like to you and your family, to your parents, both for [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=360.0s)]
*  what happened to Roseanne, but also for the broader riot and insurrection itself? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=364.8s)]
*  Well, I think that the people that have been saying the big lie, the perpetrators and enablers [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=371.28s)]
*  of the big lie need to be stopped somehow. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=381.04s)]
*  You know, social media has made a huge platform for them to be able to spread all this disinformation [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=385.04s)]
*  and they're purposely targeting people. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=395.2s)]
*  So I just wish that there was a way that it could be stopped on a level of individual [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=397.6s)]
*  as well as... [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=405.04s)]
*  You know, what we really, I think, want to accomplish is to try to have something positive [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=407.04s)]
*  come from this and given the circumstances, that's going to be really hard to do. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=412.16s)]
*  But we don't want to see this happen again in our country. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=416.16s)]
*  We don't want this to happen to somebody else or to another family. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=420.16s)]
*  And I think that that's why we agreed to do the podcast to try to shed some light on Roseanne [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=424.88000000000005s)]
*  so that maybe there's other families out there or other people that could recognize this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=431.6s)]
*  or if they see something similar happening with another level. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=436.0s)]
*  But the main thing is, is we don't want this to happen again. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=438.8s)]
*  Yeah, and that's a really good point, Justin. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you definitely talk about trying to prevent this from happening again. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  And yet, to some extent, you have the Republican Party, which continues to downplay and brush [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=450.0s)]
*  January 6th under the rug. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=455.28s)]
*  Even some of the people who originally condemned Trump for what happened that day [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=457.52s)]
*  have backtracked. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=461.2s)]
*  And I'm sure you've seen them as well, some of his fellow Republican colleagues. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  Are you surprised by this? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=466.79999999999995s)]
*  And are you, as somebody who lost a loved one to this conspiracy theory, but at the same time, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  to the big lie, are you insulted by their attempts [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=475.84s)]
*  to downplay the event where Roseanne was killed? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=478.8s)]
*  You know, it is disheartening. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=482.64s)]
*  I'm glad to see that there's a January 6th committee. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  The last special committee that I can remember was Benghazi. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=487.36s)]
*  So to see congressional Republicans call this the unselect committee [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=491.36s)]
*  or to kind of shrug off congressional subpoenas is a little disheartening [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=495.44s)]
*  because I think that's the effort that we need to figure out what really happened here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=499.68s)]
*  But yeah, it is difficult. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=504.0s)]
*  Lana and I have watched so many hours of footage from that day, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=505.36s)]
*  so many hours of footage from the scene right there on the steps of the West Terrace [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  where Roseanne died. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=513.12s)]
*  It's hard to call it a peaceful protest. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=514.88s)]
*  And for us personally, we don't know what accountability looks like, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=519.76s)]
*  but we all have to try to work together to figure out how this happened, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=525.2s)]
*  why this happened, and what we're going to do to make sure that it doesn't happen again. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=530.16s)]
*  Lana, since the podcast came out, I know that there's been some new footage [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=535.6s)]
*  that has emerged in the area where Roseanne died in the tunnel there on the Capitol. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=539.44s)]
*  I know that you have been really spending a lot of time trying to piece together [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=545.6s)]
*  the final minutes of what happened to your sister. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=549.6s)]
*  Did you learn anything new from this footage that came out? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=553.44s)]
*  What does that reveal to you about her final minutes, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=556.48s)]
*  and does it bring you any closer to some of the answers that you're looking for? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=559.52s)]
*  It doesn't bring me any closer to the answers, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=565.36s)]
*  but I was very surprised to see her actually inside of the tunnel [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=567.84s)]
*  a lot further in than I had originally thought. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=573.44s)]
*  So that was really hard for me to see because she was so claustrophobic [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=578.16s)]
*  and hated people being around her. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  So even if she was just in the tunnel without a bunch of people, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=585.44s)]
*  that would be un-living people surrounding her. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  It was just so uncharacteristic of her, the sad, to see that something had that much power over her [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=593.52s)]
*  to think that that was necessary. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  Right, where she would end up on the steps of the Capitol building [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  during an electoral process on Riot Line that wasn't like Roseanne. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=608.88s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like so out of character for her from what I've learned from both of you [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=614.72s)]
*  and what we've learned over the past year. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  Has it changed your perception at all about her and what she believed, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=621.44s)]
*  when and why she went up to the Capitol on that day, Alana? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=625.44s)]
*  No, it doesn't change. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=631.2s)]
*  I know that Roseanne has always wanted to help people, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  and that's one of the things that I tell our daughters is, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=636.88s)]
*  one day I'll explain this to you, but all you need to know for right now [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=640.48s)]
*  is that Roseanne loved you so much [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=644.24s)]
*  and that she was trying to help you and other children. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=647.52s)]
*  So it doesn't change. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=654.9599999999999s)]
*  Roseanne was into this QAnon thing, and we hear these words lately on the news, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=658.4s)]
*  like radicalization or extremism, and I think that it's safe to say right now at this point [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=662.7199999999999s)]
*  in our country that we do have a problem with extremism, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=667.68s)]
*  and it's going to look different for different people. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=670.4799999999999s)]
*  Me personally, for the last year, I've been trying to wrestle with my own thoughts [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=673.76s)]
*  and emotions and feeling and anger even, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=677.3599999999999s)]
*  and I think that trauma for a lot of people can be a path to extremism, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  and we really just need to address some of the issues that we've been having as a country. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=684.64s)]
*  Moving forward, over the next couple years, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  we're going to move into the midterm elections and the next presidential election, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=692.8s)]
*  and I really wanted to say to everybody, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=696.8s)]
*  I have a lot of conservative friends and family, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=699.52s)]
*  and half of our family are conservative and half of our family aren't, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=702.0s)]
*  and my friends that are conservative think I'm liberal, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=705.3599999999999s)]
*  and my liberal and progressive friends think that I'm conservative, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=707.52s)]
*  but what I want to really say is whether you cast a vote for the Republican Party [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=710.8s)]
*  or for the Democratic Party, you're not talking about the enemy. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=715.04s)]
*  You're talking about your friends, your family members, your coworkers, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=718.16s)]
*  and your neighbors, and I think it's important that we all remember that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=721.5999999999999s)]
*  as we move forward together as a family or as a community and as a country over the next couple years. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=725.04s)]
*  Justin and Lana Cave, I just want to say thank you very much to you. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=732.56s)]
*  I know how difficult this time of year has been, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=736.24s)]
*  and thank you for letting me tell your story. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  At the same time, I do want to tell everyone, if you haven't already, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYaBVxiu48&t=742.0799999999999s)]
