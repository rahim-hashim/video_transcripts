# Rep. Melanie Stansbury: It’s Not Up to Dems to Bail Out McCarthy
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s)
*  Last few days and weeks, extreme-magic Republicans tried to walk away from that deal, voting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=0.0s)]
*  for deep, drastic spending cuts from 30 to 80 percent. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=8.96s)]
*  That would have been devastating for millions of Americans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=13.8s)]
*  They failed again. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=17.32s)]
*  They failed again. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=18.32s)]
*  And we stopped them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=19.56s)]
*  But I'm under no illusions that they'll be back again. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=21.44s)]
*  All right, so that was President Biden earlier today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=23.96s)]
*  Republicans led by Kevin McCarthy for now have just six weeks to get their act together [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=27.24s)]
*  and pass a long-term funding bill. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=32.52s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic congresswoman Melanie Stansberry of New Mexico. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=35.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=38.32s)]
*  Thanks for coming back on the show. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=39.72s)]
*  Let's start by talking about what the near future could look like for Speaker McCarthy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=42.6s)]
*  Would you support a motion to vacate him? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=47.24s)]
*  And do you think this is an attempt by Republicans to distract from the broader chaos within [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=49.28s)]
*  their party? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=54.16s)]
*  Well, it's absolutely an effort to distract from the complete lack of leadership and chaos [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=57.63999999999999s)]
*  that's happening within their party. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=63.04s)]
*  But I do think there are factions within the Republican conference that genuinely do want [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=65.16s)]
*  to take the speaker out. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=69.66s)]
*  But, you know, my message for McCarthy is it's not our circus and he's not our clown. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=71.24s)]
*  We stand united behind Hakeem Jeffries to be the next speaker. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=76.64s)]
*  And you know, it's not up to Democrats to bail him out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=81.36s)]
*  He's got to work it out within his own conference. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=85.0s)]
*  We don't even know what kind of procedural motions may come to the floor in the coming [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=87.08s)]
*  days or weeks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=90.52s)]
*  But it's really up to him to figure out how to manage his conference and for the members [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=91.52s)]
*  of that conference to have legitimate, serious leadership that's able to govern this country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=95.88s)]
*  Let me ask you about the short term spending bill. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=101.28s)]
*  Obviously, it does not include funding for Ukraine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=103.12s)]
*  That gave Democrats on the Senate side at least some pause there for a moment. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=105.64s)]
*  But the White House is focused on turning that around before mid-November. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=109.74s)]
*  Earlier today, President Biden said to stop playing games and actually get it done. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=114.2s)]
*  What would you like to see moving forward? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=119.48s)]
*  What does getting it done look like in the short term? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we need to bring a bipartisan effort to the floor very quickly to fund our [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=125.48s)]
*  aid to Ukraine. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=132.88s)]
*  It's very clear that Ukraine needs continued military support in its efforts to push back [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=134.56s)]
*  against the Russian invasion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=139.36s)]
*  And it's important for our democracy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=141.34s)]
*  I think what a lot of people need to understand is that this isn't just about Ukraine and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  the safety and the sovereignty of that country, which of course is very important, but it's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=148.76s)]
*  about the survival of Western democracy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=153.64s)]
*  And American engagement and support for Ukrainian efforts is vital to the future of global democracy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=157.04s)]
*  So we need to get a resolution to the House floor quickly and get that aid to Ukraine. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=163.44s)]
*  And of course, we recently saw the, you know, plenty of other Republican-manufactured chaos [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=169.0s)]
*  and perhaps most notably the House Oversight Committee holding its first impeachment inquiry [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=173.88s)]
*  hearing into Biden. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=179.36s)]
*  I was actually struck by some of the comments that you made, and I want to play just a brief [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=180.72s)]
*  part of your remarks from that hearing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=185.52s)]
*  Let's be clear about what this hearing actually is. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=189.96s)]
*  It's an effort to undermine our democracy, to diminish Donald Trump's own two impeachments. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  This is not a serious inquiry. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  This is not a serious hearing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  In fact, the witnesses here don't even believe there's enough evidence to impeach. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=208.16s)]
*  And you also, at the end of that clip, which we cut out, you pointed to the fact that members [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=213.48s)]
*  of the Republican Party did not even attend that hearing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=219.48s)]
*  So you really undercut a lot of their argument, but I just wanted you to expand on the first [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=224.08s)]
*  part of your remarks there, the part about this is a threat to our democracy and how [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=228.68s)]
*  it poses such a threat. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=233.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's very clear that this fake impeachment hearing is all about Donald Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=237.96s)]
*  It's very clear when you follow the evidence that Donald Trump called for an impeachment [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=244.36s)]
*  inquiry. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=248.52s)]
*  It's very clear on his own social media posts that the reason why he wants this impeachment [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  is to undermine the justice system, which is investigating him for criminal activity. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=254.16s)]
*  It's part of his own efforts to undermine his political opponent in the 2024 election. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=259.68s)]
*  And so in that way, it is part of Donald Trump's continued criminal pattern of trying to use [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=266.76s)]
*  our democratic institutions to put forward his own political agenda. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=272.72s)]
*  And after we saw the 2020 election, his efforts to foment an insurrection in the Capitol and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=279.24s)]
*  to steal an election, I think that it's very chilling. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=284.54s)]
*  It's part of his continued pattern to undermine our democracy and fair and free elections [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=288.02s)]
*  and to use the resources of the government to do so. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=293.02s)]
*  How does the road ahead look for Republicans who are trying to push this evidence free [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=296.5s)]
*  inquiry? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=300.74s)]
*  Do you think it will actually have a political cost? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=301.74s)]
*  Do you think that they and their constituents in their districts are so siloed off from [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=304.26s)]
*  the reality of America and what Americans really want from a governing party that it [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=309.26s)]
*  will not have any political consequence for them? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=314.38s)]
*  You know, I think it's clear that there is a portion of the GOP's base that is, as you [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=320.14s)]
*  say, very siloed off from broader media coverage. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=326.06s)]
*  But I think that what was on full display in the six-plus hours of that hearing was [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  a complete lack of evidence and seriousness. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  In fact, what was particularly strange about the hearing is that their own star witness [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=338.26s)]
*  in his opening statement in the first few minutes of his statement said, I do not personally [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=342.78s)]
*  believe that there is sufficient evidence to meet the standard of impeachment. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=348.46s)]
*  You know, I was like, OK, great, let's gavel and get this thing over with. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=353.46s)]
*  Why are we even holding this hearing? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=356.74s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say that— [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=358.82s)]
*  So, you know, I think it was very evident that they don't have evidence. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=359.82s)]
*  Yeah, sorry, not to speak over you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=362.3s)]
*  I just meant to—it's crazy to think that Jonathan Turley, who has become the darling [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  of everything the Republicans want to do with any legal justification, is literally coming [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=367.98s)]
*  out and saying, I don't think this actually raises to the level of impeachment inquiry. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  Congresswoman Melanie Stansberry, it's always a pleasure. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time for us this week. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  I know it's been very busy for you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJaHgj7O_s&t=381.86s)]
