# The media’s hypocritical hysteria over campus protests
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI)
*  Israat University, Gaza's youngest university, was established in 2014 with a simple goal, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=0.0s)]
*  ensuring poverty would not stand in the way of any Palestinian that wanted to pursue a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=9.44s)]
*  college degree. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=14.36s)]
*  Israat was known for its towering main building and archway entrance, constructed as a love [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=15.68s)]
*  letter to Islamic architecture. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=21.56s)]
*  The university was actually set to mark its 10th anniversary this year, and to celebrate [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=24.3s)]
*  that milestone, the school planned to open a public museum on campus housing more than [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=28.26s)]
*  3,000 artifacts, including relics from the Roman Empire to more modern pieces of Palestinian [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=33.620000000000005s)]
*  history and culture. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=40.7s)]
*  However, Israat University and all of the history it housed within its walls has now [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  been destroyed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=48.660000000000004s)]
*  On January 17th, the Israeli Defense Forces demolished the university's main building, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=50.58s)]
*  reducing it to rubble in a matter of seconds. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=55.62s)]
*  Israeli military initially tried to justify this action, claiming that the campus had [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=59.58s)]
*  been, quote, used by Hamas for military activity and that there were concerns the group might [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=63.419999999999995s)]
*  use it to attack Israeli forces. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  But later, the Israeli military admitted there had been flaws in the operational process, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=72.88s)]
*  including in the decision to destroy the entire building. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=78.5s)]
*  However, Israat University was not alone in Gaza. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=82.34s)]
*  According to an NBC News analysis, at least five of Gaza's seven major universities have [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=85.74s)]
*  been destroyed or damaged since Israel began its bombardment of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=90.74s)]
*  And as Professor Rashid Khalidi, a historian at Columbia University, noted, quote, when [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=96.34s)]
*  you destroy these kinds of institutions, you are not fighting Hamas. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=100.46s)]
*  You are fighting the existence of the Palestinians. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=104.7s)]
*  You are fighting their capability to have memory, to have records, and to be educated. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=107.34s)]
*  UN experts are now sounding the alarm, expressing concern that these attacks on universities [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=113.54s)]
*  in Gaza are part of a much larger effort to comprehensively destroy the Palestinian education [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=118.7s)]
*  system, an action known as scholasticide. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=124.66s)]
*  For almost seven months, the war has halted the studies of at least 88,000 students, according [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=128.82s)]
*  to the Palestinian authorities Ministry of Higher Education. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=134.9s)]
*  But if you've turned on television here in America, it is apparently American universities [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=139.22s)]
*  that are under attack. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  As pro-Palestinian anti-war protests continue to spread to college campuses across the country, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=146.3s)]
*  coverage of these demonstrations has dominated mainstream media. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=152.34s)]
*  Here's just a really small glimpse at how these protesters have been described. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=161.5s)]
*  That's what this looks like to me. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=165.46s)]
*  This might look like January 6th, but it's a thousand times worse. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=167.1s)]
*  Charlottesville was a little peanut, and the hate wasn't the kind of hate that you have here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=171.38s)]
*  Harkening back to the 1930s in Europe, and I do not say that lightly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=175.62s)]
*  Keep marching for Hamas, kids. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=179.82s)]
*  This is not what students bring to school. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  Hamas is here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  Even the notion of an encampment is a physical threat. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=185.86s)]
*  We have a terrorist group marching in New York right now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=189.22s)]
*  They're dumb and or unattractive. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=192.5s)]
*  Take it to the bank. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=194.98s)]
*  They have been brainwashed by TikTok to believe that Israel's actually committing a genocide. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=195.98s)]
*  What's happening on college campuses is rooted in anti-Semitism. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=201.42s)]
*  They are embracing the rhetoric and the ideology of Hamas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=205.66s)]
*  Does that negotiating with terrorists work for them? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=210.58s)]
*  We are going to have fascism as a result of these protests. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=212.98s)]
*  We are going to have fascism as a result of these protests. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=217.02s)]
*  It's absolute hysteria from the media. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=220.66000000000003s)]
*  Outrage over protesters setting up tents, occupying buildings or breaking windows. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=223.34s)]
*  As Gaza's entire education system lies in ruins. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  U.S. media have become obsessed with this manufactured idea of violence sweeping across [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=233.5s)]
*  American campuses, all while failing to cover the very real violence that has decimated [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=239.78s)]
*  an entire generation's access to education. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=245.82000000000002s)]
*  The media isn't doing this alone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=249.66s)]
*  Here in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has given them an assist, making himself, as the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  nation's Jeet here describes, the public face of the nationwide campus crackdown on pro-Palestinian [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=256.3s)]
*  activism. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=262.54s)]
*  At a press conference this week, Adams attempted to rationalize the NYPD's crackdown on Columbia [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=263.54s)]
*  University, claiming he's preventing young people from being, quote, radicalized by professionals. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=268.26s)]
*  New York City Police Deputy Commissioner Tariq Shepard has gone in on the baseless fear-mongering [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=274.7s)]
*  as well, touting bike chains. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=279.58s)]
*  Yeah, bike chains. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=282.02s)]
*  Literally bike chains sold at a discount by Columbia University as some kind of sinister [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=283.54s)]
*  weapon that has been brought in by outsiders. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=289.66s)]
*  If you want to talk about sinister weapons inflicting mass destruction on a campus, what [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=292.5s)]
*  about the 300-plus mines that the Israeli military used to blow up Asraat University [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=298.9s)]
*  back in January? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=303.66s)]
*  It's as simple as this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=305.86s)]
*  You cannot claim to be worried about violence at universities, about disruptions to students' [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=307.36s)]
*  education, about safety on college campuses, and ignore what is taking place in Gaza. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  You cannot be more concerned about the act of students protesting than you are with the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=319.48s)]
*  very issues that they're protesting against, and what the UN Special Rapporteur on Human [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=324.44s)]
*  Rights has described as a genocide. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOn7r5iXbI&t=329.8s)]
