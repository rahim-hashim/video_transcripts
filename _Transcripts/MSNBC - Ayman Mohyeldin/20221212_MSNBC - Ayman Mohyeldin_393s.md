# Rep. Mondaire Jones On The Respect For Marriage Act, And What’s Next After His Term In Congress Ends
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc)
*  This week, the House of Representatives passed the Respect for Marriage Act, which would [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=0.0s)]
*  guarantee federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages, 258 to 169. It [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=8.2s)]
*  now heads to President Biden's desk for signature. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=14.32s)]
*  The legislation was spearheaded in the Senate by Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin, the first openly [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=17.66s)]
*  gay elected to the Senate, gay person elected to the Senate. Excuse me. It is no doubt a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  win for LGBTQ rights, but the bill does have its limitations. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=26.659999999999997s)]
*  Notably, it allows religious organizations to deny services to LGBTQ couples according to their [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=31.54s)]
*  personal beliefs. Joining me now to discuss this and much more is Democratic Congressman Mondare [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=38.04s)]
*  Jones of New York. Congressman, it's always great to see you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=43.66s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming back on the show. Your thoughts on the Respect for Marriage Act. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=46.42s)]
*  It's great to be with you, Eamon. And this is an incredible achievement. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=52.78s)]
*  I'm really proud of what we've been able to do in the United States Congress. We even got a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=56.06s)]
*  filibuster-proof majority over in the Senate. When does that happen? And this is to do something [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=61.7s)]
*  that when I was growing up, I never imagined was possible, which is ensure marriage equality for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=65.98s)]
*  all the states that currently allow same-sex and interracial marriages to be performed under [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=71.26s)]
*  state law. I'm really excited about this. We've got a lot of more work to do. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=76.06s)]
*  You mentioned some of the challenges. Another challenge is that this still does not ensure [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=80.02s)]
*  marriage equality in every single state in the union. And we've got to go further than what we've [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=85.46s)]
*  done thus far for that reason. I think some of us who have been following the story closely say the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=90.82s)]
*  alarm bells started to go off for the push to pass the Respect for Marriage Act after Justice [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=95.94s)]
*  Thomas's concurring opinion when the court overturned Roe v. Wade, because there was this part [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=102.02s)]
*  where he said the court should revisit cases that established the right to same-sex marriages and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=107.61999999999999s)]
*  relationships. And look, we know this country well. That is a signal to somebody out there to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=112.58s)]
*  bring litigation forward that could bring its way up to the Supreme Court. Are you afraid the court [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=118.02s)]
*  will in fact take that step or try to take that step now that Clarence Thomas has signaled that he [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=122.34s)]
*  wants to see that, more or less? In fact, that was the impetus for this legislation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=128.18s)]
*  We saw in Justice Thomas's concurring opinion in Dobs that there are going to be a number of other [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=133.7s)]
*  rights that are taken away from millions of Americans in the same way that this far-right [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=139.54s)]
*  6-3 supermajority on the court stripped away the fundamental right to an abortion that had existed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=143.94s)]
*  for 50 years in our Constitution. And so we wanted to get ahead of the problem, and we did that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=148.73999999999998s)]
*  But we also know that there are other things on the chopping block, the right to contraception, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=154.66s)]
*  the right to so many other things that we simply take for granted in our everyday lives. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=160.42s)]
*  These are the problems that you have because the right has stacked the court with radical extremists, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=165.05999999999997s)]
*  Mitch McConnell, for example, denying Obama the ability to appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  Court. Now we've got a 6-3 hyperpartisan majority that does not care about its own precedence even. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=180.1s)]
*  And we see that in terms of relief that it's provided, as well as marriage equality in the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=186.5s)]
*  Gormanville-Burgerfell and other things that it's been doing. We expect these decisions to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=192.58s)]
*  be rolled back in the next few years, unfortunately. ALEJANDRO CORDERO Let's shift to the National [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=196.74s)]
*  Defense Authorization Act. The House passed the NDA this week, and it set a record $858 billion [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=202.10000000000002s)]
*  next year for military spending, I believe $45 billion more than what the White House [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=209.86s)]
*  was asking for in this budget. Was that necessary? MICHAEL BOOTH No, it wasn't. I hear a lot of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=214.82000000000002s)]
*  concerned about inflation in this country. I share their perspective. And in the same way that I [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=222.58s)]
*  voted against the NDAA last year, I voted against it this time around. The NDAA is a holiday for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=227.54s)]
*  lobbyists in Washington on K Street. It has so many things in it that have nothing to do with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=235.3s)]
*  the defense of our country. And it's why I've shown the political courage to vote against it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=241.22s)]
*  time and time again. Americans want to make sure, obviously, that our military has the resources [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=246.58s)]
*  that it has. But as you just mentioned, we just gave, in the form of the NDAA, $45 billion more [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=251.78s)]
*  than the president even requested. And we all know that the president is going to request more [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=258.74s)]
*  than he already needs, so that he has some extra and some flexibility to do with it, as he will, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=262.5s)]
*  to protect our borders and to defend our nation against threats, both foreign and domestic. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=268.66s)]
*  But what we see here is the fact that special interests have a chokehold [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=274.58s)]
*  over the United States Congress. And we have to start showing the political courage to get away [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=279.46000000000004s)]
*  from that. — Congressman, before we go, I want to discuss your time in Congress. You talk about [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=284.42s)]
*  political courage. Unfortunately, your time as a congressman is coming up, I think, probably, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=290.74s)]
*  because of political courage and the way you decided to run your race and where you decided [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=295.06s)]
*  to run it. But let me ask you, what is your proudest moment of your time in office? What do you hope [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=300.1s)]
*  to do next? — I appreciate that opportunity. Obviously, redistricting has been a nightmare [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=305.14s)]
*  in New York State in particular, and it cost us the House, which has been to the detriment of our [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=312.02s)]
*  democracy. I've done a lot of things as a fresher member of Congress. One of the things I'm most [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  proud of is having bridged the divides that existed in our caucus at the time to pass the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  largest investment in our nation's infrastructure that we've seen in generations. And then, of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  course, I'm proud also to have just helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which is going to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=331.3s)]
*  cap the price of prescription drugs for our seniors on Medicare, like my grandmother, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=334.82s)]
*  which is one of the reasons I ran for Congress in the first place, as well as investing climate [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  action in the way this nation hasn't ever seen. I'm excited to keep doing the work of saving our [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=342.58s)]
*  democracy, and I'm keeping an eye towards the future as well. — Well, we hope we get to see [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=347.78s)]
*  more of you on this network. And I don't want to say we hope to see you run again, but if you [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=353.94s)]
*  decide to get back in the ring, you'll certainly have a fan in me, my friend. Congressman [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=359.62s)]
*  Mondaire-Jones, always a pleasure. Thank you so much for your time, sir. — Thank you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=364.42s)]
*  you [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ0otIl4Rc&t=389.62s)]
