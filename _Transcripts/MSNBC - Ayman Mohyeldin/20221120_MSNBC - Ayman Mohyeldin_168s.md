# Underwhelming Midterms Performance Sparks GOP Blame Game
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I)
*  Let the finger-pointing begin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=0.0s)]
*  Fresh off a disastrous midterms performance, a civil war is brewing inside the Republican [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=5.4s)]
*  Party with one common theme. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=10.16s)]
*  The current leaders are failing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=12.6s)]
*  This week, Kevin McCarthy won his party's nomination for speaker 188 to 31, beating [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=14.44s)]
*  out a challenge from the conservative House Freedom Caucus. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=19.14s)]
*  He only needed a simple majority to win that vote. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=22.44s)]
*  But in January, on the House floor, he'll have to bump that number up to 218 to officially [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=24.7s)]
*  take the gavel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=29.98s)]
*  Complicating that path, at least four Republicans have already publicly signaled they will not [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=31.18s)]
*  support him. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Now, depending on how small the Republican majority is in the House, McCarthy might not [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  have enough votes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=41.74s)]
*  In the Senate, Mitch McConnell faced his first major leadership challenge. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=43.260000000000005s)]
*  McConnell beat out Florida Senator Rick Scott, who ran the Chamber's campaign arm this cycle [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=47.38s)]
*  by 37 to 10. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=52.7s)]
*  McConnell and Scott blame each other for the party's midterm losses and have been airing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=54.5s)]
*  out their dirty laundry in public. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=58.02s)]
*  Clearly, though, this isn't the post-election period Republicans had in mind. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=59.900000000000006s)]
*  To make matters worse, as he always does, Donald Trump announced his 2024 presidential [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=64.7s)]
*  bid this week, and despite pleas from party officials to wait until after the Georgia [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=69.34s)]
*  runoff next month, because Trump bore the brunt of the blame for the GOP's midterm failures, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=74.42s)]
*  as Mitch McConnell put it, quote, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  We underperformed among independents and moderates because their impression of many of the people [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=81.9s)]
*  in our party and leadership roles is that they are involved in chaos, negativity, excessive [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=86.98s)]
*  attacks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  I never thought I would say that, but he is. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Across the country, voters in key battleground states firmly rejected Trumpism. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=97.42s)]
*  Trump-backed election deniers lost races for pivotal positions in places like Michigan, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=101.78s)]
*  Arizona, and Nevada. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=106.38000000000001s)]
*  But what makes this even more fun to discuss? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=107.98s)]
*  Republicans did this to themselves. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=111.62s)]
*  Two years ago, Mitch McConnell could have arguably stopped all of this in its tracks [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=113.44s)]
*  by leading his party to convict Donald Trump in his impeachment trial over the January [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=117.86s)]
*  6th attack. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=123.14s)]
*  That would have barred Trump from running for office ever again, possibly freeing the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=124.62s)]
*  GOP from his influence. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=129.22s)]
*  That's not what happened. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=130.94s)]
*  Instead, Mitch McConnell and the majority of the Republicans, they chose to stick with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=133.02s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=137.82s)]
*  And now they are suffering the consequences. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNi4K-yNd0I&t=139.22s)]
