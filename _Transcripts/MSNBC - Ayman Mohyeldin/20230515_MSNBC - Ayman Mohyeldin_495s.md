# North Carolina Attorney General on his state’s democracy problem
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g)
*  Late last month, I should note, in one field swoop, the North Carolina Supreme Court took [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=0.0s)]
*  an axe to American democracy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=8.16s)]
*  On April 28, the newly Republican-controlled court issued three major decisions, each further [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=10.44s)]
*  chipping away at voting rights in the state. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=16.62s)]
*  There is Harper v. Hall, which has essentially greenlit partisan gerrymandering, Holmes v. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=20.0s)]
*  Moore, which reinstated a strict photo ID policy, and Community Success Initiative v. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=25.76s)]
*  Moore, which upheld the state's felony disenfranchisement law. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=31.76s)]
*  Now, if any of those cases sound familiar, that is because the first two were already [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  decided by the court just a short time ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=40.6s)]
*  But when Republicans gained a 5-2 majority on the bench in the 2022 midterm elections, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=42.92s)]
*  GOP lawmakers asked for a do-over, even though none of the facts surrounding those cases [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  had changed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=54.94s)]
*  In a scathing dissent to Harper, one of the court's liberal justices, Anita Earls, called [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=56.1s)]
*  out her colleagues for their, quote, shameful manipulation of fundamental principles of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  our democracy and the rule of law. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=65.02s)]
*  She went on to write, quote, I look forward to the day when commitment to the constitutional [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=68.18s)]
*  principles of free elections and equal protection of the laws are upheld and the abuses committed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=71.82s)]
*  by the majority are recognized for what they are, permanently relegating them to the annals [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=77.7s)]
*  of the court's darkest moments. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=83.86s)]
*  I have no doubt that day will come. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=85.94s)]
*  Here to discuss this, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=89.3s)]
*  He is also running to be the state's next governor in 2024. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=92.82s)]
*  Attorney General Stein, it's great to have you back on the show. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=96.74s)]
*  Thank you for making time for us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=98.9s)]
*  So talk to us about the implications here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=100.38s)]
*  What do these decisions themselves mean for voters in your state, for those that may not [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=102.9s)]
*  know? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=107.34s)]
*  Benjamin, it's a pleasure to be with you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=108.34s)]
*  We're at a troubling moment here in North Carolina. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=111.18s)]
*  We are at the center of our fight for freedoms, whether it's reproductive freedoms or folks' [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=114.05999999999999s)]
*  voting rights. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=119.41999999999999s)]
*  We had a big win last year. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=120.41999999999999s)]
*  It was in December. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=122.41999999999999s)]
*  We argued, my office, along with the governor and some plaintiffs, had argued to the North [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  Carolina Supreme Court that partisan gerrymandering violates our state constitution, violates a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=128.7s)]
*  number of our declared rights, free elections, equal protection, and others. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=133.62s)]
*  And struck down the old maps, which were highly partisan gerrymandered. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=138.5s)]
*  In fact, they would have produced a congressional delegation of 10 to 4 or 11 to 3. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  The court ordered them to draw new maps. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=148.5s)]
*  The court came up with maps. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=150.62s)]
*  And we have now a delegation of seven Democrats and seven Republicans, which were a 50-50 [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=152.14s)]
*  state. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=157.38s)]
*  The only thing that changed from that decision in December to today is an election and two [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  new justices were seated to the North Carolina Supreme Court. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=165.94s)]
*  So the Republican legislators petitioned the court to get that decision reconsidered. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=168.94s)]
*  That was a radical request because usually when courts reconsider decisions that they've [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  made, it's because there's been a change in the law from the U.S. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=178.58s)]
*  Supreme Court or some severe factual misunderstanding by the court that needed correction. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=181.46s)]
*  Neither of those things happened. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=187.74s)]
*  The only thing that happened was two Republican justices took their seats. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=189.06s)]
*  It is an absolute offense to the rule of law that they have thrown out the old decision [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=193.46s)]
*  and now have empowered our Republican supermajorities to engage in the most brazen partisan gerrymanders [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=198.06s)]
*  here in North Carolina. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=205.22s)]
*  You have a better pulse. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  You have a better sense of the pulse of voters in your state. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  What do voters in North Carolina make of this blatant partisanship of the court? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=211.78s)]
*  I mean, how do they see this impacting their democracy? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  And do they share the concerns that you've outlined? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=220.38s)]
*  There's no question that voters are incredibly concerned. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  They not only threw out these voting cases, they threw out a public school financing case [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  that ordered the legislature to finally uphold our constitutional mandate to ensure that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=232.46s)]
*  everybody has a sound basic education. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=239.42s)]
*  The court just threw it out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=241.94s)]
*  And so folks are incredibly distressed and realize that this court has completely shaken [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=243.42s)]
*  our understanding what the rule of law is meant to be. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=249.46s)]
*  You said you're concerned obviously about the freedom and you said this is an assault [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=254.06s)]
*  on freedom. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=256.74s)]
*  How worried are you about the state of democracy in North Carolina? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=257.74s)]
*  Unfortunately, we are always at the center of voting rights struggles here in this country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=262.42s)]
*  And the fight is still going on. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=269.38s)]
*  We know that there are going to be some ugly maps that the General Assembly produces, but [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=272.28s)]
*  honestly, the Senate had been elected under unconstitutional maps the last go round in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=276.1s)]
*  So we've been fighting these fights for really the past decade and a half and we will keep [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=282.74s)]
*  fighting. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=289.06s)]
*  There are so many of us here in North Carolina who care fundamentally that the power belong [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=290.3s)]
*  to the people, that we as individuals have power in this government, not the politicians [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=295.62s)]
*  and that people should choose their representatives, not the other way around. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=301.86s)]
*  And we're going to keep fighting and keep fighting until we win. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=305.18s)]
*  Let's talk about two things you mentioned. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=309.06s)]
*  The 12 week abortion ban passed by the state legislator was just vetoed by the Democratic [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=311.3s)]
*  Governor Roy Cooper. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=316.38s)]
*  But as you also mentioned, the Republican supermajority may be able to override his [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=317.38s)]
*  decision if they get enough votes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=321.82s)]
*  Talk about that process and what the outcome might mean for women in your state. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=325.06s)]
*  Do you believe there will be any Republicans who may develop a conscience before that vote [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  and actually not vote with the supermajority? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=334.53999999999996s)]
*  We certainly hope so. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  I was with the governor and about 2500 other North Carolinians on Saturday when he vetoed [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=340.94s)]
*  that bill. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=346.06s)]
*  There are four Republican members of the legislature, House and Senate, who in their campaign in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=347.66s)]
*  2022 said that they did not want to restrict women's reproductive rights here in North [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=353.06s)]
*  Carolina. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=358.5s)]
*  Obviously, this is a dramatic reduction to people's freedom and restriction on their [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=359.5s)]
*  ability to make these decisions for themselves. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=364.66s)]
*  So we are urging every North Carolinian, contact every Republican member of the General Assembly [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=367.38s)]
*  in the House and the Senate and urge them to respect people's fundamental freedoms and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=372.82s)]
*  sustain the governor's veto. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  We're not naive. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=381.62s)]
*  We know it's a long shot, but we're going to fight and fight and fight and urge folks [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=382.62s)]
*  to reach out to the members of the legislature. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=386.94s)]
*  Let me ask you a political question, Ken. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=390.18s)]
*  As I mentioned, Mr. Attorney General, you are running for governor. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=391.98s)]
*  One of your declared Republican opponents is the current lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=396.26000000000005s)]
*  This is a man who has brutally smeared school shooting survivors, has called LGBTQ people [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=400.1s)]
*  quote filth. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=405.38s)]
*  How do you feel about having a man like that so close to the governor's mansion? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=406.74s)]
*  What do you plan to do about it? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=410.66s)]
*  Well, I'm troubled that he says these things that are so hateful about other human beings. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  It's absolutely contrary to the way a leader is supposed to be. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=419.26s)]
*  You're supposed to represent every North Carolinian, those you agree with and those you [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=423.06s)]
*  disagree with. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=427.62s)]
*  He does not do that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=429.34s)]
*  I'm incredibly troubled about the prospect of his becoming governor because he has made [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=431.1s)]
*  it absolutely clear, clear that he wants a total ban on abortion in North Carolina. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=434.66s)]
*  And if he wins the governorship, along with a willing legislature, that could be the next [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=440.62s)]
*  step of what happens in North Carolina. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=446.94s)]
*  And so I am all in to win this race because I want to be there for the people of North [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=448.98s)]
*  Carolina and ensure that they have the right to live their lives the way that they want, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=453.58000000000004s)]
*  not have Republican politicians in Raleigh dictate how they go about their lives. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, it's always a pleasure, sir. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=463.38s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=466.02000000000004s)]
*  Greatly appreciate it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=467.06s)]
*  Amen. Thank you. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxmBXat-3g&t=468.82s)]
