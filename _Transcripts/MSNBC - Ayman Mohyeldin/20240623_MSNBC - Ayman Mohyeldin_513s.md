# Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha on survival & poetry in Gaza
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk)
*  The Palestinian people have a long tradition of producing poets. It's played an important role [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=0.0s)]
*  in preserving their history, but also a tool of resistance and survival. Those in the literary [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=5.04s)]
*  and educational fields have not been spared the brutality of the past eight months. In December, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=10.32s)]
*  Literary Hub published a remembrance of 14 Palestinian poets and writers killed by Israel [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=17.12s)]
*  since October 7th, though that list has not been updated in months. In April, U.N. experts decried [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  the systematic obliteration of Gaza's education system and used the term scholasticide to describe [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=28.32s)]
*  it. One survivor is Mosab Abdu'l-Tawah, a poet, scholar, and founder of the Edward Said Library, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=35.2s)]
*  Gaza's first English language library named after the celebrated Palestinian American scholar. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=41.44s)]
*  On November 19th, Abdu'l-Tawah was detained by Israeli forces on his way to the Rafah border as [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=48.24s)]
*  he tried to evacuate with his family. He recounted his brutal detention in the New Yorker magazine [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=54.24s)]
*  where his writing has been featured. It was this notoriety in Western intellectual circles [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=59.84s)]
*  that prompted international outrage and spurred Israel to finally release him. Most Palestinians, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=65.76s)]
*  though, don't have that benefit. Since his release, he has been documenting what has been happening in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=71.68s)]
*  his native land from afar with painful stories of dead family members and friends and the destruction [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=77.44s)]
*  of his home. Mosab has a new book coming out in October. It's a collection of poems called [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=83.44s)]
*  Forest of Noise. He joins me now. Mosab, thank you so much for joining us on the show. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=88.96s)]
*  I want to start by asking you about your constant documentation of Israel's bombardment and war on [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=94.48s)]
*  Gaza and the intensely deteriorating conditions that the Palestinian people are still enduring [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=99.6s)]
*  in Gaza. Over the past few days, you have shared posts on X about an enormous massacre at the Shati [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=105.68s)]
*  refugee camp where you were born and you wrote just hours ago, our souls are not heavy. They are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=112.4s)]
*  very light. Please stop turning off the lights. Elaborate on what you mean and what's been going [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  through your mind over the last day alone. I mean, it's very devastating. Thank you so much [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=123.92s)]
*  for having me, Ayman. So very devastating for me that this massacre is happening while right now I'm [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  in Syracuse in New York state. It's very devastating to be outside of Gaza to watch my [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=135.2s)]
*  people being killed because I was nearly killed. I was detained. I mean, in fact, I was kidnapped, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  not detained because I was cleared to leave Gaza with my wife and three children. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  It's very devastating for me to watch my family looking for food. I mean, walking out in the street [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=153.2s)]
*  with, I mean, it's so difficult for people and it's very dangerous and risky for people to go out [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=158.48s)]
*  in the street to look for food. One time my mother and my sibling and his children just went out to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=163.76s)]
*  our bombed house in Bet Laia to dig through the rubble and see if they could find food in my [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  apartment. And the only thing that they could find were some books to the extent that I wish that I [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=177.76s)]
*  had food on my bookshelves instead of books. Today's massacre happened in a Shati refugee camp, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  one of the seven refugee camps in the Gulf Strip. There are just hundreds of thousands of people in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=190.0s)]
*  a just very tiny place that's called a Shati refugee camp, which is, which Shati means beach camp. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=195.92s)]
*  So this city, the Gulf Strip itself is on the shore. It's on the beach and people are just looking [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=201.84s)]
*  outside of their bombed houses into the sea. They wish they could just go to the sea and fish for [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=209.44s)]
*  food. But Israel has been maintaining a blockade on the sea, on the sky and on land, and fishermen [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=215.68s)]
*  are unable to go and fish. I mean, it's been going on since 2007. No fisherman could fish as far as [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  seven nautical miles. And now it's very dangerous even to go to the beach itself. So it's very [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  devastating to see my people starved by the Israeli occupation, to see my neighborhood in Bet Laia [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  bombed, and now to see the refugee camp where I was born to be bombed and to see some of the faces [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=242.72s)]
*  that I could recognize when I was a child. Let me ask you about one of the poems that you've [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=247.76s)]
*  written. And certainly you've written many poems over the last eight months, including this one [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=252.8s)]
*  called We Deserve a Better Death. Can you talk about this particular poem? I mean, the feelings [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=257.68s)]
*  you had while you were writing it and your hope for how it resonates with people? I mean, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=263.04s)]
*  are you writing these poems to help yourself process and grieve what is happening? Or are these [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=269.6s)]
*  more intended for the world into some kind of action or reaction? So I write poems in English [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=275.36s)]
*  and in Arabic, and this poem appeared in my first poetry collection that I wrote in the English [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=283.6s)]
*  language in 2022. So I mean, when I come back to read this poem, for example, which is part of the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=287.44s)]
*  book that was published two years ago, when I look at this poem, I feel like I've written it yesterday. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=292.56s)]
*  So this in itself tells us that the misery and the disaster that the Palestinians have been [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=297.76s)]
*  going through is a decade-long occupation. So when I wrote that poem, when I write poems in English, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=303.84s)]
*  it's like I'm talking to someone who doesn't know exactly how I live as a refugee, as a father, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=311.76s)]
*  as a displaced person right now. I mean, I had to leave Gaza not because I wanted to save my own [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=317.44s)]
*  life, but because I wanted to save the lives of my wife and three children. And I had the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=322.88s)]
*  opportunity to leave. And when I read this poem about us deserving a better death, not even [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=328.24s)]
*  deserving a better life, I mean, because we are living under occupation, at least if we are living [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=334.88s)]
*  under occupation, I mean, at least we need to die just a natural death. We don't have to have our [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=340.32s)]
*  faces, our heads cut off. Just today I posted something on Instagram, and unfortunately, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  Meta continues to remove my posts when I try to show the people in the world what Israel is doing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=352.23999999999995s)]
*  to us. They are not bombing only houses. They are not killing a family. They are killing people who [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=360.08s)]
*  live in the same neighborhood. So there was a photo of a young girl, and I could see her hair. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  There was only the head, even part of the head. And someone just put onto into that same blanket [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=371.44s)]
*  what remained of her feet, and Meta removed it. So we deserve a better death. Okay, if we are going [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=377.92s)]
*  to be killed, let us be killed just maybe by a bullet or something, but not for our bodies to be [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=387.44s)]
*  thrown around under the rubble. I mean, Israel is not only killing the houses, they are killing [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=394.0s)]
*  whoever is inside, as if these flesh and blood and bones were part of the construction of the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=398.96s)]
*  house itself. This is very brutal. This is unbearable, and it should be stopped today and now. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=405.84s)]
*  Mosab, we're almost out of time. We don't have a lot of time left, but I want to ask you, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=412.4s)]
*  since you kind of brought up the censorship of things that you're posting, you're able to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  consume Western news. You live now here in New York. What do you think the Western world or [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=419.2s)]
*  American media, social media is getting wrong or doesn't know about Gaza? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=425.68s)]
*  I think most people, when they think about Palestine, and especially here when we're talking [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  about Gaza, they think that Gaza is just a heap of rubble. No, Gaza is a very beautiful place. It has [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=436.96s)]
*  strawberry farms. It has beautiful buildings. And sometimes the Israelis would, you know, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=442.4s)]
*  when I post something beautiful about Gaza, they say, oh, how do you say you are under siege? We [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  are not occupying you. You see how healthy you looked in the past, as if they were feeding us. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=450.64s)]
*  No, we created Gaza to be a beautiful place, although we have been under siege, although we [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=455.04s)]
*  live under occupation for decades. The whole world needs to know that Gaza is just like any other [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=459.76000000000005s)]
*  city, and people want to live, and they don't want anyone to control them or to, you know, they want [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  to be free people of the world. They do not want this genocide to end, but they need freedom. They [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  need a state to live in, in freedom, in security, just like any other people in the world. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=478.48s)]
*  Musaba Batoa, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you so much for your poetry. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=484.64s)]
*  Always a pleasure. Thank you so much. Thank you, Ayman. Appreciate the time. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqA9j7iPhk&t=488.88s)]
