# The ultimate guide to the Trump-Daniels saga
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA)
*  To understand this moment that Donald Trump finds himself in, you have to understand how [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=0.0s)]
*  we got here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=8.8s)]
*  So, we want to take you back in time to 2006 and go through the major actions that Donald [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=9.8s)]
*  Trump and his associates took to bring him to the precipice of a possible indictment, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  starting with July 2006. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=20.84s)]
*  According to an interview Stormy Daniels would give to 60 Minutes, in 2018, Daniels meets [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=22.0s)]
*  Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=28.32s)]
*  She says he invited her to dinner and she met him at his hotel suite where they had [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=30.76s)]
*  sex. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=35.36s)]
*  Daniels is 27. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=36.36s)]
*  At the time, Trump is 60. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=37.6s)]
*  In May 2011, Stormy Daniels gives an interview to In Touch Magazine describing her encounter [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=39.78s)]
*  with Trump in exchange for $15,000. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  Two employees later tell CBS News that the interview never ran because Michael Cohen, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=48.52s)]
*  Trump's attorney at the time, threatened to sue when the publication asked Trump for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=53.04s)]
*  comment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=57.64s)]
*  And then we get to 2016 and Trump's run for president. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=58.64s)]
*  In June of that year, Karen McDougall, an actress and former Playboy model, begins trying [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=62.36s)]
*  to sell her story of an alleged affair she had with Trump in 2006 and 2007. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=66.96s)]
*  She retains attorney Keith Davidson, who approaches the National Enquirer about a possible [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=72.72s)]
*  deal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=76.72s)]
*  On August 5th, the National Enquirer secures the rights to McDougall's account for $150,000 [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=77.72s)]
*  but never publishes her story. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=83.48s)]
*  And federal prosecutors later say the agreement was meant to suppress her story so as to prevent [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=86.16s)]
*  it from influencing the election. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=92.12s)]
*  On October 8th, Stormy Daniels is now also represented by Keith Davidson, who tells the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer that she's willing to go on the record about her [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  alleged affair. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=104.84s)]
*  That news travels to Michael Cohen and Cohen negotiates a deal to pay Daniels $130,000 [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=106.56s)]
*  in exchange for the rights to her story and a non-disclosure agreement. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=113.4s)]
*  On October 27th, Cohen wires $130,000 to Stormy Daniels' attorney. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=118.4s)]
*  On November 8th, Trump's elected president, in the same month he is inaugurated, January [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=123.68s)]
*  2017, Michael Cohen seeks reimbursement from the Trump Organization for that payment he [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=129.04s)]
*  made to Stormy Daniels. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=135.48s)]
*  Then we fast forward a year. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=137.92s)]
*  On October 13th, 2018, Michael Cohen acknowledges making the payment to Stormy Daniels for the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=139.88s)]
*  first time but denies being reimbursed and says it was not connected to the Trump campaign, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=144.84s)]
*  both assertions he would later recant. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=151.86s)]
*  On March 6th, Daniels, who is now represented by attorney Michael Avenatti, sues Trump and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=155.72s)]
*  essential consultants LLC in California in an attempt to nullify her NDA, arguing that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=161.86s)]
*  the deal is invalid since Trump never signed it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=167.86s)]
*  On August 21st of that year, Cohen pleads guilty to eight federal charges of tax evasion, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  fraud and campaign finance violations related to the payments to Daniels and McDougal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=177.82000000000002s)]
*  And he later tells a federal court in Manhattan that Trump directed him to make the payments. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=184.58s)]
*  Jumping to August 2019, the Office of Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance subpoenas the Trump [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=189.82s)]
*  Organization for records related to the payments. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=194.38s)]
*  And a year later, in July 2020, the Supreme Court sides with Vance in a 7-2 ruling finding [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=198.42s)]
*  that Trump is not immune from the DA's subpoena. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  But it will take until February 25th of 2021 before Vance's office obtains Trump's tax [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=208.48s)]
*  returns. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=214.7s)]
*  On November 2nd of that year, Alvin Bragg is elected as the next Manhattan DA. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=215.94s)]
*  And that brings us to this year, 2023. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=220.58s)]
*  In January, Michael Cohen meets with investigators from the DA's office, a sign that Bragg's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  investigation is picking up steam. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=229.06s)]
*  At the end of the month, the New York Times reports that Bragg has convened a grand jury [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  to examine the evidence in the hush money probe. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=235.86s)]
*  And that gets us to this month, March. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  On March 9th, the DA's office invites Trump to testify before the grand jury. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=242.26s)]
*  Four days later, on March 13th, Trump's lawyer says he will not be testifying before the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  grand jury. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  That same day, Michael Cohen testifies before the grand jury for the first time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=252.89999999999998s)]
*  March 15th, he testifies again. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=257.06s)]
*  Stormy Daniels meets with investigators from the DA's office. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=259.9s)]
*  We don't know where this timeline will go next. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=263.46s)]
*  But I have to bet Donald Trump never thought in 2006, 17 years ago, that when he was allegedly [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=266.86s)]
*  having an affair with Stormy Daniels, the actions he would later take to keep that quiet [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=272.9s)]
*  might get him indicted. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUD0mrYytIA&t=278.98s)]
