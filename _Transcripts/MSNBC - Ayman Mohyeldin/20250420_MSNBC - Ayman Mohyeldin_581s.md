Video Description: Mohsen Mahdawi, who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and is a U.S. permanent resident, was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security during his naturalization interview in Vermont on Monday. He is a Columbia University student and prominent peace activist who has publicly advocated for peace and unity with Jewish students. Yet the Trump administration continues to abduct and then smear these students as supporters of terrorism and as anti-Semitic. MSNBC senior contributing editor Michele Norris spoke to Vermont Congresswoman Becca Balint about the Trump administration crackdown and the fear it is causing.

# Rep. Becca Balint unloads on Trump administration for false claims against detained students
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4)
*  Well, Donald Trump and his administration are full speed ahead on deportations, both [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=0.0s)]
*  lawful and unlawful. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=4.5s)]
*  The court system continues to try to rein him in. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=6.04s)]
*  Early this morning, the Supreme Court ordered that the administration cannot deport Venezuelans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=9.28s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act for now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=14.24s)]
*  The administration is trying to deport men who they claim are members of a gang. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=17.32s)]
*  But there are serious questions about whether they can use this wartime law when the U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=21.16s)]
*  is not technically at war. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=25.64s)]
*  There are also questions about whether these individuals are even gang members. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=28.22s)]
*  The Trump administration was also delivered a setback in its case against Tufts University [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=32.82s)]
*  Ph.D. student Ramesa Ozturk, who was snatched off the street by government agents in March [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=37.14s)]
*  for co-authoring an op-ed in a student paper about Israel and the Palestinians. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=42.46s)]
*  She was taken from Massachusetts all the way to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=48.3s)]
*  But a federal judge ruled on Friday that she must be transferred back to Vermont because [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=53.3s)]
*  Vermont was the last place she was held in custody before being shipped to Louisiana, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  where the Trump administration feels they have judges that are favorable to their agenda. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=63.22s)]
*  However, the abduction of students in America continues, becoming a defining image of America's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  democratic backsliding. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=75.94s)]
*  This was the scene Monday in Vermont. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=78.1s)]
*  Mohsen Madhawi, a prominent peace activist at Columbia University and like Mahmoud Khalil [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=80.5s)]
*  of Palestinian descent and a green card holder, was arrested after showing up for a citizenship [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  interview. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  So, this is someone in the country legally and going through the immigration process [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  the correct and the legal way, and today he sits in an ICE detention facility because [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=97.3s)]
*  of his political views. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  Unlike Mahmoud Khalil, Madhawi knew this was coming. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=105.7s)]
*  A day before his arrest, he gave an interview to CBS News where he said his, quote, freedom [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  was in jeopardy and that he worried that his citizenship interview was, quote, a honey [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=114.38s)]
*  trap. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=119.62s)]
*  He turned out to be right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=120.78s)]
*  But he does have many people advocating for his freedom, including in Vermont and the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=122.94s)]
*  congressional delegation there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=128.34s)]
*  Joining me now is Vermont Congresswoman Becca Ballant. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=130.7s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us, Congresswoman. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=134.06s)]
*  It seems like all roads, or at least a lot of roads, are leading to Vermont right now [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=136.1s)]
*  with these abductions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=141.42s)]
*  With Mohsen Madhawi being detained, there now a judge ruling that Ms. Osterk needs to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=142.98s)]
*  be transferred back to Vermont. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=148.06s)]
*  What do you think is actually happening here? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  Do you have faith in the courts that they're going to continue to rein in the administration [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=153.38s)]
*  in their attempts to deport these students? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=158.1s)]
*  Well, certainly that is what we are all hoping for. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=160.86s)]
*  It's what we're counting on that our judicial system will hold. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=164.46s)]
*  As you said, when you look at the case of Mohsen Madhawi, he was a peace activist. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=168.58s)]
*  When the government argues that somehow he was a threat to our foreign interests, what [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=175.22s)]
*  are you even talking about? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=182.3s)]
*  He was in communication with Israelis when he was at Columbia seeking peace, seeking [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=184.22s)]
*  to bridge the divide between Palestinians and Israelis. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=189.8s)]
*  He said that the fight for the freedom of Palestine and the fight against anti-Semitism [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=193.8s)]
*  are one and the same because this boasts injustice. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=198.56s)]
*  So if this man who preaches peace, this man who is a green card holder, has been here [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=201.6s)]
*  for 10 years, who was doing everything right in order to seek citizenship, if he is somehow [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=209.56s)]
*  our enemy, then we have gone down a very dark road indeed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  And as you talked about earlier, there are so many of these instances. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  And one of the things that I want to do, which is why I continue to talk about this case, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=227.16000000000003s)]
*  is it's not just about Madhawi. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=232.08s)]
*  It's not just about the case of Garcia, who is being held in El Salvador. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=235.0s)]
*  It is about the fact that this government, the Trump administration, is not following [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=242.96s)]
*  our constitutional rights, is not following federal law. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  This should terrify all of us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=253.32s)]
*  And in fact, we have seen even citizens being detained. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  We saw that just a few days ago. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=259.24s)]
*  And we have citizens of the United States getting these letters from our government [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=261.68s)]
*  telling them to self-deport citizens. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=267.44s)]
*  And he had a meeting, he being Trump, had a meeting in the Oval Office the other day [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=270.72s)]
*  with the president of El Salvador, laying out for all of us, citizens are next. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  We're building more prisons. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  We're building more detention centers. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  So this is not a man who believes in the rule of law. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  And we know Trump does not believe in birthright citizenship. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  He is going to come after naturalized citizens next. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=292.8s)]
*  No question. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=296.24s)]
*  As he called the home-growns. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=297.64s)]
*  The home-growns, whatever that means. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=300.76s)]
*  And it means something different on every day. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=303.08s)]
*  And I was so taken by your last two guests and how they were talking about, this is all [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=305.48s)]
*  about getting us to hate each other. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=311.56s)]
*  It is all about division and soaking fear and resentment so that he can amass more power [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=314.32s)]
*  and that people who are here legally seeking a better life for themselves, OK, are cut [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  out of the American dream. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=331.0s)]
*  And I'm just so disgusted by what is happening right now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=333.36s)]
*  And I want good people of any political stripe, good people to stand up and say, this is not [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=337.12s)]
*  what this country was founded on. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=344.36s)]
*  It's not who we say we are. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=347.0s)]
*  We can't just meld ideals. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=348.6s)]
*  We have to live up to them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=350.56s)]
*  I want to talk about the people in your district. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  When you look at what's happening in this country, do you have constituents who are [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=356.8s)]
*  asking you if it's safe to protest in this country? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=360.88s)]
*  Constituents who might be U.S. citizens and nonetheless wonder if it's safe to participate [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  in the democratic process in this country. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  And if they do ask you these kinds of questions, what do you tell them? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=371.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so glad you asked this because that's where we're at. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  I had a constituent ask me the other day. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=379.16s)]
*  She was a woman of color and she's a naturalized citizen. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=382.52s)]
*  And she said, is it safe for me to protest? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=386.08s)]
*  And it broke my heart to have to say to her, I don't think it is safe for you to protest, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=389.12s)]
*  which is why we need other people to stand in your stead, to stand up for you and others [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  who are more at risk in this situation. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=400.52s)]
*  My wife is an attorney. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=403.56s)]
*  We live in Vermont. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=404.84s)]
*  We travel back and forth to Canada. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=405.64s)]
*  We have so much love and respect for Canadians and for Quebec, the Quebec province. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=407.4s)]
*  And she told me yesterday while we were having our coffee in the morning, she said, I am [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  not going to travel back and forth with my own phone anymore. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to have a burner phone because she's an attorney. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=422.23999999999995s)]
*  She's not an immigration attorney. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=425.08s)]
*  But she said it isn't safe for us anymore to travel because what we're seeing is ICE [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=426.88s)]
*  is demanding to look into the phones again of citizens, of citizens. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=431.96s)]
*  This is chilling, absolutely chilling. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=439.92s)]
*  And let's say you have a Vermonter who comes up to me and says, well, look, I do want a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=442.96s)]
*  secure border. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=449.96s)]
*  I do want to make sure that our country is secure. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=450.96s)]
*  This government is not making us more secure by these actions, by deporting someone in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  the case of Garcia, who has been, he's been told that it was a clerical error. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=462.16s)]
*  He's being deported on a clerical error and our president is saying, we are not going [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  to return him no matter what. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=475.6s)]
*  This is a very sickening moment that we're in right now. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=477.16s)]
*  And it's going to take all of us. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  It's going to take elected officials. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=482.52000000000004s)]
*  It's going to take members of the press like yourself. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=484.52s)]
*  But it's going to take all of us to have to stand up and say, we will not allow this to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  happen in this country. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=493.35999999999996s)]
*  And I'm just, I'm despairing at this moment. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  But I have faith in the good people across this country who will stand with Vermonters [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=499.12s)]
*  in saying no, no. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=504.0s)]
*  So I've got to let you go, but I just want to ask you one last quick question. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSASNlEBSo4&t=506.52s)]
