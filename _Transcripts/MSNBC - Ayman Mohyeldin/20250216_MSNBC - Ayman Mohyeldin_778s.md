Video Description: Donald Trump, with the help of Elon Musk, is working to dismantle key parts of the U.S. government. So, how is House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries responding?

# 'No leverage'? Democratic voters push leaders to aggressively fight Trump
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c)
*  We begin this hour with a nation in crisis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump and an unelected reactionary billionaire [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  are working overtime to dismantle key parts of our government [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=6.08s)]
*  and they're waging war against progress [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=9.84s)]
*  and any shred of accountability for themselves or their allies. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=11.92s)]
*  So what is one of the key leaders of the opposition party [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=15.36s)]
*  saying during these unprecedented times? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=18.36s)]
*  Now that's a good question. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=20.44s)]
*  How is he planning to lead or to inspire the resistance [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=21.44s)]
*  against what is starting to look like authoritarianism? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=25.36s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out what leverage we actually have. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=30.08s)]
*  What leverage do we have? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=33.88s)]
*  Republicans have repeatedly lectured America. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=37.84s)]
*  They control the House, the Senate and the presidency. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=40.0s)]
*  It's their government. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=43.28s)]
*  What leverage do we have? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=46.64s)]
*  What a message from House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  The idea that Democrats would concede defeat less than a month [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=53.36s)]
*  into Trump's presidency is not just disheartening. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=56.96s)]
*  It's also alarming. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=59.56s)]
*  Republicans currently have just a three-vote edge [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=60.84s)]
*  over Democrats in the House. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=63.56s)]
*  That's one of the smallest majorities in US history. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=65.08s)]
*  Let's go back to 2010, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=67.76s)]
*  when Republicans were the ones in the minority. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Remember, they weaponized backlash against the Affordable Care Act [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=71.68s)]
*  and embraced the Tea Party movement, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  ultimately leading the party to pick up 63 seats [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=77.2s)]
*  in the House in the midterms. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=80.28s)]
*  It was so bad that then President Obama famously said [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=81.64s)]
*  Democrats took a shellacking. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=84.92s)]
*  Four years later, Senate Republicans successfully campaigned [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  against Obama, allowing the GOP to take full control of Congress. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  And let's not forget what the Democratic Party accomplished in 2018 [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  after Trump's first presidential victory. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  House Democrats campaigned on the backlash to Trump's first term [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=100.72s)]
*  and his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=104.44s)]
*  They won back the House with the highest voter turnout [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=108.2s)]
*  we'd seen in the midterm election since 1914. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, Jeffrey's comments that Democrats have no leverage [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=114.56s)]
*  aren't just absurd, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  they also show Democrats are still out of touch with what voters want. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=119.44s)]
*  Because according to a new CBS News YouGov poll, 65%... [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=123.96s)]
*  65% of Democratic voters want the party to oppose Trump as much as possible. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=128.76s)]
*  That's compared to 35% who want to work with him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  The second figure is down from last month, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=139.84s)]
*  when 54% of Democratic voters said they wanted the party [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=141.8s)]
*  to find common ground with Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  And yet, Axios reports House Democrats are, quote, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=147.28s)]
*  pissed at liberal grassroots organizations like MoveOn and Indivisible [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=150.96s)]
*  that are trying to stir up more confrontational opposition to Trump. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=155.36s)]
*  One Democrat said the House minority leader is very frustrated at the groups, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  reporting that Jeffries himself has dismissed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  Isn't the Democratic Party supposed to be right now in the midst of a reckoning, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=168.0s)]
*  trying to figure out what happened after the election results, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=173.16s)]
*  trying to listen to what voters actually want? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=176.36s)]
*  And aren't Democrats the ones who campaigned on this idea [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  of defeating Trump in the name of saving democracy? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=183.24s)]
*  That was the message. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=186.4s)]
*  If they want to have any shot at getting back into power, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=188.24s)]
*  they need to listen to their base, to the field. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=191.36s)]
*  They're asking for a fight, not a surrender. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=195.44s)]
*  Let's bring in my panel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=198.56s)]
*  Joining me now is Greisa Martinez-Rosas, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=199.96s)]
*  Executive Director for the nonprofit group United We Dream, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=202.08s)]
*  Hayes Brown, writer and editor for MSNBC Daily, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=205.44s)]
*  and Chuck Rocha, founder of Solidarity Strategies and a Democratic Strategist. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=208.84s)]
*  Greisa, I'm going to start with you, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=213.72s)]
*  because you wrote this week an op-ed for the New York Times. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  The op-ed is titled, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=219.56s)]
*  Why Democrats Fail the Immigration Test Every Time. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  You write about how Democrats need to fight back [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=225.56s)]
*  against the right's anti-immigration push, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=228.2s)]
*  saying, and I'm quoting you, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=230.6s)]
*  Democrats don't need to overcomplicate this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=232.28s)]
*  They just need to throw a punch. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=234.76s)]
*  So, Greisa, what is your reaction when you see Jeffries [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=238.12s)]
*  making statements like this? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  Or, for example, when you see some Democrats [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  that voted with Republicans in favor of the Lake and Riley Act, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=247.84s)]
*  which, of course, targets immigrants. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=251.84s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=253.92s)]
*  No, Bella, everyday people have a reason to be concerned. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=257.68s)]
*  Every day it feels like something is on fire, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=261.28s)]
*  that our families are less safe, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=263.8s)]
*  while the richest man in the world [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=266.12s)]
*  holds a press conference in the Oval Office [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=268.08s)]
*  enacting a plan that is robbing us of our future and our money. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=270.48s)]
*  So the American people were demanding leadership [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  of each other, of our elected officials, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=277.52s)]
*  of our media, and Democrats have an opportunity in this moment [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=280.76s)]
*  to expose the con and flip the frame. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=285.76s)]
*  This isn't about a border crisis. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=288.96s)]
*  This is a labor crisis, a real villain, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=292.52s)]
*  and the real villains are not immigrants. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  They're politicians in the corporations [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  who profit from our instability. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=300.32s)]
*  So when Move On members and the Visible members, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=302.2s)]
*  United We Dream members, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  we're making calls to our members of Congress. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=305.68s)]
*  We're asking for partners. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=308.44s)]
*  In the last couple of weeks, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=310.16s)]
*  thousands of young high school kids and college kids [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=311.68s)]
*  have gone to the streets demanding a different America. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  Thousands of millions of Americans [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=317.48s)]
*  have been calling their members of Congress [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=319.48s)]
*  to take action in this moment, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=321.12s)]
*  and so people have a right to be angry and scared, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=322.48s)]
*  and we also have a right to ask for more [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=325.48s)]
*  from our elected officials. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=327.36s)]
*  Hez, as Greisa mentions, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  if some of these groups like Indivisible and Move On [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=331.72s)]
*  actually just want partners, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=335.0s)]
*  and that's what she said, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  what is your take on this sort of complaining allegedly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=337.16s)]
*  that some congressional Democrats are feeling right now? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=341.24s)]
*  I mean, I think that they need to realize [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  that the people who are calling their offices [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  are on their side. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=348.68s)]
*  They're saying, we are also Democrats. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=349.92s)]
*  We want you to do more. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=352.44s)]
*  I get the sort of defensiveness of being like, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=353.92s)]
*  hey, we're doing the best we can. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=356.88s)]
*  The institutions are what they are. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=358.88s)]
*  We don't have a majority, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=360.44s)]
*  so we are sort of locked out of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=361.68s)]
*  pushing the gears of power forward. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=364.36s)]
*  But I think that Democrats are not used [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=367.04s)]
*  to being a true opposition party. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=370.04s)]
*  They're not used to being the ones [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=372.44s)]
*  who stand to strive progress and say no. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=374.08s)]
*  They're not used to being the ones who say, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=376.44s)]
*  actually, no, we're not going to try to negotiate with you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=378.64s)]
*  because there is no common ground to be found with you, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=381.8s)]
*  and I get why the instinct is to go back to that well, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=384.6s)]
*  to say, okay, we gotta pull off someone. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=388.76s)]
*  A three-vote majority, the Republicans cannot stand [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=392.0s)]
*  to lose very many people on any given vote in the House. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=394.76s)]
*  Jeffries, I think, needs to exploit that more. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  He needs to lean into the fact that, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=401.0s)]
*  hey, if you guys lose three votes, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  whether that's moderates or because we are poking [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  conservatives to tell them to like, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=407.32s)]
*  hey, go further on this one really weird thing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=408.84s)]
*  that you guys are obsessed with to tank the whole bill, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=411.64s)]
*  lean on that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=414.23999999999995s)]
*  If you are saying that, if you believe that Democrats [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  out in the field, the base wants a fight, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=419.32s)]
*  give them that fight, give them that red meat [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=423.0s)]
*  to keep them encouraged enough to get to the midterms [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  because I think that's what a lot of congressional [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=428.28s)]
*  Democrats are waiting for is, oh, midterms are gonna come [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=429.64s)]
*  and we'll be fine then, not if you yield ground now [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=432.52s)]
*  that you'll have to make up later. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  I think, Chuck, one of the things that everyone [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=437.84s)]
*  can agree on, and I know you've talked extensively [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  about this, is the fact that many Democrats [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=442.64s)]
*  have acknowledged that they have and had, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=445.4s)]
*  during the election, a messaging problem. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=447.88s)]
*  But I want you to take a listen at how Jeff Rees [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=450.12s)]
*  addressed the issue during a recent podcast interview [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=452.96s)]
*  with John Stewart, take a listen. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=455.52s)]
*  I think there's a few things going on here. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=459.24s)]
*  In terms of how we better communicate [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=461.44s)]
*  with the American people, Maya Angelou said it best, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=464.2s)]
*  people won't remember what you say, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=466.28s)]
*  they may not even remember what you do, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=469.2s)]
*  but they will always remember how you make them feel. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=472.12s)]
*  And I think what we have to do a better job of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=475.04s)]
*  is making the American people feel that we understand [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  the pain that they've been in economically. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=481.92s)]
*  Chuck, your response to that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think it's good to root this in some facts [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  where folks around Washington, D.C. are walking around [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=492.20000000000005s)]
*  like they think Donald Trump won 70 or 80% of the election. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  There was a problem with our messaging, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=498.76s)]
*  but we first gotta root this in making sure [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=500.72s)]
*  everybody understands that Donald Trump did not get [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=502.8s)]
*  70 or 80% of the electorate. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=505.04s)]
*  He got less than a majority of all the votes cast. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=506.92s)]
*  He got 49.9%. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=509.92s)]
*  That means a majority of Americans voted for somebody else. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=511.72s)]
*  48.7% of those voted for the Vice President Harris. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=514.92s)]
*  And guess the reason why we lost? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=519.76s)]
*  The reason why we lost is over 10 million, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=521.5600000000001s)]
*  up to 19 million Democrats stayed home. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=524.2s)]
*  Paola, to your point about the messaging, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=527.36s)]
*  it wasn't because folks were running to Donald Trump, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=529.52s)]
*  yes, about one and a half million more Republicans [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=531.76s)]
*  voted than four years ago, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=534.8s)]
*  while almost 19 million less Democrats did. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=536.12s)]
*  That means you had a problem motivating your base [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=538.64s)]
*  to show up to vote for you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=541.28s)]
*  Give them something to vote for, which is your message, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=542.3599999999999s)]
*  but also, in your earlier part, talking about the fight, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=544.88s)]
*  showing them what they're fighting against. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=548.4s)]
*  To win an election, you have to show [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=550.4799999999999s)]
*  who is fighting to hurt you, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=552.4799999999999s)]
*  and then what your plan is to make their lives better. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=554.68s)]
*  Democrats can fight with every fiber of their being [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=558.28s)]
*  while laying out a vision that's centered around work [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=562.2s)]
*  and the honor of work and families [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=564.48s)]
*  to make a pathway forward. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  I've been doing this my whole life. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=568.0s)]
*  We've been doing this with lots of my friends [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=569.6s)]
*  who are on this panel, and there's a way to do this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=571.1600000000001s)]
*  We just have to get out of each other's way, Democrat. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=573.48s)]
*  Okay, so we talked about Jeffries, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=577.44s)]
*  and Bagre said compare what Jeffries has said [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=580.0400000000001s)]
*  to what Congresswoman Alexiño Ocasio-Cortez has said. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=583.6s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=586.24s)]
*  We should be very clear with the American people [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=588.44s)]
*  that the House is governed by a Republican majority, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=592.16s)]
*  the Senate is governed by a Republican majority, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=595.0s)]
*  and the White House has a Republican president. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=597.08s)]
*  And if they want to pass their agenda, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=599.44s)]
*  Republicans need to conjure up the votes [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=602.88s)]
*  for them to pass their own bills. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  So, Greisa, essentially here, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=608.6800000000001s)]
*  AOC is seeing the complete opposite, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=610.48s)]
*  essentially arguing, actually, hold up. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=612.64s)]
*  Democrats have plenty of leverage. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=614.96s)]
*  Yeah, they have more power than any one of us on this panel. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=619.2800000000001s)]
*  We elected them exactly for that job. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=622.48s)]
*  And so the real victory of this moment [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=625.0s)]
*  isn't just about surviving another fight [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=627.0s)]
*  or surviving another floor vote or floor speeches. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=629.36s)]
*  It's about changing the conditions [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=632.0400000000001s)]
*  so that we never have to fight like this again. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=633.88s)]
*  And that requires a fight, it requires a vision, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=635.72s)]
*  and it requires to follow the energy [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=638.6s)]
*  that we're seeing all across the country. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=640.6s)]
*  People are ready to call for a vote, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=642.12s)]
*  they're ready to call the BS out, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=644.28s)]
*  they're ready to be able to put people into account. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=646.96s)]
*  And I think we should follow their energy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=650.24s)]
*  Hey, let's talk about New York City, right? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=654.08s)]
*  Because New York offers suddenly this vital test [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=656.08s)]
*  where you have a mayor that is openly siding with Trump, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=660.2s)]
*  that is openly defying New York City sanctuary laws, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=664.76s)]
*  after, of course, the DOJ is ordering prosecutors [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  to drop his criminal case in a scenario [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  like the one that we're in right now. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=675.24s)]
*  How should Democrats respond, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=676.4399999999999s)]
*  given that the governor has the authority [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=678.48s)]
*  to fire Mayor Eric Adams? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=681.04s)]
*  And so I guess when you take a step back, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=682.28s)]
*  what is the right response if you're a Democrat right now? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  I think the right response if you're a Democrat [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=687.4s)]
*  is honestly the most cutthroat political one you can do. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=689.24s)]
*  You look at Eric Adams' poll numbers in New York City, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  you look at the fact that he's talking to Republicans, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=694.68s)]
*  according to New York Times, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=697.16s)]
*  about the idea of potentially running [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=698.12s)]
*  either as a Republican or as both a Republican [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=699.84s)]
*  and Democrat in the fall. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=703.08s)]
*  He's looking for a way to get around the fact [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=704.88s)]
*  that Democrats in New York City might not vote for him [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=708.6s)]
*  in the upcoming primary. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=711.44s)]
*  I think you cut him loose. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=713.2s)]
*  I think that there is little to gain [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=714.4s)]
*  from keeping Eric Adams on board right now [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=716.76s)]
*  when you have people who came out to support him [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=719.12s)]
*  in terms of fighting crime [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=723.36s)]
*  or because people are upset [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=724.96s)]
*  about how immigration has been run in New York City. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=726.9200000000001s)]
*  But I feel like a lot of those people will also look [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=729.52s)]
*  at how he is capitulating to the Donald Trump regime [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=731.64s)]
*  and getting out of his own legal troubles [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=736.08s)]
*  by throwing other people under the bus. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=738.64s)]
*  That's not something a leader does. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=740.36s)]
*  And I don't know what Hokel stands to gain from backing him. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=742.0s)]
*  There's no love lost usually between the governor [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6JMur2S2c&t=745.84s)]
