# House Oversight Committee Expands Inquiry Into Trump’s Handling Of Records
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M)
*  Tonight, there are new revelations about the presidential records that Trump improperly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=0.0s)]
*  took with him to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Some records are apparently so sensitive that there may be limits to how those documents [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=6.04s)]
*  can be described to the general public. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=11.34s)]
*  The Washington Post is reporting that some of the documents taken by the National Archives [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=13.58s)]
*  are under the very highest levels of classification and can only be viewed by a small number of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=19.2s)]
*  government officials. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  That news comes as the chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee suggests she's broadening [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=27.1s)]
*  her panel's investigation into the breadth of potential records and the potential violations [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  of the Records Act under Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=38.28s)]
*  I am now joined by the chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee, Congresswoman Carolyn [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=40.78s)]
*  Maloney. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us this evening. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Let me start out by asking you, what additional information are you requesting from the National [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=48.02s)]
*  Archives at this moment? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=52.72s)]
*  Well, Eamonn, we are seeking detailed accounting of all of the materials that were included [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=55.7s)]
*  in those 15 boxes that were delivered to his summer home, including all classified documents [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=62.02s)]
*  that were recovered. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=69.26s)]
*  All classified documents have already been sent to the Department of Justice for their [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=70.62s)]
*  review and follow-up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  We're also seeking the documents that the archives obtained that were ripped up. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=77.42s)]
*  I'm very interested in seeing what did they rip up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=82.9s)]
*  They pasted some of them together, but they literally shipped over torn up documents that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=87.58000000000001s)]
*  the archives are putting together. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  So we've requested to be able to view all of these torn up documents. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=95.78s)]
*  And I'm interested, very interested in the Trump administration's internal communication [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=101.9s)]
*  on how they communicated about these documents, about their efforts to preserve them or destroy [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=114.05999999999999s)]
*  So we are expanding our investigation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=115.05999999999999s)]
*  You write, Congresswoman, in the letter to the National Archives that you are deeply [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=118.3s)]
*  concerned that Donald Trump broke the law. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=122.46s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=126.34s)]
*  Why do you believe that? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=127.34s)]
*  Because the law says that these documents belong to the American people. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=130.5s)]
*  They don't belong to him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=135.14s)]
*  And the law says that he should turn them over to the archives to be preserved for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=137.10000000000002s)]
*  his history. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=141.9s)]
*  And yet he decided to keep 15 boxes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  I want to know what was in those boxes and to review what exactly happened. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=147.94000000000003s)]
*  Now, the reason I'm committed to uncovering the full depth of the actions, because I want [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  to see the full depth of the Presidential Records Act violations that may have occurred [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  by former President Trump and his administration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  And we need to use these findings to advance critical reforms to prevent future abuses. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=170.66s)]
*  We need to really have a better control over the documents for the purpose of history. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=177.82s)]
*  And certainly, public documents should not be destroyed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  Can I just ask you to expand on something you said a moment ago? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=188.3s)]
*  You also requested, as you were just saying, documents and communications relating to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=190.98s)]
*  White House employees or contractors finding papers and a toilet in the White House. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=195.26s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=201.74s)]
*  It's been reported in the press and it's been reported in other ways, and it's been reported [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=205.3s)]
*  by whistleblowers that documents were torn up and put in the toilet and flushed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=210.66s)]
*  They brought in contractors to remove these documents. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=216.46s)]
*  I want to understand who these contractors were. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=220.7s)]
*  What did they find? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  What were those documents? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  It's astonishing when you think about it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  Oh, it's absolutely astonishing and troubling. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=228.06s)]
*  Almost unbelievable. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=232.26s)]
*  It's almost unbelievable that the President of the United States allegedly tore up documents [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=233.32s)]
*  and flushed them down the commode. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=238.64s)]
*  It's probably no surprise that he has denied wrongdoing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  He's repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying that some of the items he took from the White [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=244.54s)]
*  House were gifts and mementos. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=247.98s)]
*  Hard for you to believe that? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  Your response? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=252.82s)]
*  I would say that classified documents, highly classified documents, are not mementos. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=255.18s)]
*  They are critical information for our country that needs to be preserved and protected [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=261.9s)]
*  and studied by the appropriate people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=266.3s)]
*  Let me ask you finally. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=269.02s)]
*  You had the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, confirmed earlier this week that the, in fact, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=270.02s)]
*  the Department of Justice is looking into this matter. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=273.98s)]
*  Are you prepared to issue a criminal referral? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=277.62s)]
*  Do you think the Department of Justice is moving at a fast enough speed in this investigation? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=280.1s)]
*  That's not my job. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=287.42s)]
*  My job is to uncover the information, to look at ways to reform the system and make it stronger [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=288.42s)]
*  and more accountable and transparent to the American people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=294.1s)]
*  That is his job. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=297.62s)]
*  I trust him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=298.62s)]
*  He has an excellent record. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=299.62s)]
*  He publicly said that he will uphold the law and that no president is above the law. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=301.12s)]
*  No one is above the law. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=305.9s)]
*  That he will uphold the law. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=306.9s)]
*  He will study every document and proceed accordingly. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=308.82s)]
*  That's his job. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  All right, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, we will check in back with you as this continues [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  to develop. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time this evening. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtobaq70c_M&t=318.65999999999997s)]
