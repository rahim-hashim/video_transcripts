# The Media's Role In The January 6th Hearings
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo)
*  All right. So the curtain has fallen on the January 6 committee's first round of hearings. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=0.0s)]
*  And now the big question is, now what? So the committee has made clear they're going [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=7.48s)]
*  to resume hearings in September. We know that as much. But what happens between now and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=12.34s)]
*  till then? Now, in a sense, it really is our turn. And I speak here as a member of the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=16.8s)]
*  media. We in the news media and you at home have a responsibility to take everything that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=22.52s)]
*  has been presented and work to understand what exactly it means, not just in this like [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=27.74s)]
*  quick knee jerk manner that happens so often in the minutes after one of the hearings wraps, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=33.22s)]
*  but also in a deeper sense, when all the pieces of the puzzle can come together. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=38.42s)]
*  Let's listen to Liz Cheney this week in her closing statement about this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=45.9s)]
*  Every American must consider this. Can a president who is willing to make the choices Donald [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=50.78s)]
*  Trump made during the violence of January 6th ever be trusted with any position of authority [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=57.620000000000005s)]
*  in our great nation again? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=65.22s)]
*  There's probably nothing that I agree with Liz Cheney on. But how do we take what she [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=69.1s)]
*  just said there? How do we build off of that sentiment from Congresswoman Cheney? And it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=73.08s)]
*  starts with the facts and a warning. Mother Jones, D.C. bureau chief David Corn, who's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=78.18s)]
*  going to join me in just a minute, reminds us that Trump and his allies have actually [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  escaped accountability before when they were in a similar position during the Russia investigation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=87.30000000000001s)]
*  And you may remember that David Corn wrote at the time Trump and his comrades have been [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  rather deft at developing a tactic to protect him from charges of profound wrongdoing. They [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=97.78s)]
*  raised the bar. There was plenty of confirmed evidence that Trump and his crew acted in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=103.7s)]
*  a sleazy and improper manner. Yet Trump and his protectors defined the scandal in different [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=108.14s)]
*  terms. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=114.9s)]
*  Did he collude with the Kremlin? When special counsel Robert Mueller reported he had not [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=115.9s)]
*  found evidence that Trump criminally conspired with the Russians, Trump and his call declared [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=120.14s)]
*  he had been cleared. Even though Mueller's final report documented his misdeeds and detailed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=124.62s)]
*  numerous instances in which Trump possibly obstructed justice. No collusion equals no [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  culpability. That is how Trump managed to reshape the Russia scandal. So how do we make [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=138.7s)]
*  sure that Trump and his cronies do not escape accountability this time? This is the great [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=144.54s)]
*  challenge we in the news media and you at home face. We cannot let Trump's allies or [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=151.22s)]
*  our own imaginations dictate the terms of the January 6th committee's findings. The [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=157.18s)]
*  facts and only the facts, only the facts, excuse me, must tell that story. Because the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=162.22s)]
*  moment we step away from the facts, we are letting the other side dictate the rules of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=169.94s)]
*  the game. And guess what? The facts are pretty freaking damning. So as we wait for the committee [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=174.3s)]
*  to hold more hearings, all of us, myself included, must make sure the committee's findings and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=179.34s)]
*  only their findings tell that damning story. It's not about coming up with the biggest [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  or the worst Trump conspiracy imaginable. It's about telling the real story of what [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  happened before, after and on January the 6th. We have to let the facts do the work [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=195.9s)]
*  and call out the lies and obfuscation on the other side. And then, and then maybe, just [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  maybe the people who need to be held accountable will actually and finally be held accountable [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=208.5s)]
*  for what they have done to our country. Joining me now is David Korn, mother Jones, DC beer [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=215.02s)]
*  chief and an MSNBC political contributor and the author of the forthcoming book, American [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=219.58s)]
*  Psychosis, a historical investigation of how the Republican Party went bonkers. David, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=223.98s)]
*  it's great to see you again. Thanks for coming back on the show. Talk about your piece and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=229.46s)]
*  your fears that a similar framing could befall the January 6th committee, because if we know [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=232.98s)]
*  one thing, the Republicans are good at reframing the facts to try and make it say it's not [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=238.06s)]
*  what you think it is. It's something completely different. Yes. And I will say that I wrote [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=243.7s)]
*  that piece before the last hearing, which I think changes things a little bit. But the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=248.62s)]
*  big question here is there's so much on the public record we know already. And yet we [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=253.46s)]
*  often get diverted, deflected into other questions like will Trump be prosecuted? Well, did he [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=259.48s)]
*  break the law? What's going to happen with investigations out of the Justice Department? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=265.38s)]
*  And you have on the other side, Trump's own side, saying things like it was a wonderful rally. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=268.97999999999996s)]
*  That's what we're focused on. And we're not going to talk about what happened afterwards. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=274.73999999999995s)]
*  Trump wasn't involved in what happened. He ended up not going to the riot on Capitol Hill. So [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  what they try to do is create a definitional debate where he is innocent because you're closely [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=285.7s)]
*  sort of defining the terms and you're narrowing the perspective. Now, what the committee did, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=293.42s)]
*  I think directly to try to address this, is focus this last hearing on Thursday night on one key [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=299.42s)]
*  element. I mean, there are lots of different parts of the January 6 story. I think up before [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=307.70000000000005s)]
*  the committee hearings, it was hard for a lot of Americans to absorb the full picture and to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=312.94s)]
*  understand everything in spades. But what they did on Thursday night was to focus on one key [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  fact, 187 minutes between the end of his speech and when he said something about ending the riot. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=323.02s)]
*  What did Trump do in that time period? The answer is nothing. And they showed a very strong case [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=328.7s)]
*  that he did nothing on purpose. There wasn't a mistake. It wasn't an accident. He wanted this [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  violence to continue because it was serving his ends, his purpose of delaying and maybe even [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=342.09999999999997s)]
*  putting off entirely the certification of electoral counter that was going on in the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=347.9s)]
*  Senate and the House. So if you took away everything else, the call to Georgia to try to get him extra [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=353.5s)]
*  votes, the fake electors, the conspiracy theories, pressuring the Justice Department, pressuring Mike [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=361.46s)]
*  Pence, if you took away everything else and just thought about that moment when this guy, it's his [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=367.62s)]
*  job to defend the Constitution and the U.S. government did not do his job, you will see that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=374.06s)]
*  no other president has ever engaged in such reckless dereliction of duty. And the committee [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=379.9s)]
*  really focused on that, I think, to sort of find a through line here, that it doesn't matter whether [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=385.74s)]
*  this was a crime or whether he's prosecuted or not. And so I think they did a good job of directing [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=392.46s)]
*  our attention and focusing our attention. Of course, you know the news media and the news [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=399.5s)]
*  ecosystem as well as anyone, Eamon. We get very distracted and it's very hard to keep focused on [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=404.54s)]
*  anything for a long period of time. So what will be done with this information is really entirely [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=409.34s)]
*  an open question. All right. So let me pick up on that point as a member of the press and give it to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=416.46s)]
*  us straight. Do you think that the news media in its totality is up for the challenge of pushing [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=421.26s)]
*  back against the GOP narratives, not just in terms of how they spin the facts or the events [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=426.06s)]
*  of that day, but when you have people like Mike Pence or Condoleezza Rice saying the Democrats [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=431.42s)]
*  just want to focus on one day in January, it's time to move on, it's time to look forward and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=436.14s)]
*  trying to kind of frame this as like something years ago and we should stop obsessing over it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=439.98s)]
*  I think that's the good, that's the strong point here. Now we have this record, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=446.78s)]
*  now that there's been more to the record added by the Thursday hearing, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=450.46s)]
*  and I assume there'll be more to come, it's up to the media to decide how important this is and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=454.62s)]
*  how much attention to pay to it and what to do when one side wants to try to spin its way out of it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=460.14s)]
*  I mean, they're very good. We see our NBC and MSNBC colleagues chasing after members of the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=466.22s)]
*  House and Senate, Republican members, and trying to get them to comment on this. And they go, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=472.22s)]
*  I'm not talking about this. I don't care about this. This is the past. This is what Mike Pence [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=477.1s)]
*  said the other day. I'm not focused on the past. Well, excuse me. Every criminal trial in America [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=481.18s)]
*  is about the past. And if you're running for office, Mike Pence for president, say, or Donald [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=487.90000000000003s)]
*  Trump again, and you're not going to talk about this most tragic and horrific day in American [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=493.34000000000003s)]
*  history that you were a part of, well then why should anyone take you seriously? And I think [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=498.06s)]
*  it is hard, it's hard for us and the press to keep asking the same question again and again and again, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=502.22s)]
*  particularly when people like Mitch McConnell just say, I'm not going to answer the question. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=508.3s)]
*  You kind of feel in some ways perhaps that you look a little obsessive, a little silly, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=511.82s)]
*  or maybe even unfair, which is what they want you to look like, which is what they want you to feel. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=516.62s)]
*  And so I mean, I think everybody, every Republican should be asked what they think about [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=523.58s)]
*  Liz Cheney and her statement that you just played earlier and what they think would happen Thursday [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=529.1s)]
*  night. They are just trying to duck and cover. At the very beginning of the hearings, we had [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=534.78s)]
*  saying they were going to create a truth squad and respond to what was going on in the hearings [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=541.3399999999999s)]
*  and fight back the way we saw them do in the impeachments and other investigations. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=546.78s)]
*  And then they decided, no, we're not going to say anything. We're not going to show up outside and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=551.5s)]
*  try to grab the microphone. We're not going to go rushing to Fox News and say this, that, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=557.26s)]
*  the other thing we'll give interviews to you and MSNBC or go on CNN. They just laid low because [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=561.42s)]
*  they thought that if they do that, they create less conflict and that this, they take the hit [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=566.4599999999999s)]
*  and that it evaporates. The media is very good at letting things evaporate because if no one else [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=572.38s)]
*  is saying anything, you don't know how to cover it because you've covered it already once. And so [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=577.8199999999999s)]
*  the challenge to, I think the media is to try to figure out how to keep this center stage while [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=582.86s)]
*  there are of course other things going on in the world. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTVSfeXKdjo&t=587.98s)]
