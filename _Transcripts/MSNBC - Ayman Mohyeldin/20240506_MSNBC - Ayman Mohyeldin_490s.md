# Al Jazeera Managing Editor: Israel's Shutdown is an Effort to Silence Coverage of Gaza War
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU)
*  We are back with the chilling effect of Israel's shutdown today of Al Jazeera's operations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=0.0s)]
*  in the country and the message it sends just two days after World Press Freedom Day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=4.8s)]
*  With us now, Mohammed Mawad, managing editor of Al Jazeera. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=9.78s)]
*  Mohammed, it's great to have you with us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=13.08s)]
*  We just laid out how today marked a new extreme in Israel's efforts to muzzle Al Jazeera's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=15.44s)]
*  coverage. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=21.6s)]
*  First of all, what is your response to the decision and the actions by the Israeli government [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=22.6s)]
*  in shutting down your organization's operations inside Israel? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=27.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Ayman. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=34.68s)]
*  This is a sad day for all the journalistic community. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=36.04s)]
*  This is an attack on journalism that has started from the beginning of this war. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=42.5s)]
*  The Israeli government has been placing pressure on us, then targeting our journalists directly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  The three of our colleagues were killed covering from the front line by an Israeli airstrike, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=55.56s)]
*  and the intimidation continued with this decision today. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  And we consider it a criminal action by the Israeli government because it violates the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=66.68s)]
*  human rights laws and it's against the human rights and the freedom of expression. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=71.86s)]
*  And we will continue to pursue all legal actions needed to counter this and to make [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=81.28s)]
*  sure that we respond to these baseless allegations against Al Jazeera that we think is an effort [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=87.0s)]
*  to silence our coverage in Gaza and to conceal what's happening there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=93.68s)]
*  And that's why we are not going to weaponize our platform. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=98.08s)]
*  No, we are going to continue the coverage and partial objective coverage of Al Jazeera [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=102.16s)]
*  beginning of this war. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=108.52s)]
*  And that's a commitment that Al Jazeera has taken since the launch of the channel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you just about, if you can, the operations for a minute. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=117.32s)]
*  Can you clarify what territories Israel's shutdown of Al Jazeera means to you? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=120.96s)]
*  As I understand it, the ban is only being enforced inside what is called Israel proper, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=126.6s)]
*  the 1948 line, not the occupied territories of the West Bank, Gaza, or East Jerusalem. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=131.76s)]
*  Where will the ban be enforced exactly and what is your logistical impact on your reporting? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=137.4s)]
*  To be honest, since this decision is politicized, the situation is ambiguous. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=146.76s)]
*  The Israeli government enacted a law that would allow the prime minister and its cabinet, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=154.24s)]
*  and the minister of communication to take actions against Al Jazeera under an emergency law. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=162.12s)]
*  And this allows for a 45 days ban. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=167.32s)]
*  And that kind of ban, which is a very ambiguous kind of word, is enacted according to the government itself. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=172.36s)]
*  They can do it for the Israeli territories only and they can extend it to the Palestinian territories as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=180.6s)]
*  But up until now, the actions that were taken is limited to Israel and Jerusalem. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=188.64s)]
*  That's why you have seen in these images that you have heard before this interview, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=196.2s)]
*  them trying to block our team from covering the news from a remote location. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=202.28s)]
*  This wasn't our office, but rather a room for a live location for our Al Jazeera English team. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=209.0s)]
*  And that goes as well for other locations of Al Jazeera and the main office, of course, in Jerusalem. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=218.0s)]
*  We have an office in Ramallah, the West Bank. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=226.24s)]
*  Up until now, we haven't received anything to indicate that they are going to take action against that office. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=231.0s)]
*  But of course, this ambiguous kind of law and the statement by the government could be weaponized against us, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=236.4s)]
*  as much as the Prime Minister Netanyahu needs. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you about why you think the Israeli government did this from your opinion. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=249.08s)]
*  Because on one hand, Al Jazeera was the first, if not certainly one of the first, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=253.44s)]
*  to broadcast the statements of the Israeli government. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=258.88s)]
*  Many, many years ago, you were the first network to have Israeli officials speak directly to the Arab world. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=262.36s)]
*  Al Jazeera was accused at some times of normalizing Israel in the Arab world. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=268.32s)]
*  And now the Israeli government is shutting you down, saying you are harming national security. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=272.44s)]
*  You're not meeting professional standards that are applied around the world. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=276.96s)]
*  Why do you think Al Jazeera was shut down by the Israeli government after a long history with Israel? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=281.32s)]
*  We have seen this intimidation before in the Arab world with the authoritarian regimes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=291.64s)]
*  They have accused us of violating the security or threatening the national security. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=297.88s)]
*  And the definition of national security has been weaponized against us and used against us [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  to stop us from covering the news and covering the unsavory aspects of government and officials. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=310.04s)]
*  And we have seen that repeating itself now with Israel, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=318.44s)]
*  which is a little surprising because it calls itself a democracy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=323.32s)]
*  But it is the same story and the same argument again. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=327.8s)]
*  We've been banned in some countries the aftermath of the Arab Spring because they claimed we are [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=333.0s)]
*  a threat to the national security. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=341.32s)]
*  And that's the same argument that the Israeli government is using now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=342.92s)]
*  And to your point regarding the Arab world, we've been criticized a lot by the Arab world [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  that we are inviting Israeli officials to be on Al Jazeera. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=353.4s)]
*  And at the same time, here, what contradicts their statement? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=358.2s)]
*  But we continue to invite them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=363.0s)]
*  We continue to interview them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=365.08s)]
*  And however, we know that most of our audiences don't feel comfortable having them on our screen. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=367.0s)]
*  But we are committed to the impartial objective coverage. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=374.92s)]
*  And we continue to invite and interview them as well as invite Hamas leaders and interview [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=379.0s)]
*  them as well. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=386.44s)]
*  And that's our coverage from the beginning of the war. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=387.48s)]
*  AARON MATE-MARTINEZ-MARTINEZ Let me ask you, we have about 45 seconds left, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  but are you concerned what this might mean for other international news organizations [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  operating in Israel? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=397.8s)]
*  Should they be concerned following what happened today to your news organization? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=398.92s)]
*  HASSAN AL-JUBEIR, FORMER UNITED STATES FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF GAZA [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=404.03999999999996s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  And I call upon the international community to take action this time. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=406.2s)]
*  We've seen the killing of our journalists and no one has done anything. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=411.64s)]
*  This time, it is very important because up until now, we are seven months now in this war, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=417.8s)]
*  and more than this. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  And we haven't seen any international journalists entering Gaza. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=426.2s)]
*  And we think that this move is an attempt to silence Al Jazeera and to conceal what's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  happening inside the Gaza Strip and to try to kind of delegitimize our coverage by saying [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=436.91999999999996s)]
*  that we don't operate in Israel. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=444.68s)]
*  But we are committed. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=446.52s)]
*  We are continuing the coverage. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=447.56s)]
*  We make sure that we have all the press conferences out there and all the news out there, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  despite the fact that we don't operate there now, but we have our means of news gathering [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=453.88s)]
*  and we will continue to be committed to the impartiality. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=458.44s)]
*  HAMED MAHWOOD, MANAGER, AL Jazeera [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=461.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=462.44s)]
*  I'm Hamed Mahwood, the managing editor of Al Jazeera in Doha. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=462.92s)]
*  Thank you so much for staying up late for us. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=465.8s)]
*  I greatly appreciate your time and your insights. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxbAZni0wJU&t=467.24s)]
