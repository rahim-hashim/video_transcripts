# Why Trump is 'Nixon on steroids'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM)
*  We want to start tonight's show by looking back for a moment, back to July 27th, 1974, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=0.0s)]
*  which was an inflection point in our country's history. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=10.36s)]
*  It was on that day the House Judiciary Committee recommended that America's 37th President [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=13.76s)]
*  Richard Nixon be impeached and removed from office. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=18.54s)]
*  Six Republicans joined 21 Democrats in sending that first article of impeachment against [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=23.14s)]
*  the president, which accused him of obstructing justice to the full House. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=28.06s)]
*  And now, 49 years later, to the day, another former president has found himself accused [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=34.18s)]
*  of the very same charge again. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=39.62s)]
*  On Thursday, Donald Trump was hit with new counts in special counsel Jack Smith's classified [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=42.76s)]
*  documents case. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=47.56s)]
*  In a bombshell superseding indictment, the ex-president was charged with an additional [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=49.12s)]
*  of willful retention of national defense information and two new counts of obstruction. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=54.06s)]
*  So with these new charges, Trump now faces a staggering total of 40 criminal counts in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=60.02s)]
*  that case, the most serious of which could land him in prison for up to 20 years. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=66.06s)]
*  Now, in that superseding indictment, prosecutors have accused Trump, along with his co-conspirator [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=72.30000000000001s)]
*  Walt Nauta, and a new third defendant, Carlos de Oliveira, a Mar-a-Lago maintenance worker [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=76.9s)]
*  of attempting to delete surveillance video from the resort last summer. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=83.54s)]
*  Now, coincidentally, just after Trump's lawyers received a grand jury subpoena request for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  that footage, according to the indictment on June 27th, 2022, after some phone tag between [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=92.58000000000001s)]
*  Trump, Nauta, and de Oliveira, de Oliveira walked to the IT office at Mar-a-Lago and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=98.98s)]
*  requested that he and an unnamed Trump employee, the resort's director of IT, could talk. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=105.26s)]
*  Well, the two men then went inside a closet, and that's when de Oliveira told the employee [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=112.26s)]
*  that their conversation should, quote, remain between the two of them. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=119.34s)]
*  De Oliveira then asked the employee how many days the resort's servers retained footage, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=124.62s)]
*  to which the employee responded that he believed it was approximately 45 days, give or take. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=130.52s)]
*  And then in a move, honestly, straight out of a mobster movie, de Oliveira told the employee [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=136.12s)]
*  that, quote, the boss wanted the server deleted. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=142.68s)]
*  When the employee raised concerns that he would not know how to do that and that he [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=147.56s)]
*  did not believe that he would have the rights to do so, de Oliveira repeated that, quote, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=151.62s)]
*  the boss wanted the server deleted and asked, what are we going to do? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=158.4s)]
*  Now it's still not entirely clear what happened after that conversation, and honestly, even [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  if the footage was ultimately deleted. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=169.3s)]
*  But with this indictment, the federal government has now accused Donald Trump, a former president, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=172.26s)]
*  of seeking to destroy possibly incriminating evidence against him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=177.32s)]
*  Which brings us back to that Nixon comparison, because Nixon wasn't only just accused of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=182.56s)]
*  obstructing justice, in fact, he was also accused of destroying evidence as part of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=187.96s)]
*  that cover-up during the Watergate scandal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  And during that investigation, it was discovered that Nixon had a habit of recording conversations [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=196.28s)]
*  in the White House, and those recordings were later subpoenaed by a special prosecutor, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=201.28s)]
*  after which investigators noticed an 18 and a half minute gap in one of those tapes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=206.28s)]
*  Now while Nixon's personal secretary claimed to have accidentally erased the missing minutes, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=213.32s)]
*  which are believed to contain a conversation between Nixon and his chief of staff just [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  three days after the Watergate break-in, many suspected it was the president himself who [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=223.64s)]
*  ordered its destruction. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=229.27999999999997s)]
*  But that's where Trump's parallel to the other disgraced ex-president ends, because on August [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  8th, 1974, just 12 days after the House recommended those first articles of impeachment, Richard [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  Nixon, faced with the overwhelming evidence against him and eroding support within his [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=243.64s)]
*  own party, he resigned. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=248.32s)]
*  Donald Trump isn't ready to give up. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=252.2s)]
*  He's not going anywhere. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  Here he is just yesterday doubling down on his commitment to retake the White House no [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  matter what may stand in his way. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=260.08s)]
*  If going forward, right, you get these indictments, there ends up, you got a jury in DC, you get [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=264.4s)]
*  convicted and sentenced. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=270.76s)]
*  Does that stop your campaign for president if you're sentenced? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=273.24s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  There's nothing in the Constitution to say that it could and not at all. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  And even the radical left crazys are saying, no, that wouldn't stop. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=286.36s)]
*  And it wouldn't stop me either. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=290.52s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=293.16s)]
*  Now as more details continue to emerge about the sheer scope of Donald Trump's alleged [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=294.16s)]
*  criminality and the possible coverup that followed, it is becoming clear that he is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=298.92s)]
*  in a league of his own. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump isn't just another Richard Nixon. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=306.6s)]
*  He's Nixon on steroids. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=309.8s)]
*  . [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqKlMh60TLM&t=328.92s)]
