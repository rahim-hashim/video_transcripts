# Rep. Raskin: “the highest court in the land has the lowest ethical standards.”
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM)
*  A dispute between neighbors is the latest scandal to rock the nation's highest court. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=0.0s)]
*  And let's go back to late 2020 when despite the fact that Donald Trump had just lost the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=5.2s)]
*  presidential election, the soon to be ex-president and his supporters were in the midst of trying [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=9.76s)]
*  to overturn Joe Biden's victory across the country. Of course, you may remember political [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=15.52s)]
*  tensions were running very high, including a normally quiet suburban cul-de-sac in Fairfax [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=20.64s)]
*  County, Virginia. Well, after attending a protest, a woman's adult daughter returned home to that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=26.16s)]
*  suburb and propped up several political signs against Bush's in the front yard. Now, it's not [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=31.84s)]
*  known exactly what was written on those signs, but according to a neighbor, one had Trump's name on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=37.68s)]
*  it with an expletive and the other carried a message along the lines of, quote, you are complicit. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=43.28s)]
*  What is known, however, is that the signs caused a heated exchange between the woman's daughter [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=49.92s)]
*  and another neighbor. In an act of retaliation, that neighbor responded to the young woman's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=55.6s)]
*  political statement by making one of her own, displaying an upside down American flag on her [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=60.64s)]
*  property. The inverted flag had become a symbol of the stop the steal movement used by Trump [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=67.6s)]
*  supporters who denied the legitimacy of Joe Biden's victory. But there was just one problem with this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=73.04s)]
*  overtly political statement from that resident in Virginia. She was the wife of Supreme Court [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=78.72s)]
*  Justice Samuel Alito. According to the New York Times, the photo of that flag outside Alito's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=84.8s)]
*  residence was taken on January 17th, 2021, just weeks after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=90.24s)]
*  and days before Joe Biden was inaugurated as president. It was also the same time period that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=97.12s)]
*  the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up a case brought by Trump allies challenging [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Pennsylvania's mail-in voting system, a case that would have had direct implications on the outcome [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=108.4s)]
*  of the 2020 election. At the time, Alito was in favor of reviewing the case, but the majority [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=113.84s)]
*  actually decided against it. And the report also raises fresh concerns over Alito's impartiality [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  as the court is currently considering two important January 6 related cases, including whether or not [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=124.08s)]
*  the former president, Donald Trump, has absolute immunity for his efforts to overturn the 2020 [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=130.0s)]
*  election. Judicial experts told the Times that the flag was a clear violation of ethics rules, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=135.68s)]
*  which seek to avoid even the appearance of bias and could sow doubt about Justice Alito's possible [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=141.28s)]
*  bias in cases related to the election and the Capitol ride. For his part, though, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=148.0s)]
*  this is how Samuel Alito responded. He told the New York Times, quote, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=154.4s)]
*  I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag. It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=158.16s)]
*  response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=164.48s)]
*  Now, of course, you probably noticed missing from that statement is any sort of denial that the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=171.36s)]
*  flag was flown in solidarity with the insurrectionists or any attempts by sitting US Supreme Court [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=175.76s)]
*  justice to somehow disavow the insurrectionists lie that the 2020 election was stolen. But this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=182.24s)]
*  story is about much more than an inverted flag because we are still living in the shadow of the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=188.8s)]
*  2020 election and the violent insurrection that followed. While this reporting is coming to light [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=194.88s)]
*  now and while we're still waiting to see if Donald Trump will ever be held accountable for [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=199.92s)]
*  what he did, the threat the ex-president and his acolytes posed to our democracy is hardly in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=204.88s)]
*  past. From the Supreme Court to the Senate, Trump and his allies are playing plainly, laying the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=211.11999999999998s)]
*  groundwork for another January six right in front of our eyes. In fact, just this morning, Florida [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=217.6s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio refused to commit to accept the results of the next election. Watch. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  Will you accept the election results of 2024 no matter what happens, Senator? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=227.76s)]
*  No matter what happens? No, if it's an unfair election, I think it's going to be contested by [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=234.0s)]
*  your side. But this effort again goes far beyond sowing seeds of doubt in our election system. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=237.52s)]
*  Trump's allies are working to reshape our democracy, taking inspiration from autocrats [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=244.24s)]
*  like Hungary's Viktor Orban. Again, here's Senator JD Vance praising Orban just earlier today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=249.2s)]
*  But Viktor Orban in particular, as you know, I mean he rewrote the constitution, he neutered [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=257.76s)]
*  the courts, he has tried to control the media. These are not necessarily conservative principles, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=262.55999999999995s)]
*  so why would you want to mimic him? Well look, I'm not endorsing every single thing that Viktor [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=268.4s)]
*  Orban has ever done. I don't know everything he's ever done. What I do think is on the university, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=272.4s)]
*  on the university principle, the idea that taxpayers should have some influence and how [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=276.64s)]
*  their money is spent at these universities, it's a totally reasonable thing and I do think that he's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  made some smart decisions there that we could learn from the United States. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=285.52s)]
*  Not just senators auditioning to be potentially Trump vice presidential picks, it's Trump himself. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=289.44s)]
*  Just last night he took another page out of the authoritarian handbook, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=294.96s)]
*  floating the possibility of a three-term presidency, something that is barred under our US constitution. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=298.64s)]
*  You know, FDR, 16 years, almost 16 years, he was four term. I don't know, are we going to be [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  considered three term or two term? It was three years ago that rioters stormed the capital and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=313.76s)]
*  attempted to assault our democracy on January the 6th and now with less than six months to the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=319.84s)]
*  election, fascism is at the gates and Donald Trump and his acolytes are ready to finish the job. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  Just a short time ago I had the chance to speak with Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  about the crisis at our nation's highest court and more. Congressman Raskin, thank you so much [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=335.76s)]
*  for joining us. Let's start with this reporting from the New York Times. I'm just curious to get [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=341.28s)]
*  your response to it, to Justice Alito's comments that he had no involvement and that it was his [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=346.0s)]
*  wife's choice to hang that inverted flag. Is that a good enough excuse for a sitting Supreme Court [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  justice? Well, look, if we had a binding ethics code on the Supreme Court, somebody would be able [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=359.2s)]
*  to complain about it and then there would be a real investigation rather than just [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=368.72s)]
*  dueling press releases and press statements. I would think that for a sitting justice of the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  United States Supreme Court, somebody in your neighborhood putting up an anti-Trump sign [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=380.48s)]
*  doesn't really justify a Supreme Court justice inverting the flag of the United States and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=387.36s)]
*  sending out a symbol of distress. But again, the real issue is that we don't have a system [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=393.44s)]
*  for dealing with that kind of problem, but in the political symbolism of America now, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=399.84s)]
*  it makes sense to me. I mean, Donald Trump turned the Bible upside down. Justice Alito [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=406.32s)]
*  turned the flag upside down. MAGA has been trying to turn the Constitution and the rule of law upside [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=412.0s)]
*  down. So we're in a struggle for just the basic integrity of our political system. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=418.0s)]
*  You bring up a very important point about the ethics rules, which is a big problem now, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=423.52s)]
*  as we've seen with this Supreme Court. And because it's not subject to any binding ethics rule, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=428.88s)]
*  you have introduced legislation to fix that problem, the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=434.4s)]
*  Realistically speaking, is there a path forward for that bill with this modern day Republican party? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=440.0s)]
*  No, not in this Congress. They're not interested in it. And of course, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=448.8s)]
*  they don't think there's any problem with the Supreme Court, which has overthrown women's right [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=452.8s)]
*  to choose an abortion, which has been trying to undercut the effectiveness of our administrative [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=458.48s)]
*  agencies like the EPA and has been in a full-blown assault on the voting rights of the people. So [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=463.76s)]
*  they like what this reactionary court has been doing. So they're not going to hear it. But right [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  now we have a situation where the highest court in the land has the lowest ethical standards. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=479.52s)]
*  It's literally the only court in the land in the federal judiciary or in the state system, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=485.76s)]
*  which does not have a binding ethics code in a way to complain if justice completely violates [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=492.08s)]
*  the basic principles of judging. And in the absence of any kind of meaningful [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  reform or accountability, the question now is what should happen? You've got chairman of the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=506.32s)]
*  Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin, calling on Alito to recuse himself. But you also have [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=513.12s)]
*  respected constitutional law professor at Harvard, Lawrence Tribe, saying that's simply not enough. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=518.48s)]
*  He says talk is cheap. Chairman Dick Durbin needs to do more than call on Alito to recuse himself [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=524.48s)]
*  from the insurrection cases. Durbin needs to step up and use the subpoena power to demand Alito's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=530.88s)]
*  appearance and explanation before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Do you, sir, agree with [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=536.96s)]
*  Lawrence Tribe? Should Alito be subpoenaed to appear before Congress? Well, all of this is an [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=542.4s)]
*  attempt to compensate for the utter inadequacy of the current system because there is no binding [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=549.84s)]
*  ethics code or nowhere you can go to complain. So certainly demands for recusal make absolute [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=556.24s)]
*  sense across the board by citizens, by members of the House and the Senate. And if the Senate can [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=564.0s)]
*  render subpoenas to have the justice come and testify about his alleged neutrality and objectivity, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=574.16s)]
*  that would be great. But, you know, I don't hold out a lot of hope for any of those things happening. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=582.4s)]
*  The problem with the subpoena power on the Senate side, of course, is that in order to enforce such [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=591.28s)]
*  a subpoena, you need 60 votes. The Democrats have only 51 votes. So I don't know whether or not [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=595.76s)]
*  they'll want to go down that road. But the public at least needs to be understanding [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=602.88s)]
*  what's taking place here. There's an absolute collapse of the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=607.76s)]
*  You've got billionaire sugar daddies who are paying for, you know, justices' private school [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=613.6s)]
*  tuitions and their cars and mortgages and just crazy stuff going on. And then you have a complete [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=619.68s)]
*  inversion of basic constitutional concepts and an abandonment of the Supreme Court role when it comes [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=628.0s)]
*  to something like Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, whose meaning could not be plainer if you've sworn [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=635.68s)]
*  an oath to uphold the Constitution and you violate it by engaging in insurrection. You can never hold [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  federal or state office again, but the Supreme Court has done everything that it can to just [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=646.8s)]
*  obliterate the meaning of that passage. Let me also, if I can, pivot and get your thoughts on [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=651.3599999999999s)]
*  something that was also said today that was extremely troubling. And I just want to get [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=656.16s)]
*  your reaction to it as a member of Congress. These are comments from Senator Marco Rubio [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=660.96s)]
*  earlier today, the Senator refusing to say whether he would accept the results of the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQy_ccR1KLM&t=665.76s)]
