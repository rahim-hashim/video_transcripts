# Michael Moore on Biden's advisers: 'There's a form of elder abuse going on'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc)
*  Academy Award-winning filmmaker Michael Moore is not only calling on President Biden to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=0.0s)]
*  drop out of the race in a July 4th essay, he writes that it is time for Biden to step [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=5.0s)]
*  down and for Vice President Kamala Harris to take the reins. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=9.46s)]
*  He is also host of The Rumble with Michael Moore podcast, and he joins me now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=13.16s)]
*  Michael, it's good to have you back on the show. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=17.48s)]
*  You have some harsh words in this piece that you wrote, not as much of it directed at Biden, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  but at those around him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=25.0s)]
*  Tell us, please, why you see it that way. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=27.12s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=29.12s)]
*  The first thing I want to say is I've been sitting in the green room, virtual green room, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  here at MSNBC, and the Lord Almighty is actually back there, sitting in the room. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  And he will not tell us anything about what's going on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  He's only weirdly concerned with the slump that the Yankees have been in for the last month. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  So I just I like the Lord. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=56.12s)]
*  Lord, Biden just said last night, you have you're the decider. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=60.12s)]
*  You decide if he stays or goes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=64.12s)]
*  And he's like, leave me out of this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=67.12s)]
*  OK, you know, want me to walk on water? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=69.12s)]
*  I can do that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=71.12s)]
*  Want me to turn a bunch of loaves of bread and fish into feeding thousands? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=72.12s)]
*  I can do that. But don't ask me to get involved in this crazy election. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=77.12s)]
*  Here's listen, I think that, yes, I I need to start by saying and of course, I've been very critical of President Biden, especially since October with the war and very disappointed. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=81.12s)]
*  But this individual has been the most progressive president that we've had in my lifetime. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=95.12s)]
*  Three and a half years. Just you just look at the record. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=103.12s)]
*  I don't need to go. I hope I don't go over it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=105.12s)]
*  But what he's done to stand up for how he got us through covid, he got us through covid by using science and vaccines. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=108.12s)]
*  He he he removed. And I said this back in the green room, he removed the devil in 2020. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=118.12s)]
*  I mean, just go down the list. But the problem here is, is that I think there's a form of elder abuse going on here where the Democratic Party and the people, the people that are part of the apparatus pushing and pushing and pushing him to stay. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=125.12s)]
*  And then he comes out and he says, I'm staying and the family says I'm staying. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=142.12s)]
*  And and I don't know about you, Amon, but in spite of my criticisms about Gaza with Biden, watching the debate a week ago was heartbreaking. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=147.12s)]
*  It was I just and it was like imagine that was your father up there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=159.12s)]
*  What would you want to I think? Why is anybody doing anything? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=164.12s)]
*  Why didn't they do it? Why did they even let him go out on the stage in this condition? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=168.12s)]
*  Who is looking out for him? Yeah, who's looking out for him right now? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=172.12s)]
*  You know, George asked those questions like I said, and he had to ask it three or four times. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=175.12s)]
*  Will you just get a checkup, a medical evaluation, a neurologist, you know, to something doesn't seem right. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=180.12s)]
*  And we're not doctors, but each of us, all of you watching this right now have had or have in your life for grandparents and two parents. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=188.12s)]
*  There's at least six. You've got step parents and step grad. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=199.12s)]
*  We all have seen the decline of the people we love as they get older. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=202.12s)]
*  It's normal. It happens. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=207.12s)]
*  That's not to say that somebody shouldn't be able to be president in 81. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=210.12s)]
*  I don't believe that. I mean, look at Ben Franklin. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=214.12s)]
*  Look at all the people throughout our history that did quite well into their 80s. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=218.12s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi is older than Biden. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=222.12s)]
*  So clearly, this is not an ageist attitude here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=225.12s)]
*  This is more like something was wrong that night. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=230.12s)]
*  We all saw it. We can't unsee it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=233.12s)]
*  And as Richard Pryor and before that, Chico Marx said, who are you going to believe? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=236.12s)]
*  Me or your own lying eyes? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=242.12s)]
*  You know, my eyes weren't lying and yours weren't either. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=245.12s)]
*  It's a very important point that you bring up because I think there's also another elephant in the room here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=248.12s)]
*  And in all of the calls that we have seen for President Biden to step aside, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=254.12s)]
*  the issue of what is happening or has been happening in Gaza has not been mentioned, has taken a back seat. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=259.12s)]
*  But you address this. You address this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=264.12s)]
*  You address Gaza in your piece. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=267.12s)]
*  And should Biden's decision making on Gaza have been a warning sign about him long before his bad debate performance, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=269.12s)]
*  which is something that I was looking at as well and saying like, hey, there's something off in the decision making here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=276.12s)]
*  If you're seeing what is happening across America and still being intransigent and pursuing the same policy with no change, of course. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=282.12s)]
*  I've been saying this since the last week of October. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=289.12s)]
*  I've said it on this network that there's a real problem now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=292.12s)]
*  And I don't think people understand what the problem is. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=296.12s)]
*  But the first time losing young people. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=299.12s)]
*  See, the thing about young people is they don't like war. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=302.12s)]
*  They don't like any war, probably because they're the ones that are going to have to go fight the war. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=305.12s)]
*  So they're generally against the war to begin with. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=310.12s)]
*  But I come from a state, Michigan, where there are 200 to 300 thousand voters who are either of Arabic descent or are Muslim. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=313.12s)]
*  Two hundred to three hundred thousand Arab and or Muslim voters. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=324.12s)]
*  And the Arab American Institute took a poll the last week of October when the real attack and slaughter started on the part of Netanyahu in Gaza. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=329.12s)]
*  And that poll showed and this poll with four states that have Arab populations, Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=339.12s)]
*  And the poll said that the people were binding on about 60 percent of the Arab vote back in 2000. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=347.12s)]
*  As of the last week of October, that had dropped to people were saying for the November election coming up, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=357.12s)]
*  less than 20 percent of Arab Americans are going to vote for Biden this time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=364.12s)]
*  That was the end of October. They did another poll at the end of May just a month and a half ago. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=369.12s)]
*  Same number. Down less than 20 percent of Arab Americans. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=375.12s)]
*  You cannot have in the state of Michigan 300000 voters that are Arab or Muslim. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=381.12s)]
*  And expect when they're telling you not only that, vast numbers of them are saying that they're not even going to show up to vote. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=387.12s)]
*  And the funny thing about Trump's numbers with Arab American voters in the same poll, he got one third of the Arab American vote in 2020. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=394.12s)]
*  Trump and today by this poll in May, he's still he's still at one third. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=402.12s)]
*  He hasn't gone up or down. But but the fact that Biden is not going to get and that people are going to stay home [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=409.12s)]
*  and young people, young people, they did a poll of young people recently and it said 12 percent of them plan on they're going to vote, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=415.12s)]
*  but they're not going to vote on the top line for president. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=423.12s)]
*  And in Michigan in 2016, this is the year that Trump won Michigan by two votes per precinct over Hillary. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=426.12s)]
*  And in 2016, there were seventy five thousand Michiganders who actually showed up to vote but refused to vote on the top line. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=435.12s)]
*  And there were mostly people in Democratic precincts. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=447.12s)]
*  They didn't want to vote for Hillary and by not doing Hillary lost Michigan by 10000 votes. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=450.12s)]
*  You make such a compelling point about the politics of this, which is something Joe Biden has prided himself on being an astute politician, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=455.12s)]
*  somebody that he says with his age, he has learned over decades of experience that you have to be an astute politician to kind of thread that needle and pick up these swing states. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=463.12s)]
*  Politico reported this week that the governor of your state, Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=472.12s)]
*  warned the White House that the critical swing state is no longer winnable. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=477.12s)]
*  As soon as that was reported, Whitmer's team denied it and said that Biden was going to win Michigan. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=481.12s)]
*  And of course, I go back to what again you were just saying this, but you warned famously back in 2016 that Trump was going to win the White House by winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=487.12s)]
*  Should the alarm bells be going off right now in the White House politically speaking? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=497.12s)]
*  Forget the argument about age. Forget the argument about Gaza. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=501.12s)]
*  You are in the state of the moral argument about Gaza. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=504.12s)]
*  Forget the moral argument. I'm just talking about politically right now. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=507.12s)]
*  Yes. This is what's so bizarre. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=510.12s)]
*  And I think Governor Whitmer, I don't know why she walked back. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=512.12s)]
*  Maybe she feels differently. I don't know. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=516.12s)]
*  But it is how most people who follow politics in Michigan believe that it's almost unwinnable. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=518.12s)]
*  Now, Michelle Goldberg in a column three months ago, the headline was lose Michigan, lose the election. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=524.12s)]
*  It was that she spent a number of days there in the Detroit area in Dearborn around talking to a lot of Arab Americans in Michigan and was clear to her very clear that this is a lost state for Biden. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=532.12s)]
*  That didn't have to be that way. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=547.12s)]
*  I mean, he won. He won by she said what was over 100,000 votes in Michigan in 2020. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=549.12s)]
*  The fact that he would lose and possibly lose this number of Arab and Muslim votes and young people who young people did the same thing on the campuses all spring in Michigan. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=556.12s)]
*  The difference between Michigan and Columbia or UCLA is Governor Whitmer didn't send in the state police to beat up students. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=569.12s)]
*  Students didn't tear down. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=578.12s)]
*  Eventually, it went to court. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=580.12s)]
*  Eventually, it had to come down. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=582.12s)]
*  But not till not till pretty much the school year was over. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=584.12s)]
*  But that's Michigan that she knows. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=587.12s)]
*  And I think that's something I don't get about Biden. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=590.12s)]
*  What is the any in any politician's mind? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=594.12s)]
*  What is their number one job? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=597.12s)]
*  Yet reelected, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=599.12s)]
*  No matter what. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=601.12s)]
*  Right. And the fact that he would decide to hug Netanyahu to go there and tell him as the tape you just showed in November, just people wanting to cease fire. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=603.12s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=614.12s)]
*  No, he goes. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=615.12s)]
*  No, this has, I think, really rattled people in my state and why he would purposely do this. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=616.12s)]
*  It's it's another sign that something isn't quite right here because his political instincts are off. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=628.12s)]
*  And I just I don't I don't know. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=636.12s)]
*  I think that we're in a lot of trouble now. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=640.12s)]
*  If you'd asked me a year ago this week, if I was on your show, then and you know, how do I think Michigan will go? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=643.12s)]
*  I would say I would have said to you, not only do I think this about Michigan, I think Biden's going to get reelected. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=650.12s)]
*  I don't care where the polls are at. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=656.12s)]
*  I just think that Trump lost by not just the seven million to Biden. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=658.12s)]
*  There were 10 million. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=663.12s)]
*  You got to throw the third party voters in. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=664.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=666.12s)]
*  A million Americans that said we don't want Trump for Trump to win this time. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=667.12s)]
*  That means he's got to convince at least five million of them to switch their votes. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=672.12s)]
*  That ain't happening. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=678.12s)]
*  He's got to convince them to stay home. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=679.12s)]
*  Well, now, after the debate, after what he's done in Palestine, now there's a problem. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=681.12s)]
*  And I wouldn't I would not say to you that this is a sure bet that Trump is not going to get back in the White House. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=690.12s)]
*  And that is my personal number one job is to stop Trump to make sure he doesn't come back to the White House. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=695.12s)]
*  We are in deep, deep, deep trouble. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=702.12s)]
*  We're going to have these. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=704.12s)]
*  Michael, I'll pick up on a point that I wanted to raise. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=705.12s)]
*  It's the sound bite that I played earlier of of President Joe Biden talking about the stakes of the election here in 2024 when George [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=708.12s)]
*  F. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=718.12s)]
*  Anopoulos basically asked him, you know, what do you say if Donald Trump wins and everything you are worried about and everything you have been warning about comes to fruition? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=719.12s)]
*  And he said, well, I did my best. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=727.12s)]
*  I did my goodest. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=729.12s)]
*  Actually, I gave it my all. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=730.12s)]
*  I did. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=733.12s)]
*  I swear to God, this sounds like I had a colonoscopy a couple of months ago. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=734.12s)]
*  And, you know, they put you out and just as you're like, you're counting backward from 10. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=738.12s)]
*  I just looked up at the doctor. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=743.12s)]
*  I said, hey, I'm going to come back. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=744.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=746.12s)]
*  And he says, well, I'm going to do my best and I'm going to give it my all. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=747.12s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=751.12s)]
*  And then a month later, I go to my niece's wedding. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=753.12s)]
*  I'm walking on the plane. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=756.12s)]
*  I see the I always say hi to the pilots. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=758.12s)]
*  I stick my head in. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=759.12s)]
*  How's it going in there? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=760.12s)]
*  How's it going today? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=761.12s)]
*  The pilot says, well, you know, I'm going to give it my best. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=762.12s)]
*  You know, I'm giving my best shot to get us to Cleveland. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=766.12s)]
*  No, no, you don't say something like that when you're the president of the United States. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=769.12s)]
*  There's more at stake here than to just say, well, you know, at least I'll feel like I gave it my all. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=775.12s)]
*  I just, you know, by the way, the colonoscopy doctor and the pilot, you know, I just think MSNBC every now and then should be a momentous moment. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=780.12s)]
*  And I just know what I'm serious. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=790.12s)]
*  I'm so upset. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=795.12s)]
*  It definitely was a moment. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=796.12s)]
*  I know. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=798.12s)]
*  And listen, it was a moment. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=799.12s)]
*  And that's why we highlighted it, because it was also a moment that I thought was a little bit beneath the moment that we are in in this in this crisis. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=800.12s)]
*  You have Project 2025. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=807.12s)]
*  You have fascism at the doorstep of America. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=808.12s)]
*  It's not about giving your all. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=811.12s)]
*  It's about making sure that this country survives every possible chance that you have. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Zl2y0KqPc&t=812.12s)]
