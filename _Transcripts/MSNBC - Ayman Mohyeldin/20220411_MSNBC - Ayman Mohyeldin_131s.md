# Arizona Still Caught In Trump’s “Big Lie” Despite No Evidence Of Widespread Fraud
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64)
*  More than a year after the 2020 presidential election, a lot of Republicans are still pretending [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=0.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump won an election we all know he did not win. We don't need more evidence [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=5.92s)]
*  to tell us that. But, this week, we got a lot more of it, more from a Republican. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=12.16s)]
*  Arizona Attorney General Mark Bernanovich issued an interim report that found no evidence [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=18.32s)]
*  of widespread election fraud in Maricopa County in 2020. Now, it's actually kind of funny [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=23.32s)]
*  because Bernanovich said the same thing just days after the 2020 election. He said there [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=28.2s)]
*  was no evidence of fraud. But Trump didn't like that. And so, Bernanovich gave into him [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=34.8s)]
*  and other Arizona Republicans, and he actually launched this investigation. Now, because [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  he's a Republican, Bernanovich still claimed that there were serious vulnerabilities in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=46.56s)]
*  election procedures that raised questions. Okay. But he never reconciled how there could [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=51.56s)]
*  be such serious vulnerabilities if those vulnerabilities never actually resulted in any fraud. I mean, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=58.36s)]
*  is anything really that vulnerable then? And lest we forget, this isn't the first time [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=66.68s)]
*  Arizona has had its 2020 election results reviewed. Last year, the GOP hired an independent [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=71.64s)]
*  contractor, infamously known as the Cyber Ninjas. Yes, that is their real name, to quote, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=77.4s)]
*  unquote, audit the final vote tally in Maricopa County. And Cyber Ninjas found that President [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=82.76s)]
*  Biden actually received more votes than what was officially awarded to him in 2020. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=89.12s)]
*  Now, of course, we didn't need Cyber Ninjas telling us there was no fraud. We just could [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  have listened to the 2020 version of the attorney general before he changed his fraud claims [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=100.12s)]
*  to kowtow to the man who lost and still is not the president. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVu8mtXo64&t=106.16s)]
