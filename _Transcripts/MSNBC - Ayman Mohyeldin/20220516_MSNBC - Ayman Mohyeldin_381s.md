# Rebuilding Life in Ukraine As War Stretches Into Third Month
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY)
*  Tonight, in our coverage of the war in Ukraine, we want to focus on the Ukrainian people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=0.0s)]
*  because we don't ever want to lose sight of the people suffering because of Putin's invasion. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=6.44s)]
*  Earlier, I spoke with Inessa. She's a resident of Kiev who fled the capital with her husband [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=11.68s)]
*  when the war broke out. But to protect her identity, we've agreed not to reveal her surname [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=16.56s)]
*  or her location. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=21.76s)]
*  Inessa, thank you so much for joining us. You were in Kiev at the start of the war. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=24.720000000000002s)]
*  What was the breaking point that made you decide to leave? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  Probably panic and the fact that I got left with my grandmother who couldn't at the time [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=35.08s)]
*  care for herself because she was too old. And basically panic and probably the thought [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=43.64s)]
*  that, you know, it's kind of preconceptions that everyone thinks that if you're further [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=50.2s)]
*  from civilization, you're safer. So we decided to move just outside Kiev as far as we could [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=55.6s)]
*  at that moment. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  And as I understand it, you have moved several times since then with your husband and your [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=67.48s)]
*  two dogs. You're now living in a small village where I understand you are working remotely [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=72.44s)]
*  as a translator. What does this new normal feel like for you? I mean, do you feel safe [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=78.2s)]
*  compared to where you were previously? Do you still feel that your life is in danger, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  even though perhaps the fighting has shifted to the eastern part of the country? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  Probably both. I do feel safer because I'm totally different environment, which help [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  to psychologically adjust a bit. I don't hear the fighting, which helps as well, but I feel [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=103.96s)]
*  probably really homesick. And at the moment, I cannot go back to Kiev because of problems [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=111.56s)]
*  with fuel in our country. So it's quite difficult to move around at this moment. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=120.12s)]
*  I'm curious to know if the experience that you've had during your experience, have you [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=127.08s)]
*  seen what Russian troops are doing in Ukraine? Were you able to see that personally in some [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=132.68s)]
*  capacity? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=138.44s)]
*  Probably in more capacity than I would ever want to, because the first day our village [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=140.76s)]
*  got taken by Russian troops, my house was shelled with two bombs. I still don't know [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=149.24s)]
*  how we survived, but we did. And at some point they came to my house with all the people [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=156.52s)]
*  with guns searching for valuables. So basically, a marauding. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=163.96s)]
*  And do you think that you will ever return to Kiev? You said that your house was demolished [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that the house is salvageable? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=176.68s)]
*  Well, fortunately, as it was my mother and father, well, fortunately, so to speak, a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=185.0s)]
*  guest house, which we usually live in when we come to their village. So while it's not [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  salvageable, it's just total devastation. So it was total ruins because it's a small wooden [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=197.4s)]
*  house that got hit two times simultaneously. So only some part of the middle is left more [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=205.24s)]
*  or less intact. And luckily, we were in that middle at the time when the bombs hit. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  We try on this show to hear from as many Ukrainians as possible. I'm curious to get your [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=220.84s)]
*  thoughts about how you view the Ukrainian government's handling of the war and the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  lead up to the war. How do you think President Zelensky is doing so far in the middle of this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=232.28s)]
*  conflict? Well, so far, as most as I can see, I'm no specialist, I'm not a military specialist, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=238.28s)]
*  but what I'm seeing now, we are still alive. Most of the country is still can function at [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=249.16s)]
*  some capacity, although we do have lots of problems and lots of people had to leave their [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=256.28s)]
*  homes and lots of houses, infrastructure was damaged, but it is working. It is still [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=261.8s)]
*  people have stuff to do. Some of them have jobs and probably it's, I guess, a positive thing [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  in this capacity. And finally, let me just ask you for our viewers who may not get a chance to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  hear from Ukrainians directly. What message do you have for the American people with everything [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=289.4s)]
*  that is happening in your country? What would you like our viewers to know about what either they [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  can do, what the American government can do or what you want more help with? Well, at this point, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=301.64s)]
*  Ukrainian people need any help we can get. There are lots of areas where the humanitarian help is [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=309.32s)]
*  needed, like basic necessities like food, like shelter. Currently, I know that some companies [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=317.08s)]
*  are trying to build temporary shelters for those who had to leave their damaged regions. And [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=324.44s)]
*  any help matters, I guess, right now, even a small part. If you have anything to help, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=332.44s)]
*  any kind of thing, any even small amount, it really makes a difference here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=339.0s)]
*  All right, Anessa, thank you so much for sharing your story with us. Please stay safe. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=347.96s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. You too. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=353.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBT0xtp1pY&t=377.08s)]
