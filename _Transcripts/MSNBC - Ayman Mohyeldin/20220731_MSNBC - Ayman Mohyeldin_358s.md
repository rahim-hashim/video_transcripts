Video Description: Democrats have long struggled to play on an equal playing field with Republicans when it comes to messaging campaigns. Between the power of Fox News and the brazenness of GOP fear-mongering, Democrat talking points rarely get through to voters. However, some new progressive figures are developing new ways to connect with the American people. As MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin explains, Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and California Governor Gavin Newsom have, in recent weeks, displayed uncanny messaging savvy. Their strategies are bold, clever, and – most importantly – they seem to be working.

# Democrats Finally Get Their Messaging Act Together
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU)
*  As long as I have been alive, I have known three certainties in life, death, taxes, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats, terrible at messaging. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=8.52s)]
*  Now, I don't see much changing about the first two, but Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=10.88s)]
*  John Federman is trying to change the last one with a new approach to the state Senate [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=14.68s)]
*  race. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=19.72s)]
*  It's playful. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=20.72s)]
*  It's snarky. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=21.72s)]
*  And, honestly, it seems to be working. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=22.72s)]
*  Federman's campaign has drowned his Republican opponent, TV personality Mehmet Oz, with [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=24.96s)]
*  a torrent of Twitter memes mocking Oz for living most of his life across the river in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=29.32s)]
*  New Jersey. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=35.08s)]
*  In fact, check out this latest ad featuring former Sopranos star and E Street band guitarist [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=36.08s)]
*  Steve Van Zandt. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=40.92s)]
*  Yo, Dr. Oz, Stevie Veezy here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=41.92s)]
*  What are you doing in Pennsylvania? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=44.92s)]
*  Everybody knows you live in New Jersey and you're just using your in-laws address over [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=55.6s)]
*  And you do not want to mess around with John Federman. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=56.88s)]
*  Trust me, he's a little out of your league. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  Nobody wants to see you get embarrassed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=62.08s)]
*  So come on back to Jersey where you belong and we'll have some fun. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=64.64s)]
*  Now we'll go to the beach. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=68.84s)]
*  We'll go surfing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=70.0s)]
*  You know, come on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=71.0s)]
*  Now, Federman's not alone in his quest to change the Democrats' messaging around the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=72.0s)]
*  midterms and these races. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom has been running full page ads in Texas newspapers targeting Republican [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=82.12s)]
*  Governor Greg Abbott's strict abortion policies. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=87.76s)]
*  And earlier this month, he mocked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in TV commercials urging [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=90.76s)]
*  Floridians to move to California. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=95.72s)]
*  Joining me now is Anant Shankar Osorio, host of the Words to Win By podcast and founder [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=99.0s)]
*  of ASO Communications. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=104.32s)]
*  Anant, it's great to have you with us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=105.32s)]
*  What is it about the messaging strategies of John Federman and Gavin Newsom that are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=108.12s)]
*  resonating and so appealing and making them go viral, so to speak? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=112.68s)]
*  Yeah, they are basically hitting all of the hallmarks of really effective persuasion, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=117.68s)]
*  which we know from political messaging experiments and just years and years and years of study [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  of what is persuasive, namely, say what you're for and draw a contrast. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=128.96s)]
*  I often tell people if you want people to come to your cause, you need to be attractive. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=134.36s)]
*  And so you can think about a theory of persuasion as magnetism. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=140.08s)]
*  And like a magnet, you need to draw people towards you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  But that also includes having a polarity, which means that you're repelling certain [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  people. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=153.12s)]
*  And that is a hallmark of both what Federman and Newsom are doing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=154.12s)]
*  They are standing for something and they are drawing an incredibly clear and potent [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=158.28000000000003s)]
*  contrast against their opposition and really spelling out everything that they represent [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=163.76s)]
*  and the dangers that they represent to the American people or to the people of their [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=170.32s)]
*  respective states. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=174.28s)]
*  Let me play for you and our viewers another viral ad from the Federman campaign. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=176.7s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=180.72s)]
*  Hey, Maymet. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=181.72s)]
*  This is Nicole Snuckye. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=182.72s)]
*  And I'm from Jersey Shore. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=183.72s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen of it before, but I'm a hot mess on a reality show basically, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=184.72s)]
*  but I heard that you moved from New Jersey to Pennsylvania to look for a new job. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=193.72s)]
*  And personally, I don't know why anyone would want to leave Jersey because it's like the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=200.16s)]
*  best place ever. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=204.36s)]
*  And we're all hot messes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=205.36s)]
*  But I want to say best of luck to you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=207.56s)]
*  I know you're away from home and you're in a new place, but Jersey will not forget you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=209.84s)]
*  I just want to let you know. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=214.56s)]
*  So the genius of this ad is, you know, it's funny. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  It's using celebritydom, if you will, to resonate to younger people who may be familiar with [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=223.48s)]
*  who Snuckye is and the Jersey Shore. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  But what is the underlying message here that is making it work for the Federman campaign [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=231.78s)]
*  to basically say Mehmet Az is an outsider. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=238.12s)]
*  He's not one of us. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=242.32s)]
*  He doesn't represent the interests of Pennsylvania. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=243.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, the deep irony of this, right, is that a better man, of course, is sort of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  a classic. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=250.04s)]
*  I mean, in the photo that you showed of him, he's wearing the cargo shorts. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=251.04s)]
*  He's wearing the sweatshirt. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=254.84s)]
*  He doesn't look at all like a politician that you're accustomed to. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=255.84s)]
*  But he's a white dude. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=260.1s)]
*  He's a big white burly dude. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=261.1s)]
*  And what he is proving, ironically, is that all politics is identity politics. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=263.58s)]
*  And what he's doing is he's creating a state level patriotism. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  He's in essence saying there is a Pennsylvania-ness. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=273.56s)]
*  There is a standing with and for Pennsylvanians. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=276.6s)]
*  That's me. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=280.68s)]
*  That's who I am. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=281.68s)]
*  That's where I come from. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=282.68s)]
*  And this person here who is running, he is an outsider. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=283.68s)]
*  And he's an outsider, kind of most explicitly and most funny in these viral ads that you've [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=287.68s)]
*  shown because he's from across straight state lines. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=293.76s)]
*  But the underlying thing he's really pointing to is that he is rich, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=297.2s)]
*  He is out of touch. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=302.8s)]
*  He doesn't understand you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=304.8s)]
*  He doesn't understand where you're from. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=306.44s)]
*  He doesn't understand what you want. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=308.6s)]
*  And he doesn't know what it is that this state, Pennsylvania, requires. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=310.52s)]
*  And so it's really a class argument, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  He is drawing a class contrast. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  And he's creating a form of identity, a big collective we among Pennsylvanians and saying, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=322.04s)]
*  if you're going to govern in our name, you need to be one of us. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ljR7vS62dU&t=329.5s)]
