# Early Voting Underway As Democrats Make Final Case To Voters
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc)
*  All right, so these midterms are the first nationwide election since Donald Trump began [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=0.0s)]
*  spreading the big lie following his loss to Joe Biden back in 2020. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=6.32s)]
*  That lie of a stolen election that we all know wasn't stolen fueled the violent insurrection [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  at the Capitol on January the 6th. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=17.42s)]
*  And it is still creating an atmosphere in which the future of democracy is in doubt. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=19.3s)]
*  And the threat of violence and intimidation hangs in the air. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=24.02s)]
*  In January, six riders were explicitly looking for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that day, yelling, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=28.98s)]
*  where's Nancy? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=34.3s)]
*  As they stormed the halls of our Congress. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=35.58s)]
*  Two sources briefed on the violent incident tell NBC News that phrase was uttered by the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=38.72s)]
*  assailant who spoke into Speaker Pelosi's San Francisco home in the middle of the night [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  on Friday and then assaulted her husband, Paul, with a hammer. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=47.74s)]
*  Speaker Pelosi was in D.C. at the time but is now back in San Francisco to be with her [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=52.14s)]
*  husband who is expected to recover after undergoing surgery for his injuries. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=56.18s)]
*  Now, we still don't know for sure what the attacker's motive was, but the San Francisco [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=62.06s)]
*  Police Department said last night, quote, this was not a random act. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=66.42s)]
*  This was intentional. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=71.72s)]
*  Let's bring in our Democratic candidates, Congressman Pat Ryan of New York. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=73.64s)]
*  He is now in the race for New York's 18th District. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=76.7s)]
*  Texas State Representative Jasmine Crockett, who is running in Texas's 30th congressional [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=79.58s)]
*  former New York Congressman Max Rose, who is trying to reclaim his seat right here in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=84.58s)]
*  New York's 11th District and Oregon State Representative Andrea Salinas, the Democratic [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=88.22s)]
*  candidate in Oregon's 6th congressional district. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=92.38s)]
*  It's great to have all four of you with us. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=95.7s)]
*  This is kind of an unprecedented moment to have all four of you on the show. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=97.3s)]
*  So we're very fortunate to have this wide ranging conversation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=101.62s)]
*  Congressman Ryan, I'd like to start with you as a member of the Democratic delegation under [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=104.9s)]
*  Speaker Pelosi. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=108.6s)]
*  I just want to get your reaction to these dangerous developments this week and your [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=110.3s)]
*  reaction to the attack. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=114.06s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  It is heinous and unacceptable. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  And I think it speaks to how toxic our politics have become, that that this political [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=123.06s)]
*  violence would even be on the table whatsoever. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=130.06s)]
*  I mean, I when I signed up to do public service as an army officer, I knew my life would be [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=133.54s)]
*  at risk, but I did not expect as a member of Congress that that would be the case. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=138.98s)]
*  So we have to figure out how to get back to a sense of dignified disagreement where we [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=142.9s)]
*  can we can go back and forth constructively. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=151.06s)]
*  State Representative Crockett, your reaction to the attack on Speaker Pelosi's husband and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=155.3s)]
*  the lack of civility in our current politics. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=160.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's just another another level of hypocrisy that we see coming from the right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=162.98s)]
*  Unfortunately, right now, we know that the right continues to say that they are the party [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=167.78s)]
*  of law and order. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  But every time we see some sort of violence, especially political violence, is actually [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=173.46s)]
*  coming from the right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=178.66000000000003s)]
*  We know what happened on January 6. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=179.94s)]
*  We know that they were not supporting law enforcement on that day. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=181.94s)]
*  We know that they weren't supporting law enforcement when they decided to pass these [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  crazy gun laws that they passed in states like Texas. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  And we know that they have not taken that same hard line stance against violence as [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  relates to Speaker Pelosi and her husband. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  In fact, we saw so many of them just going back on the campaign trail and continuing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=202.74s)]
*  with their rhetoric, their very dangerous rhetoric. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=207.22s)]
*  And so if we really want to get to who really is the party of law and order, I don't think [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  that there's a question about the fact that Democrats are leading the way. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=214.74s)]
*  Former Congressman Rose, let me ask you as you try to reclaim your seat you ran in 2018. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=218.98s)]
*  It seems like a lifetime ago, just in terms of where our politics have evolved from, even [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=226.02s)]
*  though 2018 was very contentious and compared to what we're seeing now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  How has the political rhetoric changed in this country just in the span of the past [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=235.06s)]
*  four years? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=240.26s)]
*  It's only gotten worse. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=240.82s)]
*  And the threat of violence has only gotten worse. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=243.54s)]
*  And a big part of it is the fact that we now doubt, particularly when you look at the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=246.10000000000002s)]
*  extremist right, which side they're going to fall upon when it comes to questions that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  used to be just absolutely normal, like the result of approving the results of an election [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=258.58s)]
*  or being willing to criticize people after they storm the Capitol and force elected [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  officials to literally run for their lives and injure hundreds of police officers. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=270.42s)]
*  What's very scary right now is so many officials and those running for office, it seems that all [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=275.62s)]
*  they care about is winning the next election. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=280.26s)]
*  They don't care about the Constitution. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=282.82s)]
*  They don't care about a democracy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=284.74s)]
*  They certainly often don't care about issues of public safety. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=286.26s)]
*  That to me is not just sad and disgraceful, but it's scary. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=289.46s)]
*  We have to do everything we can to fix it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=293.3s)]
*  State Representative Salinas, how do you keep focused on the needs of your constituents [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=295.7s)]
*  when there is so much dangerous noise as we were just hearing here from former [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=302.34s)]
*  Congressman Rose on the other side of the aisle? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=306.34s)]
*  Yeah, for me, it is really talking to voters about the issues that matter. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=310.42s)]
*  They're done and tired of politicians putting politics first and not people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=314.18s)]
*  And right now, this is what we are seeing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=320.74s)]
*  And Republicans are dangerous. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  This is really extreme when people are being harmed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  My thoughts and prayers go out to Speaker Pelosi and her spouse for a full and speedy recovery. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=329.62s)]
*  But we shouldn't be thinking about this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=335.22s)]
*  We should be thinking about the needs of the constituents that I am trying to serve in this [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  sixth congressional district. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=341.54s)]
*  Our focus should be on affordable housing, on the cost of living that we're facing right now, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  on access to abortion and a climate-friendly future. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=350.82s)]
*  And we can't talk about this because the right has hijacked safety, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=355.46s)]
*  and they are putting at risk people's lives. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=360.73999999999995s)]
*  Congressman Ryan, your voters and your constituents, some of these issues that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=364.26s)]
*  we're dealing with are nationwide. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  Some of them are more localized. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=369.53999999999996s)]
*  What are you hearing from your constituents about [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  what concerns they have as the midterm approaches? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=374.41999999999996s)]
*  I think there are two twin imperatives right now that folks want us to deliver on. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  One, we have to provide economic relief, the cost of everything, gas, groceries, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=384.66s)]
*  housing, health care going up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  We have to continue to deliver, and we have been delivering. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  We have to continue to deliver even more relief, capping and lowering prescription drug prices, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=396.26000000000005s)]
*  cutting the gas tax, and so on and so forth. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=402.18s)]
*  The other piece, though, that can't get lost in this, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=404.82000000000005s)]
*  we have fundamental rights and American freedoms under threat. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=406.98s)]
*  Abortion rights and reproductive freedom ripped away. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  We have to both deliver relief and fight for rights, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=413.86s)]
*  and we shouldn't force any American to choose one or the other. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=417.86s)]
*  We are the party that will deliver and are delivering on both of those. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=421.86s)]
*  State Representative Crockett, you recently said we've got to stop being so conservative [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=426.1s)]
*  in the Democratic Party and actually be more aggressive about going after every single voter. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  Expand on that for us. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=436.42s)]
*  What did you mean by it? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=438.18s)]
*  Yeah, no, absolutely. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=440.1s)]
*  You know, so often we sit there and we wait for the voters to come in, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=441.86s)]
*  and there's a lot of voters that are just tired. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=445.86s)]
*  They're really tired of hearing from politicians on the left and the right. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=448.1s)]
*  They honestly are just trying to figure out who really cares about them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=452.1s)]
*  And sadly, what we see is this fear mongering that's going on. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=456.26s)]
*  We've got the fake fear that's coming from the right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=459.62s)]
*  And honestly, on the left, we really need to talk about the factual fears, right? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=462.26s)]
*  They're making up things like trans children are going to be a problem, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=467.54s)]
*  or that there's a problem with women deciding what they're going to do with their bodies. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=471.06s)]
*  Those are all fake fears. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=475.38s)]
*  But we have factual fears, factual fears over our democracy, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=477.14s)]
*  factual fears over the fact that we have children, specifically in the state of Texas, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=480.9s)]
*  that are sadly enough being raped almost daily, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=486.42s)]
*  yet they will not be able to seek the reproductive health that they need. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=489.22s)]
*  And they will be victimized again in a state like Texas. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=493.14s)]
*  So we've got to push hard and we've got to push back on the Republicans [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=496.58s)]
*  and make sure we tell them that the facts are really on our side. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=501.14s)]
*  Let me play for you a soundbite of former President Barack Obama, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=504.9s)]
*  who I still think is a master communicator, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=509.3s)]
*  one of the greatest communicators in the Democratic Party, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=511.86s)]
*  in all of American politics, to be quite honest. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=514.98s)]
*  Let me play you the soundbite. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=516.5799999999999s)]
*  This was from Milwaukee, in Milwaukee just a few hours ago. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=517.46s)]
*  The fundamental issue you should be asking yourself right now is, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=520.66s)]
*  who will fight for you? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=526.66s)]
*  Who cares about you? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=530.5799999999999s)]
*  That's the choice in this election. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=533.06s)]
*  All the other stuff is surface stuff. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=535.22s)]
*  It's distraction. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=538.9s)]
*  He had a lot of very powerful points throughout the 45 minutes or so he spoke. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=541.54s)]
*  How does what he say on that level translate to voters in your district? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=546.42s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=552.42s)]
*  We're reminded every two years when he hits the campaign trail [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=554.5799999999999s)]
*  about just how much of a master communicator he is. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=557.38s)]
*  And I think more Democrats should be messaging like him. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=560.26s)]
*  No, there is no doubt. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=563.3s)]
*  The president hits the nail on the head. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=566.66s)]
*  But let's take it to the second question and the third question. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=569.3s)]
*  You look just at the extremist Republican Party's votes. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=572.9000000000001s)]
*  It tells you everything you need to know that they are not on the side of the American people. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=576.2600000000001s)]
*  How could you claim that you're for public safety and then vote against universal background checks? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=580.2600000000001s)]
*  How can you claim you're for public safety and then vote against banning assault weapons, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=585.1400000000001s)]
*  a weapon I carried in combat, Pat carried in combat, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=589.62s)]
*  has no place being sold in the United States of America? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=592.34s)]
*  How could you say that you're on the side of the American people when it comes to lowering prices [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=595.5400000000001s)]
*  but defend oil companies when they're price gouging the American consumer? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=600.98s)]
*  And then finally, how could you say that you're a patriot [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=605.38s)]
*  but then when it comes time to actually certify a free and fair election, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=608.34s)]
*  you'd rather suck up to the former president who literally just tried to kill you? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=613.62s)]
*  These folks right now are not fighting for the American people. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=618.34s)]
*  They're actually rooting against the American people [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=622.74s)]
*  because they think that any pain they may feel is potentially to their electoral gain. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=625.22s)]
*  That's the only reason why they never propose any substantive solutions. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=630.02s)]
*  So we want to, we all, all of us candidates are eager to hear President Obama [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=634.18s)]
*  make more of those speeches because he's absolutely correct. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=638.18s)]
*  Yeah, and I think he's got a few more before the midterms. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=640.98s)]
*  State Representative Salinas, you're running in a newly formed district in Oregon. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=644.42s)]
*  Talk about what you're seeing on the ground and the challenges [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=647.9399999999999s)]
*  of trying to reach this new audience. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=652.18s)]
*  Yeah, so thank you. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=656.18s)]
*  The, I mean, what we're seeing on the ground is exactly what President Obama stated, right? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=658.0999999999999s)]
*  People want to know who is fighting for me, who is fighting for me on these economic issues, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=662.9799999999999s)]
*  on gas prices, on grocery prices, on economic freedom. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=667.8599999999999s)]
*  And I include abortion in that economic freedom because if you cannot choose whether and when [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  to get pregnant, you are not free of those economic constraints. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=677.3s)]
*  So I would say, people are asking me that and I'm telling them I've delivered. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=681.14s)]
*  And my opponent is an empty shell who is only for himself. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=686.58s)]
*  He is in this for himself. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=690.5s)]
*  He is not in it for anybody on the ground. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  And voters want to know that their elected officials are going to Washington, D.C. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=695.62s)]
*  to actually represent them. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=699.22s)]
*  And I do believe that, you know, people are not pushing back hard enough. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=701.62s)]
*  And I think, you know, sometimes we're not seeing the press actually ask, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=705.5400000000001s)]
*  what is your plan? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=708.98s)]
*  You know, Mr. Republican candidate, what is your plan to get this done? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=710.0200000000001s)]
*  Because I have a plan and I've been talking to voters directly about what that plan is. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=713.62s)]
*  And they're going to start making sure that they're filling out their [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=718.5s)]
*  ballots and getting those ballots in. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=721.38s)]
*  All right, candidates, please stick around. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=722.74s)]
*  After the break, we're going to continue. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=724.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwvR_GC6dmc&t=743.62s)]
