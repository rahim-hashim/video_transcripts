# Guns Or Butter: Sen. Manchin Continues To Count Pennies In The Wrong Places
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 15, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c)
*  Hey there everyone, we are headed for yet another decisive week in Washington. On Monday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=0.0s)]
*  the White House will host a signing ceremony for the one trillion dollar bipartisan infrastructure [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=4.88s)]
*  bill. President Biden expected to tap the benefits of that legislation that marks the largest federal [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  investment in infrastructure in more than a decade. On Capitol Hill, House Democrats say they will move [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  forward this week with plans to vote on the 1.75 trillion dollar Build Back Better Social Spending [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Bill. And while that number is intimidating, if considered annually, which is what you should be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=26.56s)]
*  doing over 10 years, the cost of that bill would equal just 175 billion dollars per year. Now, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=32.32s)]
*  new polling from the Washington Post actually shows that it remains very popular. Nearly six [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=40.64s)]
*  in 10 Americans express support. Now, given the deeply divided reality of the nation's politics, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=46.56s)]
*  that is an extraordinarily high level of support to have 60 percent on anything these days. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=52.96s)]
*  As we continue to fight a lingering pandemic, the Build Back Better bill includes programs [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  the American people clearly want and that they desperately need, particularly since rising prices [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=63.28s)]
*  are battering the family budget. On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that inflation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=69.76s)]
*  rose 6.2 percent in October compared to a year ago. That's the largest annual increase in about [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  30 years. But what is actually causing this rise? Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the culprit [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=81.92s)]
*  is obvious. The pandemic has been calling the shots for the economy and for inflation. And if [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=88.72s)]
*  we want to get inflation down, I think continuing to make progress against the pandemic is the most [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=97.76s)]
*  important thing we can do. I think it's important to realize that the cause of this inflation is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=105.44s)]
*  the pandemic. All right. So if the pandemic is causing prices to go up, what do we do to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=114.16s)]
*  address that problem? Now, the White House is very clear about this and they say the answer is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=121.2s)]
*  Build Back Better. Listen to Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council on [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=125.2s)]
*  Meet the Press just this morning. We have to address those costs that are the biggest pain [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=129.36s)]
*  points for the American, for American families. Things like housing and health care and child care, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=135.60000000000002s)]
*  that's exactly what the Build Back Better bill that the House is going to consider this week will do. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  All right. So while this may seem clear to most Democrats, some of the so-called moderates in the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=146.0s)]
*  party, they have a different view. Folks like Senator Joe Manchin say rising inflation makes [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=152.08s)]
*  them weary of additional spending or more specifically, let's be clear about this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=157.04s)]
*  It makes them weary of additional social spending. You know, the money actually spent [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  to help the working class families for things like housing and child care and affordable health care. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=168.0s)]
*  But those same politicians express no qualms, none whatsoever, for other spending bills that are far, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  far larger. Just this week, the Senate will focus its attention on the National Defense [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Authorization Act. That's the annual military spending bill. The expected cost for next year, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=186.96s)]
*  around $750 billion. Now, it doesn't take a math whiz to see that these politicians who fret and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=193.36s)]
*  scream over $175 billion on social spending programs with broad bipartisan support are [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=201.68s)]
*  perfectly fine and okay with spending more than four times as much on the military budget. They're [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=208.72s)]
*  uncomfortable spending this kind of money for things like tanks and guns and bullets, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=215.04s)]
*  but not so much on tangible programs like child care that directly affect the daily lives of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=219.84s)]
*  millions of Americans. Did the fiscally cautious Manchin make an appearance on any of the Sunday [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  shows this morning to express his concern over military spending? You know the answer to that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  He did not. So as the week begins, let's remind him and everyone else and the rest of our elected [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=237.44s)]
*  representatives in Washington that the programs in Build Back Better are popular and they are [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=242.72s)]
*  necessary not only to fight inflation, but to actually help put an end to the pandemic as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R81mRVob7c&t=248.16s)]
