# Congresswoman Judy Chu on 'The Right’s New McCarthyism'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw)
*  All right, let's talk about McCarthy for a moment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=0.0s)]
*  No, not Kevin McCarthy, Joseph McCarthy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=7.88s)]
*  In a piece for MSNBC.com, Congresswoman Judy Chu says that she is the target of, quote, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=11.36s)]
*  the right's new McCarthyism, and not just from her Republican colleagues, but also from [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  right-wing media outlets. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=21.8s)]
*  Here's how congressman, Texas congressman, rather, Lance Gooden, spoke about Congresswoman [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=24.04s)]
*  Chu just last month. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=28.52s)]
*  I think everyone that's standing up for Chinese communist parties should be looked into. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=31.8s)]
*  Yes, I question her either loyalty or competence. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=36.32s)]
*  And I'm really disappointed and shocked that someone like Judy Chu would have a security [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=39.56s)]
*  clearance and be entitled to confidential intelligence briefings. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=43.6s)]
*  Loyalty. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=48.68s)]
*  Now, what could Congresswoman Chu have done to lose Lance Gooden's trust? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=49.68s)]
*  She voted against creating a committee to investigate U.S.-China competition, which [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=56.68s)]
*  she feared would intensify anti-Asian hate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=60.94s)]
*  For the record, 65 of her Democratic colleagues also voted against that panel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=64.8s)]
*  She also defended Dominic Ing, who President Biden appointed to lead U.S. trade interests [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=70.88s)]
*  in Asia against racist attacks from the right. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=75.2s)]
*  So Lance Gooden believes Congresswoman Chu must be disloyal to the U.S. because she denounces [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=79.4s)]
*  anti-Asian hate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=85.92s)]
*  Never mind that Gooden supported overturning the 2020 presidential election results, an [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=88.52s)]
*  actual act of disloyalty to our country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=93.6s)]
*  Congresswoman Chu says it best. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=98.2s)]
*  The right's ugly and false accusations build on the centuries-long stereotype that Chinese [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=99.58s)]
*  Americans and Asian Americans, more broadly, are forever foreigners in their own land. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=104.86s)]
*  Democratic congressman Judy Chu of California joins me now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for coming back on the show. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=113.56s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  We have a lot to talk about in terms of what we originally wanted to talk to you about, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=117.6s)]
*  which is that segment I just outlined. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  But I do want to get your reaction to Donald Trump's social media post this morning. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=123.24s)]
*  What do you make of this development? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=128.14s)]
*  I think that he is trying to incentivize the right to be even more sympathetic to him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=133.44s)]
*  The fact that he would actually announce the arrest himself makes me wonder if he is trying [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=142.46s)]
*  to do something similar to a January 6 move, which is to get his supporters to be even [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  more fervent in their support. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=157.78s)]
*  And who knows what they would do. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=160.5s)]
*  Let me get to your piece that you wrote on MSNBC.com. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=162.78s)]
*  You write, in part, this newfangled McCarthyism combines Red Scare tactics, racism and xenophobia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=166.42s)]
*  The allegations, which won't stop with Aang and me, are downright dangerous. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  How dangerous are these attacks for you personally and the AAPI community? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, I feel that Lance Gooden put a target on my back by saying that I was disloyal and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  should be investigated as a spy for China. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=195.34s)]
*  And it is outrageous. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=198.86s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  It's downright racist because it is based on this forever foreigner stereotype that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=201.78s)]
*  Chinese Americans and Asian Americans have faced for decades. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=207.02s)]
*  But it is dangerous overall. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=212.26000000000002s)]
*  And it comes on the heel of three years of anti-Asian hate when President Trump called [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  the COVID-19 virus China virus. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=220.86s)]
*  We've had 11,500 anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=224.7s)]
*  And who knows where these accusations of being spies for China could lead. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=229.54s)]
*  It only fans the flames of xenophobia. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=235.66s)]
*  Yeah, and it seems like it's become more of the mainstream Republican Party. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=238.94s)]
*  I mean, the GOP in recent years has been more focused on these sorts of culture wars and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  racist rhetoric rather than solving issues for the American people. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=248.1s)]
*  This racist rhetoric, I would argue, plays into the GOP's main work as a whole, no? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=252.86s)]
*  Well, I think that they are dividing society and they are playing their culture wars. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=261.94s)]
*  That is clear in terms of what they're doing with the China Select Committee. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=271.22s)]
*  That's why I did vote against the China Select Committee. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=277.02000000000004s)]
*  I thought that it could increase xenophobia. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=280.1s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=282.94s)]
*  It did because it was a signal to people like Lance Gooden that they could accuse me and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=284.42s)]
*  Dominic Ng of being spies for China. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=291.1s)]
*  And actually, they're not stopping there. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=294.14s)]
*  The numbers that they're pointing out are increasing every day, including the latest [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  ones being the former mayor of our local city and the former president of an esteemed [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=301.94s)]
*  community group, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  So they are pointing fingers. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=311.74s)]
*  It's downright scapegoating. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=314.02s)]
*  And what is really disturbing is that history could repeat itself, because let us not forget [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=316.86s)]
*  that when Japanese Americans were incarcerated, it did not happen overnight. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=322.42s)]
*  They first started going after the leaders and used that to isolate them. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=327.94s)]
*  Several months later, Japanese Americans lost everything that they had in the camps. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=335.06s)]
*  And it was based on an accusation of espionage by Japanese Americans, though not a single [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  case was ever found. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=346.5s)]
*  I am so glad you bring up that point, because the tropes of dual loyalty and disloyalty, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=348.46s)]
*  I think, are rampant right now. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=354.29999999999995s)]
*  And we need to fight them every chance we get. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=356.38s)]
*  Let me ask you about something that hits close to home to your district. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  And that is this executive order President Biden signed this week. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=363.5s)]
*  It is designed to increase background checks. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=367.62s)]
*  He signed it while visiting Monterey Park, California. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=370.14s)]
*  As I mentioned, 11 people were killed in a mass shooting there back in January. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=373.14s)]
*  Monterey Park is part of your district. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=377.82s)]
*  How important is this executive order? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=380.38s)]
*  And what did it mean to you that Biden signed it while visiting your district? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=382.5s)]
*  Well, I was so gratified that he came to the district. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=388.22s)]
*  We still have a hole that's gone through our hearts because of the shooting and the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=393.41999999999996s)]
*  community had yet to heal. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=400.26s)]
*  So for the leader of the nation to come and console the families of the 11 who were [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=402.29999999999995s)]
*  killed, as well as the nine who were wounded, and to console the whole community, which [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=409.78s)]
*  is still traumatized, was very, very meaningful. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=415.26s)]
*  He reflected on his own experiences and the the victims families really appreciated it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=419.26000000000005s)]
*  And the fact that he had this executive order on gun safety was also very, very [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=427.58000000000004s)]
*  significant. For instance, this shooter may have been caught with a red flag law. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=435.66s)]
*  That is, he was mentally deteriorating and he was accumulating ammunition. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=445.02s)]
*  Surely somebody in a circle knew about it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=448.5s)]
*  But I'm not sure that people in the immigrant community know that a red flag law even [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=450.78s)]
*  exists. So in his executive order, he is going for enhanced outreach to communities for [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=456.9s)]
*  that. And also he is he is pointing to the fact that FEMA will go into a community when [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=465.09999999999997s)]
*  there's a natural disaster and coordinate resources. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=473.94s)]
*  But there isn't such a thing for mass shootings. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=477.34s)]
*  And yet the community is in utter chaos. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=481.42s)]
*  There has to be greater coordination of all the resources that are available. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=484.62s)]
*  And that's what he is he is saying in this executive order should be done. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=488.74s)]
*  Congressman Judy Shue, thank you so much. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=493.54s)]
*  I greatly appreciate your time, as always. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=495.26s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_UfFa9ZGIw&t=498.65999999999997s)]
