# Republican loyalty to Trump veers into “authoritarian bargain”
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI)
*  Donald Trump's second indictment has reinforced Republican devotion to the twice-impeached [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=0.0s)]
*  and now twice-indicted ex-president, because that's what always happens when Trump finds [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=7.62s)]
*  himself in trouble, the opposite of what would happen for a normal politician, let alone [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=13.14s)]
*  a normal person. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=18.1s)]
*  Just like the Access Hollywood tape, the first impeachment, the January 6th insurrection, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=19.86s)]
*  the second impeachment, and the earlier indictment, Trump's second indictment, all were bound [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=24.14s)]
*  to bring the GOP even closer to him. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=29.98s)]
*  And as MSNBC columnist and author Ruth Ben-Giott laid out for us on our network's indictment [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=32.88s)]
*  special, for Republicans, this unending loyalty isn't some lucky fluke for Trump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  It's a derangement syndrome that has infected the GOP called the authoritarian bargain. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=43.86s)]
*  This is consistent with an authoritarian party that's enthralled to a cult leader. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=50.86s)]
*  And there's something called an authoritarian bargain, and that is when a leader like Trump, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  who demands loyalty and is highly corrupt, gets political elites to sign on to support [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=62.66s)]
*  him. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=69.02s)]
*  And once they do that, they stick with him no matter what happens. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=70.02s)]
*  I'm telling you, no matter what happens. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=74.3s)]
*  Even Trump's presidential rivals, who should want him out of the race, well, they're actually [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=77.58s)]
*  jumping on that Trump bandwagon. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=82.42s)]
*  Ron DeSantis called the indictment the, quote, weaponization of government. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=84.7s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy is urging every presidential candidate to pardon Trump if elected, even [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=89.1s)]
*  before the trial has begun. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=94.22s)]
*  Nikki Haley embraced the idea of a pardon. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=95.66s)]
*  And Miami mayor Francis Suarez, who's, I guess, painting himself as a moderate in this presidential [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=98.06s)]
*  field, well, he also vowed to pardon Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=103.5s)]
*  And these GOP candidates are at the top of a pyramid of authoritarian bargainers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  The day of Trump's arraignment, House Republican leaders, including Speaker Kevin McCarthy, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=112.66s)]
*  reiterated their support for Trump, calling the arraignment a, quote, dark day for our [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=116.98s)]
*  country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=121.34s)]
*  For McCarthy, he is just doubling down on the man who he embraced only weeks after the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=122.34s)]
*  insurrection because, for these people, they still see political value in being tied to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=127.06s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=133.9s)]
*  As Ruth explains on her substack, Lucid, the root of this bargain derives from the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=135.22s)]
*  desire for power and the need to continually have more of it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=139.98s)]
*  It's, quote, the thrill of partnering with an amoral individual for whom there are no [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=145.46s)]
*  limits or restraints. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=149.94s)]
*  So now let's shift to the consequences of that authoritarian bargain, because defending [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=152.34s)]
*  a twice-impeached, twice-indicted ex-president has some cost. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=156.74s)]
*  In this case, the cost is grave damage to the American justice system, because in order [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=162.7s)]
*  to defend Trump's actions, like so many Republicans are doing now, you have to delegitimize the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=167.42s)]
*  entire Justice Department. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=173.26s)]
*  You have to attack the entire legal system. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=176.18s)]
*  Those attacks trickle down to the public and can have even further consequences, like what [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=178.94s)]
*  we saw on January 6, 2021. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=184.38s)]
*  If you attack the American electoral system enough, you delegitimize it, you sow doubt [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=187.46s)]
*  and distrust and anger, and then the people can act. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=192.86s)]
*  To take from Ruth, quote, each lawless action by Trump has made the GOP more, not less, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=198.38s)]
*  faithful to him in saving him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=204.38s)]
*  They think they are saving themselves. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=206.62s)]
*  Now, experts on extremism have raised alarms about the potential for violence in the wake [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=209.18s)]
*  of this second indictment, even if it didn't manifest in Miami during Trump's arraignment. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=213.44s)]
*  And it doesn't have to be as massive as an insurrection to still be damaging. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=218.72s)]
*  Donald Trump might be the one on trial, but those who support, those who embrace, those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=224.04s)]
*  who continue to enable him are doing just as much damage to our institutions and system. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=228.0s)]
*  These Republicans are so addicted to power, even when it is connected to a weak, strong [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=235.16s)]
*  man who gets politically weaker with each indictment that they won't stop helping and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=240.2s)]
*  enabling Donald Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=245.16s)]
*  And sadly, at this point, they probably can't. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=246.48s)]
*  And that leaves the rest of us to suffer the consequences. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=250.56s)]
*  Joining me now are Ruth Ben-Ghia, New York University history professor and author of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=254.0s)]
*  Strongmen, Mussolini to the President. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=257.28s)]
*  She's also an MSNBC columnist. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=259.24s)]
*  Jordan Rubin, MSNBC blog writer and a former Manhattan prosecutor. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=261.8s)]
*  And Barbara McQuade, MSNBC legal analyst and University of Michigan law professor. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=266.08s)]
*  It's great to have all three of you with us. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=270.0s)]
*  So, Ruth, this is something that you and I have talked about many times in the past, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=271.8s)]
*  but lay it out for me. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  Is there something that we are missing here? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  What has struck you the most concerning this aspect of, you know, this authoritarian bargain [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=279.08s)]
*  that has now been made with Trump, as you described? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=285.64s)]
*  What strikes me the most is that they are in thrall to this cult leader and that he's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=291.2s)]
*  been able to subject the party to a kind of authoritarian discipline where it's all about [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=296.76s)]
*  loyalty. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  And the other thing that strikes me is you and I, Eamon, talk about Middle Eastern and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=304.24s)]
*  other dictators. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=309.28s)]
*  If you have any subordination in those contexts, you go to jail or you're killed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=310.48s)]
*  Here, these people are willingly being complicit with the attempt to destroy our justice system [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=316.48s)]
*  and our democracy, and they're not going to be killed or jailed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=322.16s)]
*  They would maybe lose their political career, like Jeff Sessions, when he refused to perjure [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  himself for Trump as attorney general. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=332.8s)]
*  So that's a very sad commentary on the level of cowardice and the level of opportunism [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=335.6s)]
*  among the GOP. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=341.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=342.48s)]
*  We talked about the threat of fear in those countries, like in the Middle East, is always [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=343.48s)]
*  that if you fall out of favor with the ruler, you find yourself either dead or in prison. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=346.92s)]
*  I don't know what's compelling the Republicans to do that here. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  And you've written, Ruth, on your sub stack that GOP lawmakers who engage in public displays [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  of fealty know that opposing him could mean the end of their political careers. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  Is it safe to say that a large swath of the GOP today puts power over a country and that's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=364.68s)]
*  what's compelling them? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=370.44s)]
*  They simply just don't want to lose power or the access to power that comes with these [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=371.44s)]
*  positions through Donald Trump? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=376.4s)]
*  It's a combination of power. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=379.52s)]
*  It's also there's fear involved, fear of having their secrets, whatever they are, revealed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=381.12s)]
*  Donald Trump is a decades old blackmaker, blackmailer, expert in what the Russians call [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=388.28s)]
*  And so there's that kind of fear as well as opportunism and this idea that that's very [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=396.64s)]
*  compelling that you could have as much power as possible. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=406.24s)]
*  And then for the fanatics like Jim Jordan and Ron DeSantis, they do buy into this idea [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=409.26s)]
*  of an authoritarian vision of power, which is limitless. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=414.52s)]
*  It's a fantasy, but it's very compelling in those who have that temperament. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  Barbara, talk us through how the rhetoric and the danger of that rhetoric can actually [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=424.24s)]
*  undermine our confidence in the system. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=430.76s)]
*  I mean, we now have, and I guess you could look at the elections as the best example. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=433.04s)]
*  When you've had the systematic targeting of our electoral system, claiming fraud when [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=438.64s)]
*  there was no fraud, claiming rigged election when there was no evidence of it being rigged, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=443.36s)]
*  you end up with a January 6th type of insurrection where somebody feels it is okay to use violence. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=448.1s)]
*  To stop and overturn our democratic system. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  But explain how that would work for our justice system as well. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think many of us hear this rhetoric and we sort of roll our eyes and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  shrug our shoulders and say, how can anybody believe this stuff? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=465.0s)]
*  But we see very real consequences of all of it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=467.72s)]
*  One is the harm to democracy. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=470.6s)]
*  There are states that have passed laws under the guise of preventing election fraud that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=472.0s)]
*  have made it harder to vote. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=477.16s)]
*  We have seen this now in people who are very skeptical about the charges that have been [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=480.28s)]
*  filed against Donald Trump, that somehow, you know, Jack Smith is what was the word [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=484.12s)]
*  lunatic and a thug and that the Justice Department is being weaponized against the right. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=489.28s)]
*  And this does have a consequence. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=496.32s)]
*  You know, we saw during the Trump administration, there was the man known as the mega bomber, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=497.52s)]
*  Cesar Sayoc, who was a great supporter of Donald Trump and went after his enemies, including [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=501.64s)]
*  democratic politicians and members of the media. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=507.0s)]
*  After the Mar-a-Lago search, when Donald Trump spoke out against the FBI, claiming that what [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=511.2s)]
*  they had done was lawless, when in fact they had a court authorized search warrant, we [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=516.04s)]
*  saw a man in Cincinnati take action. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=520.6s)]
*  He tried to breach the Cincinnati field office of the FBI and ended up killed in a standoff. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=523.52s)]
*  And I also worry about just the erosion of trust in those institutions. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=529.44s)]
*  You know, the FBI knocks on doors every day looking for information and tips on everything [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=533.8800000000001s)]
*  from kidnapping to human trafficking to bank robberies. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  And if they are told again and again that they are corrupt, people in the public are [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=542.12s)]
*  going to slam the door instead of opening it and helping them. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=546.72s)]
*  When we're asking members of juries to believe the testimony of FBI agents at trial, I worry [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=549.48s)]
*  that their testimony will not be believed when they hear again and again how corrupt. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the cornerstone of our system is based on confidence in that system. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=559.44s)]
*  And if it's eroded, as you said, Barbara, we begin to lose faith in it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=563.6s)]
*  Jordan, politically speaking, New York Attorney General Letitia James said this week that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=567.36s)]
*  she's received death threats on her life for investigating Donald Trump. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=571.5200000000001s)]
*  These attempts to delegitimize the justice system, as Barbara laid out, they undermine [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=577.72s)]
*  the entire process, but they also have real-life consequences for the people who serve in these [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=583.36s)]
*  positions of accountability and governance. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=593.12s)]
*  We've seen that across nearly all of these cases, including the state pending criminal [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=594.12s)]
*  prosecution coming out of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, my former office. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=598.12s)]
*  But one good thing about all of this is that once you actually get into court, you have [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=602.6s)]
*  to deal with the actual truth of the allegations. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=607.64s)]
*  And all this stuff that's happening outside of the court, it's still important. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't completely fall to the wayside, but when you have someone like Trump, who [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  is stirring all this up outside of the court, having to actually be confronted with the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=619.6s)]
*  facts that are alleged can be an incredibly powerful thing and to some degree an antidote [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=623.92s)]
*  to some of the concerns that we're all rightfully worried about going on outside of the courtroom. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=630.04s)]
*  Ruth, there's a lot of gaslighting in this Trump world from Trump allies. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=635.36s)]
*  We've got representatives Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene leading a recent panel discussion [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=641.56s)]
*  about the insurrection and downplaying the violence of January 6. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=646.0s)]
*  How does that play into the authoritarian bargain concept? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=650.36s)]
*  Yeah, this is something that's very concerning, this attempt to make January 6 into a patriotic [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=656.12s)]
*  act and or have people forget about January 6. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=663.96s)]
*  That's ultimately what they would like, because forgetting about a coup attempt makes it more [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=668.88s)]
*  likely that another authoritarian action could be taken. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=673.68s)]
*  And these kind of proclamations, this is part of their loyalty displays that they're required [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=678.08s)]
*  to do. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=684.2s)]
*  There's the talking point that helps Trump about, and he's going around Waco, Texas and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=685.2s)]
*  other places. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=690.84s)]
*  I did this for you, you know, this was a patriotic thing to save your freedom. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  And they all are required to kind of, you know, circulate those talking points. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=699.84s)]
*  So this, every time we see one of them out there, they may be fanatics who believe this [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=704.72s)]
*  too, but the cult of Trump requires that his version of reality be continually reinforced [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  every day. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=719.24s)]
*  Let's talk about some of the specifics of this documents case, Barbara, and it's important [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=721.08s)]
*  to keep having this conversation. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=724.76s)]
*  I know sometimes it sounds like we're a broken record, but as long as the right and Trump [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=725.96s)]
*  keep exploiting it, I feel like it is our duty to keep talking about it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=729.96s)]
*  You've corrected the record on Trump's comparing his case to the Bill Clinton's socks case [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=734.08s)]
*  or others. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=739.0400000000001s)]
*  Clinton's personal tapes, which he kept in his sock drawer, qualified as his personal [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=740.0400000000001s)]
*  diaries, whereas Trump hoarding sensitive national security information, possible attack [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=744.9200000000001s)]
*  plans and counterattack plans. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=749.96s)]
*  That is not his personal property. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=753.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they couldn't be more different. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=754.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, the Presidential Records Act passed after Watergate defines what is a presidential [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=757.4000000000001s)]
*  record. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=762.32s)]
*  And it says some things are presidential records, which are documents created by the president [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=763.32s)]
*  or for the president for the use in his official duties. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=766.96s)]
*  And then it excludes some other things. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  It talks about personal records like diaries and journals and a court in a Freedom of Information [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  Act case against Bill Clinton ruled that his recorded interviews were diaries or journals [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=777.76s)]
*  not subject to the Presidential Records Act. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=784.0s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump is not even charged under the Presidential Records Act. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=786.52s)]
*  That's a civil law. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=790.56s)]
*  He is charged under the Espionage Act, which makes it a crime to retain willfully national [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=791.56s)]
*  defense information. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=798.04s)]
*  What he took are agency records. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=799.58s)]
*  They are neither presidential records nor personal records. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=801.68s)]
*  They belong to the CIA, the NSA, the Department of Defense. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=805.4s)]
*  They pertain to nuclear programs, to military and weapons capabilities of the United States [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=808.0s)]
*  and our allies, all kinds of military secrets. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=812.76s)]
*  So for about three different reasons, the Bill Clinton case is just absolutely not applicable [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=816.14s)]
*  here. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=822.04s)]
*  But I think it sounds clever. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=823.04s)]
*  He talks about Bill Clinton's socks are up your door, and people don't pay attention [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=824.04s)]
*  to the details, and they nod along and say they're being held to double standards. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=827.28s)]
*  They're completely different cases. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=832.48s)]
*  And so Donald Trump is being treated the way other government employees are treated, who [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=834.4s)]
*  willfully retain national defense information. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=838.9200000000001s)]
*  And perhaps, Jordan, more contemporary wise, can you debunk for us the GOP comparisons [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=841.58s)]
*  to both the Biden and the Pence cases? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=847.54s)]
*  I mean, in those instances, both men opened their doors to investigators and actually [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  cooperated with the investigations. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=854.24s)]
*  And I think it's important to remind our viewers that of all the documents Donald Trump took [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=856.12s)]
*  he's only charged over, I believe, the 30 or so documents that he did not give back. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=861.5999999999999s)]
*  The others that he actually gave back before the raid at Mar-a-Lago, he was not charged [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=866.52s)]
*  for those. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=872.64s)]
*  So he could have possibly never been charged had he just given over all of the documents [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=873.64s)]
*  to the FBI. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=882.56s)]
*  I had a piece that was headlined not long ago that was titled, It's the Obstruction, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=883.56s)]
*  Stupid. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=888.0799999999999s)]
*  And if Donald Trump had gotten that simple memo, we might not even be in this place, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=889.24s)]
*  even if he should have been charged with some of the underlying crimes. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=893.96s)]
*  Now, we could do a whole hour segment on the differences between all of these cases. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=896.6s)]
*  But one thing that we know for sure is based on past Justice Department practice, whether [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=900.84s)]
*  it's the Hillary situation, whether it's Mike Pence just not being charged. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=906.76s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen with Joe Biden yet, but it doesn't seem like he's [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=911.26s)]
*  going to be charged. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=914.0s)]
*  We'll revisit that if he is. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=915.0s)]
*  But really, it comes down to, look, sometimes politicians have had records that they shouldn't [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=917.8s)]
*  have. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=922.56s)]
*  But what you see with Pence and what it looks like with Biden is they cooperate with the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=923.56s)]
*  government. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=927.0s)]
*  They give them back. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=928.0s)]
*  And so even if the underlying conduct seems like it's criminal and Donald Trump's underlying [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=929.0s)]
*  conduct is way more severe than what we know about the Pence and Biden situations, for [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=933.84s)]
*  example, even then, had Donald Trump just cooperated, we might not even be having this [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=938.28s)]
*  conversation. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=943.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  And the chances of him doing that were slim to none. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerEkDP28ZI&t=945.3199999999999s)]
