Within minutes of this decision, a federal judge in Washington issued a ruling in a separate case stating that the pill should remain available. Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California talks to MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin about these contradicting rulings and the real-world impact.

# Congresswoman Lee calls abortion pill ruling 'the most dangerous decision since Roe'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c)
*  federal judges in two different states have issued contradictory decisions that could [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=0.0s)]
*  drastically impact access to a drug used in nearly all medication abortions here in the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=8.8s)]
*  United States. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=14.64s)]
*  A in Texas, Trump appointed U.S. District Judge Matthew Kazmerek ruled to pause FDA [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=15.64s)]
*  approval of the abortion pill in the Pepperstone for one week. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=21.84s)]
*  The Biden administration has already appealed that ruling. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=25.72s)]
*  Within minutes of the Texas decision, Obama appointee U.S. District Judge Thomas Rice [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=29.36s)]
*  issued a ruling in a separate case in Washington state that blocks the FDA from suspending FDA [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=34.12s)]
*  approval of the drug. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=41.24s)]
*  Rice said his ruling only applied to the 17 states and the District of Columbia, whose [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=43.2s)]
*  Democratic Attorneys General sued to protect access to Mefeperstone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Joining me now is Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=53.16s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=55.4s)]
*  Thank you for coming back on the show. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=56.82s)]
*  This is an issue that is, as we've discussed many times on the show with you, extremely [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=59.36s)]
*  personal to you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=63.58s)]
*  In 2021, you shared your story of getting an abortion in Mexico after you found out [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=64.76s)]
*  you were pregnant at 16 years old. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=68.48s)]
*  How crucial is it that minors have access to this care in this country? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=71.74s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=78.88s)]
*  I'm glad to be with you again. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=79.88s)]
*  It is very crucial that everyone have access to medication abortion, Mefeperstone. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=81.16s)]
*  Let me just say this is another court ruling, a radical court ruling, by a judge from Amarillo, Texas. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=88.68s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=96.84s)]
*  And without getting into all of the legal aspects of this, I want to make sure that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=98.2s)]
*  everyone knows that medication abortion is legal still and it's available. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=103.2s)]
*  But we have to really understand that this decision is just another sinister move to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=109.28s)]
*  try to get to the place where this country will enact a national abortion ban. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=115.12s)]
*  It's the most dangerous decision since Roe and we all have to fight back. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=122.4s)]
*  We know that Mefeperstone is just one of two pills used in tandem to induce an abortion. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=127.4s)]
*  Using just one abortion pill instead of two brings down efficacy and it could worsen side [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  effects. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  And we're seeing a judge's ruling infringe on basic common sense health care here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=145.04s)]
*  And the American Medical Association issued a very clear decision and opinion about the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=146.04s)]
*  dangers in this decision. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=152.92s)]
*  This medication abortion, Mefeperstone, is also used for miscarriage management. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=157.44s)]
*  It's used for a variety of medical issues. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=163.32s)]
*  And let me just also say this sets a terrible precedent. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=166.48s)]
*  I mean, FDA approves the safety and efficacy of our medication. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=170.76s)]
*  Can you imagine now the chilling effect and the types of precedent this sets for other [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=177.2s)]
*  types of medicines that you may have in your medicine cabinet for other types of medical [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=183.6s)]
*  issues? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  And so this is very dangerous, not only because it's dangerous in terms of our right to our [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  reproductive justice and freedom, but it's very dangerous because it puts us on a slippery [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=195.24s)]
*  slope where FDA will be undermined and not able to ensure the safety and efficacy of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  other drugs. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=208.44s)]
*  So this is very serious and we can't let this go down like this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=209.44s)]
*  And so we are fighting back as co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus with Congresswoman Diana [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=213.0s)]
*  DeGette. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  We've got a plan and we're working very hard to make sure that we push back on this in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  many ways. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=223.24s)]
*  And I want to reiterate, it's still legal and it's still safe and it's available throughout [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=224.24s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=230.4s)]
*  Let me ask you about the situation we find ourselves in in terms of how to fight back [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=231.4s)]
*  as you are saying right now with these conflicting rulings out of Texas and Washington. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=235.52s)]
*  It's really put abortion providers in limbo and some clinics have vowed to continue prescribing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=241.24s)]
*  the pepper stone even if Judge Kaczmarek's ruling remains in place after this week. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=246.28s)]
*  Your colleague, Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has said that the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=252.32s)]
*  Biden administration should also ignore this ruling. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=256.04s)]
*  And I wanted to get your thoughts on that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=259.32s)]
*  What do you make of that call? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=261.28s)]
*  Well, the Biden administration, the president issued, I think, a very strong statement about [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=262.76s)]
*  what, first of all, what he intends to do in terms of this appeal. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=269.44s)]
*  And secondly, why we have to understand that this is another step toward a national abortion [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=273.92s)]
*  ban. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=280.96s)]
*  I also have to say that he, and I think this is very correct, that we have to remember [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  this is a political aspect of this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  The American public wants the availability of the reproductive choices, reproductive [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=287.76s)]
*  freedom, reproductive justice, to be able to make one's own decision about their health [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=296.28s)]
*  care. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  And so the president in his statement talked about the political aspects. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  The public wants to make sure that people have that right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=308.8s)]
*  And what is taking place is those rights are being taken away now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=313.52s)]
*  So I think that's what we have to really focus on and make sure that we engage in elections [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=316.56s)]
*  so that we can elect at all levels people who care about people's ability to make their [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=321.12s)]
*  own health care decisions about their own bodies. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  What concerns do you have that Republicans will come after other basic health care medications [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=331.0s)]
*  such as birth control next? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=337.48s)]
*  And how are you and your Democratic colleagues working to avoid what happened with Roe v. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=338.48s)]
*  Wade or with abortion by fighting back against these attacks on other potential rights at [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  this moment by Republicans? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  And there are many challenges that are coming up. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned contraception or birth control pills. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  We see them beginning to move on that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=359.44s)]
*  And so we have a series of bills in the House. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=362.72s)]
*  Of course, you know, we're in the minority, but that doesn't mean we're not going to keep [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=366.0s)]
*  fighting. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=368.76s)]
*  But we have legislation to deal with all of the travel issues, you know, all of the issues [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=369.76s)]
*  around the FDA and many, many issues that really the Republicans are trying to move [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  forward to pass. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  But we're going to do everything we can do to stop them because public sentiment in this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  instance is and the public does not want Republicans to go after people's own personal decisions [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=387.12s)]
*  about their health care. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=395.0s)]
*  So this is part of what we do as members of Congress is organized with our outside partners, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=396.48s)]
*  which the activists and our outside groups are doing a phenomenal job with our pro-choice [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  caucus, our Democratic caucus, to make sure that we fight back and to make sure that the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=405.92s)]
*  public's voices are heard in a way that come election time, we know who to vote for and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=410.56s)]
*  not to vote for who's on our side and who's not on our side. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=416.88s)]
*  The public is with us in this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  Congressman Barbara Lee, it's always a pleasure. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=421.92s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=423.68s)]
*  This evening, I greatly appreciate it as always. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUdAWRKe1c&t=424.8s)]
