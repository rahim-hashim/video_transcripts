Video Description: More than a month after the midterms, it’s still not clear who will control Pennsylvania’s state legislature. Democrats won a majority of the seats, but after one lawmaker passed away and two others resigned to take other roles in government, Republicans are claiming they now have a mandate to control the chamber. PA State Representative Joanna McClinton spoke to MSNBC’s Michael Steele about this mess and Democrats’ next move in the commonwealth.

# Who Controls The PA State Legislature?
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU)
*  So, who will control the Pennsylvania state legislature next year? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=0.0s)]
*  That seems like a fairly simple question. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=11.6s)]
*  But somehow, more than a month after the midterms, there isn't a clear answer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=14.32s)]
*  Here's the predicament that I'm going to need you all to follow me closely here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=19.56s)]
*  Democrats won a majority of seats in the statehouse for the first time in a dozen years, but the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=24.04s)]
*  margin was razor thin, 102 to 101, decided by fewer than 65 votes in a race in the Philadelphia [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=28.62s)]
*  suburbs. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=36.94s)]
*  And it turned out to be even more tenuous, because one of the victorious Democrats was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=38.06s)]
*  dead, and he died too late in the election cycle to have his name removed from the ballot. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  What's more, two Democrats who won their statehouse races, but who, at the same time, won seats [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=49.46s)]
*  to higher office, have since resigned, further complicating matters. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=55.62s)]
*  And Republicans, of course, are seizing on those complications, arguing that Democrats [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  lack a mandate to control the statehouse and filing a lawsuit to block the trio's special [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=66.6s)]
*  elections that would all but certainly reconfirm Democratic control of the chamber. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=72.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a mess. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=78.1s)]
*  And it's indicative of Republicans' new strategy, using arcane and sometimes unfair rules to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=80.38s)]
*  seize power. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=86.22s)]
*  Joining me now is Pennsylvania State Representative and House Democratic Leader Joanna McClinton. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=88.02s)]
*  I should note that Representative McClinton has been sworn in as House Majority Leader, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=93.34s)]
*  despite all the chaos. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=98.58s)]
*  Representative, welcome. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=101.22s)]
*  So here's the deal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  Who currently controls the Pennsylvania statehouse? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=106.1s)]
*  As they say in Hollywood, stay tuned to be determined. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=109.58s)]
*  So you laid it out clearly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=115.06s)]
*  You know, voters here in Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, November the 8th, they decided in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=117.86s)]
*  102 districts that Democrats should take their voices, their values and their agenda items [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  to the state Capitol. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=128.66s)]
*  But, of course, we have some precarious circumstances. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=129.66s)]
*  Oh, you are so kind, precarious. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=132.7s)]
*  So what's your path forward here? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=138.06s)]
*  I mean, seriously, it is a mess. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=139.46s)]
*  Republicans are looking to take advantage of the complications in the mess. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=142.46s)]
*  How do you see this playing out? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=147.54s)]
*  So the first thing I want everyone to know is I started last week with a meeting with [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=150.18s)]
*  the Republican leader with the hopes that we could start this razor thin majority new [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=155.38s)]
*  session in January with power sharing agreements, with ways that we can work together on the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=160.96s)]
*  rules, because we don't want to keep bills and committees. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=166.3s)]
*  We want to work together. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=169.46s)]
*  We are very cognizant of our reality, even with a one seat majority. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=170.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, we weren't able to negotiate an agreement, so we had to move really quickly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=175.94s)]
*  And moving quickly for me meant there was a vacancy and it had to be a writ of special [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  election issued. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=186.3s)]
*  But that can only happen once someone is sworn in to be the acting interim officer. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=187.5s)]
*  So I got sworn in and because my caucus won in 102 districts, I was the acting interim [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=193.26s)]
*  presiding officer. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=199.38s)]
*  So I am hopeful that as the court decides there's going to be the first meeting in the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=201.0s)]
*  court of the Commonwealth Court in Pennsylvania next Wednesday, I am hopeful that they will [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=205.7s)]
*  say go ahead and hold all the elections on February the 7th so that voters can make sure [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=209.94s)]
*  that their voices are heard and we can have a full compliment in Harrisburg sooner than [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=215.1s)]
*  later. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=219.7s)]
*  So I want to get your take on my analysis of how Republicans and Democrats approach [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=220.82s)]
*  moments like this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=228.92s)]
*  Where Democrats are in the minority, they often ask, how do we convince the majority [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=231.42s)]
*  to pass X? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  When Republicans are in the minority, they ask, how do we use the rules of the majority [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=240.01999999999998s)]
*  against the majority? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=246.89999999999998s)]
*  How do you see this moment? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=249.26s)]
*  Is this a moment where you have, whether you're in the minority or the majority, a chance [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=250.94s)]
*  to politically engage in a way that you make the rules work for you and you take advantage [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=257.86s)]
*  of the opportunity and push back on the silliness that, oh, you don't have a mandate when the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=264.56s)]
*  seats are that close. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=272.08s)]
*  That still doesn't address the fact that you have more seats. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=274.7s)]
*  How do you see that? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=279.38s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=280.38s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=281.38s)]
*  I mean, we have been told clearly when I started in the House, right, there were 121 Republicans [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=282.38s)]
*  and 82 Democrats. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=288.9s)]
*  So at that time, they could say they had a mandate from voters with a certain agenda. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=290.26s)]
*  We're not able to say that we have a mandate except to say they rejected their extremism, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=294.9s)]
*  their election denialism that they demonstrated since 2020. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=301.1s)]
*  That was rejected. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=305.66s)]
*  And yes, it was only 65 votes in the last race. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=306.66s)]
*  So we've got to be grownups here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=309.94s)]
*  We want to get back to Harrisburg in January. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  We want to do the people's work. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=314.3s)]
*  We want to figure out how we can work together to get good bills over to the Senate. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=316.0s)]
*  I'm so very excited to work with our governor-elect, Josh Shapiro, and Lieutenant Governor Austin [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  Davis. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=325.1s)]
*  We have serious work to do. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=326.1s)]
*  say, you know, that they now have a mirage of the majority because it is fastly going [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=328.22s)]
*  to fade. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=333.22s)]
*  It's going to fastly fade as soon as we have those special elections. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=334.22s)]
*  So, Leader McClinton, I want to broaden it out just a little bit more and ask you, from [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=337.54s)]
*  a national perspective, state by state, if you will, do you think the Democrats have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  a better sense of taking the opportunities that lie in front of them as state legislators, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=350.18s)]
*  a little bit more seriously? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=356.14000000000004s)]
*  Because for me, that's always been the play. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=358.02000000000004s)]
*  That's how you begin to really reshape the political landscape. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=360.86s)]
*  It's not top down. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=366.1s)]
*  It's not winning the presidency. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=367.1s)]
*  It's not winning the Senate or the House. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=368.1s)]
*  It's really how you grow it up from the state legislative side. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=370.94s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=374.66s)]
*  And how should Democrats see it nationally? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=375.70000000000005s)]
*  So nationally, everybody's always very excited about Washington, D.C. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  And as we say in my community, no shade. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=383.82s)]
*  But in state capitals, we get to determine what the minimum wage is. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=386.5s)]
*  We get to protect voting rights. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=390.78s)]
*  We get to make sure that those who care about choice are able to have access to all health [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=392.88s)]
*  care options for everybody who wants to access them, all of the women in our communities. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=397.5s)]
*  Harrisburg, our state capital, like so many others, Colorado, Oregon, Nevada, there are [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=402.34s)]
*  lots of states now where there are Democrats that have super majorities. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=408.05999999999995s)]
*  So I'm looking forward, recognizing that we only have flipped one chamber to work across [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=411.98s)]
*  the aisle in the Senate, to work across the aisle in the House, and to get the best idea [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=416.70000000000005s)]
*  to Governor Shapiro's desks. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=421.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, I applaud the effort and we'll stay tuned to the chaos. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=423.86s)]
*  I appreciate you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=428.82s)]
*  Pennsylvania State Representative Joanna McClinton, thank you very, very much. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfmSs0qTQEU&t=429.82s)]
