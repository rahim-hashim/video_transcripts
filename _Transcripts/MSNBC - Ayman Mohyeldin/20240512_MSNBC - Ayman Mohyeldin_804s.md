# Rep. Jayapal on contradictions in State. Dept. report on Israeli conduct in Gaza
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA)
*  October 31st, the Israeli military targeted the densely populated Jebelia refugee camp [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=0.0s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=7.12s)]
*  Dozens of Palestinians were killed, hundreds more injured. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  What you see here on your screen is the aftermath. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  The craters left behind indicate the possible use of 2,000-pound bombs in an attack that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=15.48s)]
*  the United Nations say could amount to war crimes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=21.8s)]
*  It's just one of many horrifying incidents that would be documented for the world to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  see. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=29.44s)]
*  And you're about to see what we're talking about, and it's certainly not easy to take [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=30.44s)]
*  in. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=34.28s)]
*  In February, a massacre when more than 100 people were killed while lining up for much-needed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=35.28s)]
*  food aid. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=40.64s)]
*  Witnesses say they were targeted by Israeli soldiers, something Israel denies. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=41.84s)]
*  Then, of course, in early April, seven World Central kitchen workers were killed by a lethal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=46.24s)]
*  when traveling in a clearly marked aid convoy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=52.2s)]
*  The Israeli military admitted to, quote, misidentification. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  And just last week, two young boys who were killed in Rafah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=59.24s)]
*  Here, you see their bodies being pulled from the rubble. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  The U.S. has remained steadfast in its position that Israel has not violated international [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=67.04s)]
*  law. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=72.4s)]
*  The State Department has a process in place. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=73.4s)]
*  And to date, as you and I are speaking, they have not found any incidents where the Israelis [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=76.44s)]
*  have violated international humanitarian law. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  When it relates to questions about any of these kinds of legal determinations, we have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  a rigorous process in place for evaluating these kinds of things and have not made that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=88.96s)]
*  assessment in this case. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=94.44s)]
*  This week, the question was, is the tide beginning to turn? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=97.08s)]
*  Watching President Biden on CNN talking about those 2,000-pound bombs supplied by the U.S. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=101.4s)]
*  have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  go after population centers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  The timing was interesting. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  People were wondering, is Biden finally acknowledging what aid groups, journalists on the ground, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians themselves have been documenting for months for the world to see? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=125.52s)]
*  But then again, yesterday, the State Department released a long-awaited report mandated by [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=130.24s)]
*  under a national security memorandum assessing Israel's conduct in Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=134.67999999999998s)]
*  In it, a series of head-scratching contradictions that have raised eyebrows across the political [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=139.28s)]
*  spectrum and outrage among aid organizations and legal experts. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=144.28s)]
*  The report finds that, quote, there have been sufficient reported incidents to raise serious [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=148.88s)]
*  concerns and that Israel has, quote, likely used U.S. weapons in a way that is inconsistent [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=153.72s)]
*  with international law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=160.32s)]
*  It also said that Israel has the capacity to adhere to best practices for mitigating [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=162.2s)]
*  civilian harm, but, quote, results on the ground, including high levels of civilian [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=166.92s)]
*  casualties, raised substantial questions about whether the Israeli military is making an [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=171.72s)]
*  effort to do so. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=177.0s)]
*  However, the report ultimately concludes that the U.S. does not have all of the details [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=178.88s)]
*  and that Israel hasn't shared the information necessary to verify that it used U.S. weapons [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=184.56s)]
*  in violation of international law. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=190.56s)]
*  In other words, there's still a lot that the U.S. does not know because Israel has [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=192.6s)]
*  not handed it over. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=196.96s)]
*  The report also finds that Israeli actions delayed or had a negative effect on the delivery [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=199.04s)]
*  of crucial aid into Gaza and that the aid reaching Palestinians is insufficient. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=204.44s)]
*  But ultimately, they do not currently assess that Israel is blocking U.S. humanitarian [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=209.44s)]
*  aid into Gaza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=214.76s)]
*  Clearly, the report goes to great lengths to avoid making an explicit conclusion that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=217.16s)]
*  Israel has violated international law. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  And as a result, military aid to Israel will continue under this administration. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  So what is Biden's red line here in Gaza? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=231.16s)]
*  If it's not, quote, likely violations of international law, as the report said, will it be an Israeli [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=235.68s)]
*  invasion of Rofa? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=240.72s)]
*  When Biden said he would halt arms shipments to Israel if it went ahead with its Rofa plans, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=242.84s)]
*  we know what the reaction was. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  Israel's national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir, posted on X, making the absurd [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=250.08s)]
*  statement that Hamas loves Biden. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=253.96s)]
*  And when it was revealed that Biden did pause just one shipment, literally one shipment [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=257.56s)]
*  over Israel's incursion into Rofa, a member of Israel's parliament made a threat to the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  American government, that it would use imprecise instead of the more targeted, precise ones [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=268.56s)]
*  sent by the United States against Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=274.48s)]
*  We are watching a test of wills play out here, and it's certainly happening at its most [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=279.4s)]
*  extreme, a blatant and bold disregard for American pressure on one side and an unwillingness [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=283.72s)]
*  to draw the line, no matter how many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed on [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=289.46s)]
*  the other. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=294.24s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss where we go from here is Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  of Washington. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=299.8s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to have you with us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=300.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=302.44s)]
*  I'll start broadly speaking here. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=304.04s)]
*  Your reaction to this report, the State Department's conclusion here, and what I laid out, what [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=305.92s)]
*  struck you as you read through this report? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=310.64s)]
*  Well, Eamon, it's good to be with you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=313.2s)]
*  I think, you know, going back to the president's comments on, during his interview, where he [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=316.2s)]
*  was very clear that we were not going to continue providing offensive military assistance [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=324.68s)]
*  to Israel if they invaded Ra'a, and we can talk about that red line, because I don't [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=331.68s)]
*  want it to be so thin that you can't see whether there's a line there or not. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=336.48s)]
*  But I think that was a significant policy shift for the president to say that and to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  pause the aid, which, of course, as you know, is something that I and my colleague, Madeline [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=345.56s)]
*  led 57 of our House members in asking the president to do exactly that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=351.12s)]
*  But then we are confused by this report, which, as you say, is a tremendous contradiction [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  of things. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=364.08s)]
*  And I think really, in the end, I'm just incredibly frustrated and disappointed that it muddies [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=365.44s)]
*  the water again by essentially punting the question. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  It says we didn't get the information we need, even though it says that there are a number [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=375.4s)]
*  of instances in which it is likely that Israel did violate international humanitarian laws. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=379.76s)]
*  So I don't understand why we, well, I do understand, but I see that we are not utilizing the tools [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=386.36s)]
*  that we have and we are not being clear. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=393.88s)]
*  We are muddying the water consistently. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=397.2s)]
*  We're sending very mixed messages to Israel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=399.08s)]
*  I think that the president made the right call on RAFA and on halting that shipment [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=403.32s)]
*  of bombs. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=410.36s)]
*  And he specifically talked about how U.S. bombs, it is likely that U.S. bombs have been [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=411.36s)]
*  used to kill civilians in Gaza. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  That principled call that he made, I had hoped, was the turning point in this war. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=421.0s)]
*  And I think that the NSMMO does muddy the waters. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=427.48s)]
*  But I hope that the president does not back off of what he has said. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=431.4s)]
*  And I hope, again, that this red line of Israel launching a ground invasion into RAFA, you [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=436.04s)]
*  know, what the president has said and what the White House has said is that if they go [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=443.28s)]
*  after population centers, well, we have 110,000 people right now in Gaza who have fled because [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=447.28s)]
*  of the leaflets that were dropped. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  And it certainly seems like this is a preparation. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=458.3s)]
*  And of course, you mentioned the strikes that we've been having. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=461.1s)]
*  So to me, this is a clear indication that the president needs to do what he said, which [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=464.26000000000005s)]
*  is stop offensive military assistance to Israel and to be very clear that Israel intends to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=469.66s)]
*  go forward with this RAFA invasion, whether they do it in bits, fits and starts, or whether [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=476.66s)]
*  they do it all at once. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=482.38000000000005s)]
*  And I just hope we consider that to be a crossing of the red line. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=483.5s)]
*  So you bring up a really good point, because you're talking about how Israel is going about [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=488.02s)]
*  this. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=491.46s)]
*  They've already seized the border crossing of RAFA. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=492.46s)]
*  So they've already prevented people from getting out. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=494.62s)]
*  No one's going to be able to get out into Egypt. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=497.3s)]
*  Even aid workers that are there right now are trapped inside Gaza. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=499.32s)]
*  They are carrying out airstrikes inside of RAFA, where we have seen people killed, including [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=502.88s)]
*  those two young children and others. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=507.78000000000003s)]
*  So what do you make of the ambiguity of the policy here and the language that is used [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=510.5s)]
*  in the report? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=515.7s)]
*  On one hand, it says there's a strong likelihood that Israel has violated international law. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=516.98s)]
*  Not enough hard proof to say that outright. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=521.06s)]
*  What would be enough proof, you think, for yourself, for your colleagues, for the president? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=524.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, to be honest, I have enough proof. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=529.4599999999999s)]
*  I've had enough proof for some time. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=532.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm not waiting for more proof. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=535.74s)]
*  And I don't think that we can use a roundabout argument that says Israel didn't provide us [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=537.4599999999999s)]
*  with the evidence and therefore we don't know what we think is likely. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=541.88s)]
*  I mean, this is just a roundabout circular argument. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=545.9s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=548.0600000000001s)]
*  And the reality is we can see exactly what's happening. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=549.78s)]
*  We have intelligence services that have been able to determine that it is likely that Israel [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=553.02s)]
*  has violated international humanitarian law. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=558.58s)]
*  So I just think this has become a quagmire, a very politically charged situation. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=562.58s)]
*  The president probably has no one that is satisfied with what he's doing right now. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=568.82s)]
*  For those of us who have been calling for a ceasefire for months now, we are glad to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=574.54s)]
*  see a shift in policy, but it's not coming quickly enough. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=580.42s)]
*  And then it's muddied. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=583.06s)]
*  For the people on the other side, they feel like that the president is, this is Democratic [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=584.06s)]
*  colleagues, but also Republican colleagues who have really taken to criticizing the president [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=590.5799999999999s)]
*  even for blocking that one shipment of 2000 pound bombs that are being used to kill children. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=596.14s)]
*  The president was right in halting that shipment. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=602.46s)]
*  He should continue to halt shipments. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=605.7s)]
*  He should continue to be clear that Israel is very rapidly, even in their definition [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=607.7s)]
*  of a significant full scale is what they use, full scale ground invasion into Ra'afah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=616.74s)]
*  He has to be clear that that is exactly what is happening, what Israel is preparing to [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=623.46s)]
*  do. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=629.86s)]
*  I think he doesn't back down from it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=630.86s)]
*  I think he's getting a lot of incoming. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=633.3000000000001s)]
*  I did speak to him here in Seattle a couple of times on this question over the last 24 [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=634.9s)]
*  hours. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=640.78s)]
*  I do believe that he made a principled call last week, and I think he should stick to [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=641.78s)]
*  it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=645.9s)]
*  And I think we should make sure that that red line and what he said is really what happens, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=646.9s)]
*  because we cannot be pulled into a war that Netanyahu does not want to end. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=653.34s)]
*  He doesn't want to end this war. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=656.86s)]
*  I was just going to ask you about that, because the reaction coming out of Israel is the prime [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=658.86s)]
*  minister of Israel told Dr. Phil, I guess he's commenting now on this, he basically [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=662.26s)]
*  told him that Israel is prepared to stand alone. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=666.58s)]
*  They've indicated the operation Ra'afah will go on. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=670.0600000000001s)]
*  As I said, Itamar Ben-Gavir, the national security minister, basically said that Hamas [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=672.3000000000001s)]
*  loves Biden or Biden loves Hamas, depending on how you read it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=676.54s)]
*  And more importantly, you had a member of the Israeli Knesset say that the Israeli government [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=679.22s)]
*  is prepared to use imprecise bombs if America does not provide that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=684.4200000000001s)]
*  What do you make of how the Israeli government is replying or responding to America, its [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=687.86s)]
*  largest military and financial backer, and the disregard and disrespect it is showing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=693.46s)]
*  this American administration? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=698.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a lot of posturing, and I think it is absolutely outrageous when [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=699.3000000000001s)]
*  we are the largest military backer. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=705.84s)]
*  What is necessary is for both Hamas and Israel to come to the table for the ceasefire deal. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=708.62s)]
*  My understanding is that it was extremely close. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=714.42s)]
*  And I think the problem is each side is trying to sort of make like this either is a ceasefire [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=718.14s)]
*  from the Hamas side or it's not a ceasefire from the Israel side. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=724.9s)]
*  And the reality is that's what we need to get to is a stopping of the killing, a stopping [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=728.26s)]
*  of the bombing of Gaza, release of hostages, entry of humanitarian assistance. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=734.04s)]
*  That ceasefire deal had a significant amount of humanitarian assistance going back to pre-October [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=739.64s)]
*  7th and more than that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=746.3599999999999s)]
*  And I think that is the deal that we need to get to. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=748.2399999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of posturing. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=751.18s)]
*  And Netanyahu is playing to Ben-Gavir and his other right-wing members of his cabinet, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=753.1199999999999s)]
*  but he's also playing to his own political career, Eamon. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=757.9599999999999s)]
*  He doesn't want to, he doesn't want this war to end because the minute it ends, then the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=761.56s)]
*  referendum on his leadership is going to be in question. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=766.6s)]
*  Yeah, he's defying the United States. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=770.76s)]
*  More importantly, he's defying Israelis that are now calling on him to make a deal to free [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=772.28s)]
*  those hostages and end this war. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=776.08s)]
*  Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, it's always a pleasure. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=777.76s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time and your insights. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=781.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leIkJW_1RA&t=796.6s)]
