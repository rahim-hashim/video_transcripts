# Pumping The Brakes On The Omicron Variant
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk)
*  Alright, so if you have been following the news at all this week, you've likely seen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=0.0s)]
*  a lot of headlines like these. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=5.92s)]
*  Alarming updates about the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=8.56s)]
*  Cases detected in New York, the D.C. area, California, and Georgia. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=12.9s)]
*  Headlines and breaking news alerts flying so fast at you that it's enough to actually [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=17.72s)]
*  make you scare. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=22.0s)]
*  Now listen, some scientists think that Omicron may become the dominant strain of COVID-19. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=23.6s)]
*  So if a case of Omicron hasn't been announced in your area yet, it's probably just a matter [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=29.82s)]
*  of time before it does. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=35.94s)]
*  Now I'm not trying to make light of the situation, it's just the truth. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=37.9s)]
*  That's why I need everyone watching this program tonight to do two things for me. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=42.38s)]
*  Take a deep breath, pump the brakes a little bit. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=46.6s)]
*  Because even with all the scary headlines about Omicron, the basic message remains the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=49.42s)]
*  same. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  Wear masks in public, especially if you're indoors. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=55.14s)]
*  Avoid crowded indoor gatherings. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=58.26s)]
*  Get vaccinated. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=60.26s)]
*  And get a booster if it's been more than six months. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=61.4s)]
*  We got to, you know, we're going to get to everything you need to know about the Omicron [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=64.62s)]
*  variant in just a second with Dr. Vingupta. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=67.74s)]
*  But there is a bigger question here that I wanted to explore tonight. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=70.62s)]
*  How do we make sense of all the news about this variant without actually being alarmist [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=74.34s)]
*  or perhaps worse, complacent? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=79.88s)]
*  You know, for a case study on how not to handle this situation, let's take a look at how public [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=82.5s)]
*  health experts handled the early days of the pandemic in 2020, particularly around the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=87.38s)]
*  area of masking. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=92.46s)]
*  Now if you've got an anti-vax friend, which I'm sure some of you do, you've likely heard [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=93.46s)]
*  from them over the past two years, you know, from Dr. Fauci and others talking about, you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=98.3s)]
*  know, masks and how they once said, we didn't need to be wearing masks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=104.42s)]
*  Now at the time, there were concerns about PPE shortages and there not being enough [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=110.5s)]
*  PPE for first responders. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=115.38s)]
*  That's what they were saying. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=117.58s)]
*  But that's not what they said at first. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=118.86s)]
*  In emails from early February of 2020, Fauci said that masks were unlikely to be effective [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=121.02s)]
*  and Surgeon General Jerome Adams at the time even said that masks could increase the risk [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=126.4s)]
*  of catching COVID. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=130.9s)]
*  The guidance has since been updated. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=132.5s)]
*  It's evolved as we've come to understand that masks are an effective tool to limit the spread [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=134.3s)]
*  of the virus. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=140.1s)]
*  But it would have been better to be upfront about the need to make sure that first responders [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=141.34s)]
*  had enough masks first. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=146.34s)]
*  Now listen, I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here about masking or rag on Dr. Fauci [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=148.7s)]
*  any more than he normally gets from critics and certainly those on the right. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=152.94s)]
*  But that lack of candor early on created a little bit of doubt and confusion. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=157.5s)]
*  And doubt and confusion leaves room for the bad faith actors, many of them in the Republican [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  Party on the right to put out counter messaging that is actively harmful in our fight against [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=168.38000000000002s)]
*  this pandemic. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=174.82000000000002s)]
*  Now here's something to keep in mind. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  The anti-vaxxers and the COVID deniers don't have to be right to convince people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  They can say whatever they want about this virus or any other virus. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=183.06s)]
*  It doesn't have to be true so long as the people listening to them buy it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  And they are. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=191.62s)]
*  But public health officials don't have that luxury. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=192.62s)]
*  Their currency is based on trust. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=195.7s)]
*  At the end of the day, they have to get this right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  They have to strike the right balance to win over the American public. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ii-Mad2Hk&t=201.22s)]
