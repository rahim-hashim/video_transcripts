# First Black mayor of Tulsa Monroe Nichols on being elected 103 years after Tulsa Race Massacre
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8)
*  Despite the disappointment and setbacks we saw Tuesday night, there were also some uplifting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=0.0s)]
*  reminders that progress takes time, but it will come. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=5.28s)]
*  Even in the most unexpected places, even a state like Oklahoma, where every single county [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=9.06s)]
*  went red, and even in a city like Tulsa, which was the site of one of the most vicious racially [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=12.86s)]
*  motivated attacks in U.S. history. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=18.76s)]
*  103 years ago, a violent and heavily armed mob of white residents stormed into the black [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=20.88s)]
*  neighborhood of Greenwood and carried out what is now known as the Tulsa Race Massacre. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=26.06s)]
*  Greenwood had been a thriving community of prosperous black owned businesses, so much [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=31.3s)]
*  so that it was known as America's Black Wall Street. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=35.58s)]
*  It was a testament to the progress made by black Americans after the Civil War, but it [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=38.3s)]
*  was all erased on the night of May 31st, 1921. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=42.7s)]
*  The lynch mob, motivated by their resentment and incited by a lie, burned the businesses [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=46.82s)]
*  to the ground, destroyed hundreds of homes, and virtually leveled 35 square blocks. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=51.46s)]
*  Most experts and historians believe the full extent of what happened is still unknown, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=57.9s)]
*  but as many as 300 people are believed to have been killed, which is obviously a big [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=62.58s)]
*  part of the tragedy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=68.54s)]
*  It also left a void in generational wealth that reverberates today. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=69.54s)]
*  And wealth can never be made right. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=73.86s)]
*  Never. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=75.54s)]
*  We were reminded this week that things can get better. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=76.54s)]
*  Because this week, the city of Tulsa elected its first ever black mayor, State Representative [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=79.22s)]
*  Monroe Nichols. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=83.5s)]
*  And on Tuesday night, he delivered his victory speech while standing inside the very building [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=84.5s)]
*  erected to honor the legacy of Greenwood. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=89.02s)]
*  A victory alone does not guarantee that our challenges are behind us, but it does provide [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=93.66s)]
*  us with the greatest gift we could ever ask for, the opportunity to move beyond them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=98.9s)]
*  The opportunity not to be defined by our past, but together to build a brighter future. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=107.5s)]
*  To build a brighter future. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=115.1s)]
*  I think a lot of people need to hear that right now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=116.62s)]
*  And that moment inside the Greenwood Cultural Center was a reminder I think many of us need [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=118.62s)]
*  that progress can be frustratingly slow. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  But that doesn't mean it's not possible. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=126.22s)]
*  Joining me now is Tulsa's mayor-elect, State Representative Monroe Nichols. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=128.78s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=132.12s)]
*  First, I just have to ask. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=133.12s)]
*  Obviously, there's a lot of historical significance to your win. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  I tried to do it justice there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=137.3s)]
*  Tell me if I missed anything. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=139.06s)]
*  But how are you absorbing the win in this moment? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=140.58s)]
*  You know, first of all, thank you for allowing me to come on today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=143.9s)]
*  It's a really exciting time in Tulsa. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=150.02s)]
*  The biggest thing for me was having my 16-year-old son there to be in the Greenwood Cultural [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=152.94s)]
*  Center and to know even on a day where a lot of folks felt like things are tough around [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=157.5s)]
*  the country, there's a lot of hope and optimism here in Tulsa. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=161.82000000000002s)]
*  I think today, every day is a new reminder, Jen. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=165.3s)]
*  When I get off this interview, I'm actually going to celebrate the 110th birthday of Mother [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=168.62s)]
*  Randall, who was one of the last two remaining survivors. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=173.58s)]
*  So, you know, I think about the awesome responsibility of being mayor of this city. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=176.78s)]
*  But also, you know, really, as I said in the speech, all of the opportunity we have out [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=182.58s)]
*  in front of us to, you know, right the wrongs of the past as much as we can, but to really [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=186.02s)]
*  work to build a brighter future. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=190.58s)]
*  You know, it's a great day in Tulsa, but we got our work cut out for it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=192.26s)]
*  110th birthday. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=195.42s)]
*  I love to hear that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=197.62s)]
*  Now, you ran as a Democrat, you won in an overwhelmingly red state. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=198.82s)]
*  I just kind of went through the details there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=203.38s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=205.38s)]
*  You're the first Democrat elected there since 2006. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=206.38s)]
*  Why do you think you were able to break through during an incredibly difficult cycle for Democrats [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=209.5s)]
*  across the country? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=215.3s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think it's because we talked about issues from start to finish. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=216.82000000000002s)]
*  And I think this is a lesson that we need to learn on the Democrat and Democratic Party. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=221.82000000000002s)]
*  We have got to center people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=226.78s)]
*  And I think we're also starting to learn about cities. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  Cities are the place of great innovation about how we solve some of these big problems across [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=234.34s)]
*  Everything I heard you talk about housing, homelessness, public safety, education. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=235.34s)]
*  Cities are a place where all these issues just hit all in one area where we all have [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=240.34s)]
*  to figure out, do it together. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=243.9s)]
*  And I think this is a good sign that issue-based campaigns can work. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=245.6s)]
*  Even if, you know, you're also trying to make history with trying to transcend race and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=250.44s)]
*  partisanship, if you center people and you're not afraid to go in places where people say [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=254.84s)]
*  you shouldn't go, you can make some amazing progress. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=259.4s)]
*  That's the lesson that we learned in 2024. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=262.88s)]
*  And I think our city is going to be better because of it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=265.0s)]
*  And Jen, this is the other thing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=266.68s)]
*  I think it's really interesting about the history that we made, largely driven by the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=267.68s)]
*  But more voters voted for mayor this year than any other time in our history. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=272.44s)]
*  And it just happens to be the time where we're elected the first person of color. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=276.44s)]
*  So what that tells me is the more voices that are at the table, the better off we are. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=280.76s)]
*  And that's another important lesson we've learned about this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=284.9s)]
*  We can make history and we do it together. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=287.4s)]
*  More voices were heard. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=289.36s)]
*  We elected our first black mayor of the city. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=290.64s)]
*  And now it's time to channel that and do really great things for this community. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=292.68s)]
*  No, more voices is definitely part of the road to progress, unquestionably. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  You're a part of that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=302.32000000000005s)]
*  We played part of your victory speech. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=304.48s)]
*  I watched it also. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  And you talked in there about bipartisanship, which I think a lot of people hear and then [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=307.48s)]
*  they hear, is it really possible to do that and make progress? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  And you alluded to voters feeling like they didn't have a candidate who represented them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=315.86s)]
*  And that can mean a lot of things. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=320.42s)]
*  And especially in this moment, as everyone's reflecting, what do you think it means? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=322.92s)]
*  What does it mean to you? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=326.32s)]
*  I mean, I think it means there's a lot for the reality is a lot of people don't feel [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=329.24s)]
*  like anybody's talking to them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=332.28s)]
*  And they think that everything sounds the same. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=333.96s)]
*  I think it doesn't matter. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of people don't show up to vote, not because they don't think their individual [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=337.0s)]
*  vote matters, but because oftentimes they don't believe that even if their preferred [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=340.96s)]
*  candidate wins, their life is not going to change. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=344.92s)]
*  And so that means it's incumbent on us to show people how their life is changing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  I saw just before when you were talking about the numbers on the economy is different than [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=350.6s)]
*  what people feel. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=354.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  We got to make sure we're reaching out to people and helping them understand the difference [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  that it's making. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=360.2s)]
*  Progress takes time. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=361.76s)]
*  You know, turning the economy around takes time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=362.76s)]
*  But we have to constantly go back to folks and engage them on the things that we're doing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=364.68s)]
*  to understand the other day we're doing this together. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=370.24s)]
*  And give people some agency. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=371.24s)]
*  I think that's what this election started to do. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=372.24s)]
*  But when I was referring to those folks who felt disenfranchised, I was thinking about [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=374.59999999999997s)]
*  the folks who are like, man, you know what? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=377.84s)]
*  I would like for this person, this person win. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=380.32s)]
*  But whoever wins, my life is not going to change. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=382.12s)]
*  We have to go out and prove to people that we can change their lives, improve their situation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=384.5s)]
*  And that starts to do it with them, not to them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=388.62s)]
*  Yeah, that is such an important engagement, meeting people where they are. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=391.22s)]
*  It's such an important part. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=395.5s)]
*  I know your focus is understandably on the future of Tulsa. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=396.78s)]
*  You have a lot ahead of you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=399.78s)]
*  It's so exciting. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=400.78s)]
*  There's obviously a lot of soul searching happening within the Democratic Party right [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=401.98s)]
*  now, which I think is an important thing. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=405.7s)]
*  If party leaders came to Tulsa or they called you and asked you for your advice, what would [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=408.22s)]
*  you tell them? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=412.62s)]
*  I would tell them that we have to get out of this frame that only a couple of states [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=415.5s)]
*  matter, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=420.78s)]
*  We have to talk to everybody because what we know oftentimes, I think this is the reality [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=422.5s)]
*  that's played out, starting in the last few cycles, is these presidential races. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=427.42s)]
*  We're coming back to fix things oftentimes. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=431.7s)]
*  And fixing things is hard. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=434.26s)]
*  But we forget to communicate to people the difference that's been made, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=436.06s)]
*  We kind of leave people behind at times. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=439.8s)]
*  And we expect folks just to understand we're here to do great things for them. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=441.66s)]
*  We have to engage people. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=445.22s)]
*  We have to meet them where they are. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=447.42s)]
*  The fact there's been so many burn-off of voters of color and things like that means [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=449.38000000000005s)]
*  that not that they don't care about the future of the country, it means that we're not talking [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=453.1s)]
*  to them in ways that resonate. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=456.94000000000005s)]
*  We're not showing them that we can improve their communities. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=458.98s)]
*  What I would tell anybody who came, and look, I'm not the foremost expert on national politics, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=461.68s)]
*  but I would tell them, you went it on Main Street. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=466.58000000000004s)]
*  You went it in neighborhood. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=469.66s)]
*  You went it talking about education. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=470.66s)]
*  You went it talking about balanced economic growth. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=471.98s)]
*  You went it talking about solving problems and allowing people to take this country to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=474.70000000000005s)]
*  the next level. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=478.42s)]
*  We do those things. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=479.42s)]
*  We won't have problems like we had on Tuesday. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=480.76000000000005s)]
*  We do those things. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=482.88000000000005s)]
*  We'll take back Congress. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=483.88000000000005s)]
*  We do those things. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=484.88000000000005s)]
*  Most importantly, we will improve this country in ways in which we talk about doing every [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=485.88000000000005s)]
*  two, every four years. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=490.74s)]
*  Mayor Lex Monroe-Nichols, an inspiring story. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=493.06s)]
*  Can't wait to see what you do. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=495.82000000000005s)]
*  And thanks so much for taking the time. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=497.66s)]
*  I'm sure you're just still digesting all of it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvIV0TSwm8&t=500.54s)]
