# Attorney for abducted Tufts student Rümeysa Öztürk speaks out on her detainment
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4)
*  If I told you that masked secret police were caught on camera kidnapping a college student [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=0.0s)]
*  for her political views, you'd probably think that it was happening in some foreign country [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=6.2s)]
*  run by a dictator. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=10.96s)]
*  But this was the scene on Tuesday night, not in a foreign country, right here in America, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=12.88s)]
*  in fact, in Massachusetts, the birthplace of the American Revolution. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=17.88s)]
*  That is where a Tufts University Ph.D. student and a Fulbright scholar was abducted. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=22.52s)]
*  Ramiza Ozturk had just left her apartment to attend a dinner, breaking her Ramadan fast, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=29.96s)]
*  when all of a sudden she was approached by a guy in a dark hoodie and a hat who then [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  grabs her hands, and you can see and hear how upset and scared she was, as an officer [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=40.04s)]
*  finally pulls out a badge and appears to identify himself as law enforcement. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=47.08s)]
*  Within seconds, she is surrounded by half a dozen cops, all in street clothes and all [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  covering their faces with masks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=58.72s)]
*  They take her cell phone, physically remove her backpack, and her crime, you'd think [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=61.04s)]
*  that this was somebody really wanted by the government, someone dangerous, but her crime [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=66.0s)]
*  appears to be co-authoring an op-ed in the school newspaper back in 2024. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=70.28s)]
*  The piece cites Tufts University's 1989 decision to divest from apartheid South Africa [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=75.06s)]
*  as part of an international boycott against that racist regime. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=81.02s)]
*  She calls on the university to divest in the modern era from Israel, due to the International [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  Court of Justice finding Israel plausibly committing genocide. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=92.38s)]
*  And for that opinion, for that op-ed, Ozturk was essentially kidnapped off the street. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=96.78s)]
*  She was sent to a detention center in Louisiana, with the Trump administration now hoping to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=102.5s)]
*  deport her out of the country. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=107.02s)]
*  If it sounds familiar, it is. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=109.66s)]
*  In fact, it is a similar story to that of Mahmoud Khalil of Columbia University. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=111.62s)]
*  And it happened to a number of other foreign students across the country, again, with no [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=116.02s)]
*  evidence made to the public. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security is accusing her of engaging in activities in support of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=122.56s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=127.66s)]
*  You know what? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=129.0s)]
*  Her op-ed didn't even mention Hamas. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=130.04s)]
*  While DHS carries out the abductions, it is the Secretary of State who's officially making [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  the call on who and why these students are abducted off of the streets and tried to be [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=137.18s)]
*  deported. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=142.32s)]
*  This was how Marco Rubio explained his abduction on Tuesday. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=143.48s)]
*  Oh, we revoked her visa. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  It's an F-1 visa, I believe. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=150.68s)]
*  We revoked it, and here's why. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=152.76s)]
*  If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=154.18s)]
*  the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=158.36s)]
*  op-eds but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=165.78s)]
*  we're not going to give you a visa. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  If you lie to us and get a visa and then enter the United States and with that visa participate [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=178.08s)]
*  And to be clear, there's absolutely no evidence that this young woman has engaged in any of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=180.8s)]
*  the activity that Marco Rubio has just talked about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=187.38s)]
*  She has not been charged with any crime from the Department of Justice or any prosecutors. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=190.5s)]
*  Keep in mind that Republicans have been pretending throughout all of this to be the champions [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=195.18s)]
*  of free speech in America for the past few years. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=200.3s)]
*  In fact, this was Marco Rubio at CPAC back in 2022. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=202.54s)]
*  There's now a speech code, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=207.96s)]
*  Every single person in this room and the overwhelming majority of people that you know are one word [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=211.26s)]
*  away. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=216.58s)]
*  It didn't matter if you're 13 years old when you said it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=217.58s)]
*  You're one word, you're one statement, you're one retweet, you're one like away from destroying [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  your life. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=225.22000000000003s)]
*  There are kids in America, there are kids in America that have been had their admissions [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  to a college revoked. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  There are now certain things that you're not allowed to say on a college campus. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=232.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=236.78s)]
*  But beyond the hypocrisy of Marco Rubio, there's another huge flaw in what the Trump administration [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  is actually arguing here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=243.68s)]
*  We're citing a rarely used Cold War law that says that a secretary of state can deport [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=245.48s)]
*  non-citizens if their activities pose a potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequence. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=250.48s)]
*  First of all, it's obviously laughable that student protesters or op-eds and student newspapers [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=257.36s)]
*  pose a serious threat to U.S. foreign policy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  Honestly, we'd be much better off if these protests actually had any kind of impact on [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=267.08s)]
*  our foreign policy. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=272.92s)]
*  But there's another huge flaw in what Marco Rubio and, by extension, Donald Trump are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=274.56s)]
*  saying. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=278.18s)]
*  The Columbia student encampments, which Mahmoud Khalil was a part of, they actually took place [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=279.22s)]
*  in the spring of 2024. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=284.22s)]
*  You know who was president at the time? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=286.68s)]
*  Joe Biden was the president. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=288.72s)]
*  Rumiasa Ozturk's op-ed, that was published March 26 of 2024. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=290.66s)]
*  That was when Joe Biden was president. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=296.5s)]
*  So think about this argument for a second. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=298.26s)]
*  Is Marco Rubio seriously arguing that the Trump administration is abducting and attempting [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=301.24s)]
*  to deport these students for undermining Joe Biden's foreign policy? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  Didn't Donald Trump oppose Joe Biden's foreign policy? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  Didn't Marco Rubio? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=315.04s)]
*  I know I certainly did on this show. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=316.04s)]
*  So what's really going on here? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=319.68s)]
*  Why are these students being targeted? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  It's pro-Israel groups such as Canary Mission, Bittar U.S., and the Miriam Adelson-backed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=324.22s)]
*  Maccabi Task Force that are behind these abductions. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=330.04s)]
*  And they're proud of it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=333.36s)]
*  Bittar U.S. is described in today's Washington Post as a militant Zionist group that's been [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=334.84s)]
*  around for a century. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=339.76s)]
*  They are so extreme that even the Anti-Defamation League, you know, which supports the detention [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=341.52s)]
*  of Mahmoud Khalil, they list Bittar as a hate group that openly embraces Islamophobia and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=346.92s)]
*  harasses Muslims online and in person. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=353.14s)]
*  But it's not just Muslims that Bittar attacks. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=356.56s)]
*  In February, Bittar targeted Jewish professor and author Peter Beinart, posting on X that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=359.04s)]
*  if anyone sees Beinart on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, they should give him a pager. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=363.28s)]
*  Sick stuff. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=370.24s)]
*  Beinart responded, Oppose my ideas all you want, but when you urge people in my neighborhood [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=371.88s)]
*  to give me a pager in the wake of Israel's pager attacks in Lebanon, that sounds like [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=377.28s)]
*  a death threat. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=382.98s)]
*  This is the militant group that took credit for Mahmoud Khalil's abduction and claims [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=384.46s)]
*  it has sent thousands more names to Trump officials. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=389.02s)]
*  This is the kind of group aiding the Trump administration in what Massachusetts Congressman [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=394.09999999999997s)]
*  Stephen Lynch and New York Congressman Dan Goldman both compared to Gestapo-like conduct, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=398.44s)]
*  referring to the Nazi secret police. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=404.62s)]
*  But these Gestapo tactics aren't happening in a foreign country, not in a bygone era. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=407.97999999999996s)]
*  They are happening right here in the United States today. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=413.42s)]
*  And the Trump administration is promising more to come unless we do something about [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=418.02000000000004s)]
*  it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=424.38s)]
*  Massa Kambabi is Romyza Ostark's attorney. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=425.38s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=428.58000000000004s)]
*  Massa, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=429.58000000000004s)]
*  First of all, as Romyza's lawyer, has the government been honoring her right to an attorney? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=432.82s)]
*  Have you had a chance to speak to her, to access her throughout this ordeal? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=438.86s)]
*  What can you tell us about where she is and how she's doing this evening? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=443.06s)]
*  Good evening, Ayman. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=445.98s)]
*  Thank you for having me on today. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=448.1s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's been difficult, to be honest, to communicate with my client. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=449.82s)]
*  We had incredible difficulty at first in even finding her. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=454.02s)]
*  It took nearly 24 hours to learn that she was in Louisiana, despite the judge's order [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=457.82s)]
*  not to remove her from the state. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=462.5s)]
*  And then it took another 24 hours to be able to communicate—well, the same 24 hours to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=465.14s)]
*  her then. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=471.5s)]
*  And she was incredibly exhausted. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=473.18s)]
*  It was difficult to speak with her. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=474.5s)]
*  And even since then, it's been difficult to talk with her by phone. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=476.02s)]
*  She's unable to give me a call when she normally should have the authorization to call me. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=481.02s)]
*  So we are concerned about what condition she's facing in the detention center and her ability [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=486.62s)]
*  to reach out to family and counsel. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=493.02s)]
*  Let's talk about the, I guess, like, underlying principle of her detention per the American [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=495.62s)]
*  government, this administration, and this point that I made in the introduction about [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=500.82s)]
*  how disingenuous it is for Marco Rubio to be claiming that these students were somehow [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=505.06s)]
*  undermining American foreign policy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=509.21999999999997s)]
*  When the conduct in question actually occurred under President Biden, is it just a case of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=512.06s)]
*  them being disingenuous, or might that hypocrisy actually help the students in the court system? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=516.84s)]
*  I mean, I think it's absolutely ironic that the secretary of state was talking about, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=523.98s)]
*  you know, we're one word away, when the one word's away that Romesa was, was the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=528.8199999999999s)]
*  equal dignity and humanity of all people. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=534.22s)]
*  That's what she wrote in her op-ed. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=536.6999999999999s)]
*  And then to try to backdate, you know, to retroactively apply someone's speech, it's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=539.34s)]
*  just absolutely unconstitutional. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=545.5799999999999s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this before. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=547.14s)]
*  In fact, one of my neighbors was telling me today, I feel like we're on a different [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=549.62s)]
*  planet. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=553.7s)]
*  This doesn't feel like Earth. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=554.7s)]
*  Yeah, it seriously does not feel, it certainly does not feel like America, as far as I've [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=556.7s)]
*  known it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=561.34s)]
*  You know, all of these abductions of these students, foreign students, including Mahmoud [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=562.34s)]
*  Khalil, who is a permanent resident here, have led to questions about who in America [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  has what rights and who the Constitution protects. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=570.54s)]
*  I want to show you and our audience a clip of former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=575.62s)]
*  conservative icon, who was asked specifically about the First Amendment and who that applies [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=581.5s)]
*  to. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=587.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=588.5s)]
*  To whom does the First Amendment apply? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=589.5s)]
*  Do undocumented immigrants have the five freedoms? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=591.98s)]
*  Oh, I think so. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=597.5s)]
*  I think anybody who's present in the United States has protections under the United States [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=601.7s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=610.0200000000001s)]
*  One of the most conservative justices in this country's history, and in this case he was [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=611.74s)]
*  talking about undocumented immigrants. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=615.74s)]
*  Just to be clear, undocumented immigrants having these rights. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=618.3000000000001s)]
*  Your client has a student visa, was here legally, Mahmoud Khalil, here legally. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=620.88s)]
*  What residents, in your interpretation, what rights do people have here on student visas [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=626.38s)]
*  when it comes to the issue of free speech or other sanctioned activities? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=633.06s)]
*  I absolutely agree with the former Supreme Court. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=638.54s)]
*  And you know, obviously students are here to learn. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=643.54s)]
*  They're here to communicate, to advocate. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=646.74s)]
*  And in fact, Rue Mesa was a teacher. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=650.86s)]
*  She's an educator. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=653.58s)]
*  It's all about communication, learning from one another, getting to know one another. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=655.5s)]
*  And actually that's one of the biggest reasons I fear that we're having these problems in [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=659.22s)]
*  America is because people are afraid of one another. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=663.62s)]
*  We don't have the opportunity to get to know each other and learn from one another and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=666.18s)]
*  to then accept what people have to say. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=670.18s)]
*  And we might not agree with it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=673.66s)]
*  And in fact, that's why Rue Mesa has been targeted. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=675.42s)]
*  We talk about free speech, but when it comes to free speech about Palestine and the genocide [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=678.26s)]
*  that we're seeing right now, it's a different story. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=683.98s)]
*  If she were advocating for Ukrainians or climate change or reproductive women's rights, would [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=686.6600000000001s)]
*  this have happened to her now? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=692.5s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=695.62s)]
*  But unfortunately, on the track that we're going down, where all the guardrails that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=696.62s)]
*  we've had on our government seem to have just broken off, I'm afraid that those types [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=701.2600000000001s)]
*  of advocates are also going to face future problems. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  And what's going to happen? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=709.1400000000001s)]
*  Are they going to be picked up and kidnapped off the streets like Rue Mesa was? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=710.14s)]
*  I'm really concerned about what we're seeing. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsWptdLwsb4&t=714.02s)]
