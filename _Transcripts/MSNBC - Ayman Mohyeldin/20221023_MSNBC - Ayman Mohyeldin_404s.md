# Midterm Elections Headed For Chaos
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0)
*  Right now, there is a very real possibility that the midterms could slip into chaos, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=0.0s)]
*  that is unsurprisingly because of far-right Trump loyalists. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=7.96s)]
*  A new Reuters investigation found a wave of pro-Trump activists are working to replace [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=13.02s)]
*  local government leaders with election deniers. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=18.56s)]
*  The outlet identified 44 counties in 15 different states where local officials have faced efforts [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=21.72s)]
*  to change voting rules since the 2020 election, and all signs point to Nevada being ground [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=27.9s)]
*  zero for this crisis. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=33.72s)]
*  Let's look in at it for a moment. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=35.3s)]
*  Ten of Nevada's 17 counties have seen their top election officials resign, retire, or [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=37.46s)]
*  decline to seek reelection since 2020. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=43.58s)]
*  Four of those officials said that the harassment or continued efforts to challenge the 2020 [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=48.86s)]
*  results were among their reasons for leaving. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=53.82s)]
*  And as the Washington Post's Dana Milbank warns, the worst-case scenario for Nevada [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=57.059999999999995s)]
*  is that conspiracy-minded county commissioners might refuse to certify the results, which [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=61.9s)]
*  raises the likelihood that the state legislator could step in and throw out the results in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=68.06s)]
*  any contested state election, from assembly all the way up to governor and install the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=72.34s)]
*  candidate of their choice, something that actually is allowed under Nevada law. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=77.3s)]
*  Joining me now is Cisco Aguilar. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=82.06s)]
*  He is the Democratic nominee for one of the most important positions in that state, Secretary [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=83.9s)]
*  of State for Nevada. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=88.72s)]
*  Sir, thank you so much for making time for us this evening. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=89.98s)]
*  Let me just start out by your concern. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=92.98s)]
*  How concerned are you about what is going on in your state right now? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=96.28s)]
*  How concerned should the rest of the country be? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=100.44s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad to be here to explain the situation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  We are definitely concerned here in Nevada, but we are prepared. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  We're working hard to ensure that every vote in Nevada is counted. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=111.26s)]
*  We are going to be there to be prepared. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  We have legal protection ready to go. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=116.06s)]
*  The Democratic Party is working hard to ensure that all Nevadans' votes are counting in this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=118.44s)]
*  election cycle. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=122.42s)]
*  Your opponent, Jim Marchant, appeared at a Trump rally two weeks ago. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  I want to play for you and our viewers some of what he said. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=127.5s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=131.18s)]
*  You're going to elect me as your Secretary of State because I oversee the election system. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=133.18s)]
*  We're going to make sure that you have a fair and transparent election system, because [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=139.18s)]
*  if we do, we are a red state, I guarantee you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=146.94s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to respond to that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=151.86s)]
*  What do you make of what he said and what he continued to say as well about, and some [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=153.62s)]
*  interpreted it as him saying if he is elected, he would make sure that in 2024, Donald Trump [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=158.24s)]
*  will be president. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  Some people interpreted that as rigging the election for him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  It's unfortunate because he hasn't appeared before Nevada voters to explain his positions [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=171.16s)]
*  or why he's running for Secretary of State. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  All of a sudden, he appears on a national stage to say that he's determined the election [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=177.34s)]
*  for Nevada without knowing the will of Nevada voters. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=181.12s)]
*  That's unfortunate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  We've looked for him all over the state to confront him on those issues or to have a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=186.1s)]
*  discussion of why he believes what he believes, but he's refused to appear and he's refused [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  to explain to Nevadans why he has that belief. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  It's unfortunate. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=197.22s)]
*  It's unacceptable. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=198.22s)]
*  Look, he's not a serious candidate for Secretary of State, but the threat he represents is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=199.22s)]
*  extremely serious. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  We are here to combat that and explain away why he's telling lies to Nevadans consistently. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=204.89999999999998s)]
*  His allies have targeted the ballot drop boxes and mail-in voting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=212.74s)]
*  Jim Marching, our opponent, has called for running elections by paper ballots and hand [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  counting, which I guess is going back to the 1800s. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  What is your reaction to these proposals that they're doing? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  Again, he's trying to change the rules on the election cycle because he knows that if [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  he doesn't change the rules, he and his friends cannot win elections like this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  Extremists are not welcomed in Nevada. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=239.78s)]
*  Nevada want people who are pragmatic, who are going to be honest and tell them the truth [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=242.18s)]
*  and be transparent about their actions and decisions when it comes to the election cycle. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=245.82s)]
*  Nevada's worked really hard to increase access. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=250.58s)]
*  We have same-day voter registration. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=253.0s)]
*  We have early voting, which started today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  We're pretty excited about it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=256.9s)]
*  We also have mail ballots, which are making elections extremely accessible throughout [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=258.5s)]
*  the state. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=262.46s)]
*  You know, Nevada has a very urban core, but we have a very strong rural community. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=263.46s)]
*  We also have a very strong native community. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=267.66s)]
*  In the last election cycle, native communities have increased their engagement in voting [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=269.96s)]
*  by 25 percent. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  That's pretty incredible. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=275.02s)]
*  We need to continue to fight for more access, and we need to continue to make sure that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=276.06s)]
*  all Nevadans have the opportunity to express their opinion. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=279.44s)]
*  Look, this is no longer about Democratic or Republican priorities. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  What this is about is protecting the rights of Nevadans across the state, whether you're [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=285.64s)]
*  Republican or Democrat. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=289.56s)]
*  We need to ensure that we're listening to our citizens and doing what's in the best [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  interest. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=293.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, Jim Marchant continues to lie to all Nevadans about the vision and the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=294.96s)]
*  future of the state, and that's unacceptable. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=298.76s)]
*  Let me ask you about voter intimidation, if I can. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  There are local reports in Arizona that say on Friday night police were called to investigate [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=303.84s)]
*  armed and masked individuals near a ballot drop box. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's just, you know, one of the latest alleged voter intimidation examples in that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  state. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  Arizona's Secretary of State Katie Hobbs has already referred the matter to the Department [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  of Justice. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  Have you seen any similar allegations in your state? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=324.92s)]
*  Are you concerned about voter intimidation in your state? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  I am absolutely concerned, and that's why if I'm elected Secretary of State, the first [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  bill we would introduce into the upcoming legislature is to make it a failing to harass [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  or intimidate election workers and volunteers. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  They are humans. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=343.92s)]
*  They are neighbors. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=344.92s)]
*  They are relatives. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=345.92s)]
*  They're doing the job we need them to do to protect our democracy and make sure that the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=346.92s)]
*  system is fair and transparent for all Nevadans. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  It's unacceptable that people would have to go to work in fear. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=352.88s)]
*  It's not a great state to know that when you're working in fear, you're not going to get the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=355.92s)]
*  results that we need to have, especially when you're trying to protect our democracy and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=359.24s)]
*  make sure that all elections are secure, but also to making sure that everybody's vote [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=363.32s)]
*  counts and everybody's vote counts equally. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=367.68s)]
*  All right, Cisco, Aguilar, sir, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=370.2s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your insights this evening. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=374.2s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=377.32s)]
*  Glad to be here. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydObx9yCqm0&t=378.32s)]
