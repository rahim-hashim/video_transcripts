# Washington Gov. Jay Inslee pushes back on the GOP's authoritarianism
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8)
*  Either on that decision, sorry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=0.0s)]
*  Blue states are fighting to protect your rights. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=3.86s)]
*  And nowhere is that more evident right now than in Washington, state, where Governor [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=5.86s)]
*  Jeh Inslee, just this week, signed a series of gun reforms into law, gun reforms into [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=9.76s)]
*  law, excuse me, including one that made Washington the 10th state to ban sales of AR-15s and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=14.9s)]
*  dozens of other semiautomatic rifles. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=20.22s)]
*  And on the same day, Republicans in Iowa passed the most sweeping anti-trans bathroom law [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=22.5s)]
*  on the nation. Governor Inslee was signing legislation to protect out-of-state patients [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=27.4s)]
*  seeking gender-affirming care and abortion care from being prosecuted. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=32.48s)]
*  The governor also announced his state was taking the unprecedented step of stockpiling [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  a three-year supply of the medication abortion pill, Mifrepristone, calling it a, quote, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=41.42s)]
*  insurance policy, as the future of the drug hangs in the balance. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=47.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Washington Governor Jay Inslee. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=51.16s)]
*  Governor Inslee, it's great to see you again. Thank you so much for coming back on the show. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=53.56s)]
*  So it's obvious that you've been very busy. Let's talk about that, you know, in a broad [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=56.72s)]
*  sense here. Talk about the work you and the legislator have been doing to shore up and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=62.16s)]
*  protect the rights of your constituents. And broadly speaking, what do you see that is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=65.84s)]
*  happening across the country compelling you to take these measures? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=70.02s)]
*  Well, listening to your depiction, what I can say is our state has been fighting aggressively [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  and most importantly successfully against this right-wing agenda that's going across [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=82.36s)]
*  the country. And it's interesting listening to your depiction. I had kind of an insight. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=89.24s)]
*  The three things you mentioned to protect a woman's right of choice, to do common sense, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=94.84s)]
*  gun safety legislation, to stockpile Mifrepristone, those things, they have something in common. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=100.16s)]
*  They represent the vast majority of what Americans think, actually in red and blue states. And [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=109.0s)]
*  what we're doing is standing up for democracy, frankly, where legislators are not protecting [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=116.4s)]
*  the right of choice. Like in Kansas, for instance, the people voted to protect the right of choice. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=123.68s)]
*  The effort to keep weapons of war out of our schools, the vast majority of Americans believe [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=129.32s)]
*  that is a common sense measure. So what I would say is the things that we are fighting for in this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=135.6s)]
*  regard are not just democratic principles, they're ones that the vast majority of Americans believe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=141.0s)]
*  And I'm glad to be one of the governors in blue states who are moving to protect these rights. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=146.64s)]
*  And I'm really proud of what our state has done. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=153.16s)]
*  When you talk about the fact that the majority of Americans support these measures or wanting to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=155.64s)]
*  ban, for example, assault rifles in our schools and classrooms, does that mean the through line [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=161.28s)]
*  between all of these is that there is a broader attack on the democratic will of the people of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  this country? I mean, when you have states going around the courts, when you have people kicking [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=171.68s)]
*  off legislators from their seats, when you have people refusing to ban assault rifles from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=176.24s)]
*  classrooms, does that mean our democracy is under attack? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=181.52s)]
*  Very much so. Democracy is under attack right now, obviously in January 6th, when the insurgency took [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=186.44s)]
*  place. But there are broader and actually more persistent attacks on democracy, packing the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=192.28s)]
*  courts as Trump did. The terrible gerrymandering that's gone on, which really denies people the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=199.48s)]
*  legitimate right to choose their representative. The North Carolina Supreme Court just made an [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  issue that basically will allow the Republicans to gerrymander that beautiful state, the unall [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=213.88s)]
*  human recognition. The filibuster has prevented the majority will from moving for the U.S. Senate. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=219.04s)]
*  The attack on voting rights by the Republican Party that has tried every way they can to suppress [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=226.32s)]
*  the number of people who actually vote, we protect that. We think voting by everyone, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=232.4s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans, we should inspire. Republicans are afraid of the majority will. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=237.76s)]
*  That's why they believe in gerrymandering, making it as difficult as possible to vote. And now the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=243.56s)]
*  assault coming from the U.S. Supreme Court on our rights of choice are obvious. So I do think this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=250.12s)]
*  is a matter of the policies involved in common sense gun safety, the policies involved in a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=255.96s)]
*  woman's right of choice. But it's democracy itself that we ought to be fighting for right now. And [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=262.04s)]
*  we're doing that big time. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=268.04s)]
*  You were the first blue state to secure a stockpile of methapristone. Massachusetts has since [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=269.36s)]
*  followed suit, New York as well. Talk about the importance of protecting that access for [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=275.52s)]
*  your constituents and why you did it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=280.64s)]
*  Well, I think we have to realize that a woman's right of choice is going to be under attack now [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=282.24s)]
*  for years to come by the Republican Party. And we have to be very forward thinking and creative. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=288.16s)]
*  So what I did is order our Department of Corrections, because they're a licensed pharmacy, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=294.16s)]
*  to stockpile several years of methapristone before the Texas court decision came down. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's important because now that we have the product in our state, no matter what happens at [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=306.32s)]
*  the Supreme Court level, and this surprises some people, even without FDA approval, our state is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=311.52s)]
*  eligible to distribute this very safe and very effective product for the last two decades, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=317.68s)]
*  we will be able to distribute this even if the Supreme Court plays games with the FDA [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=323.36s)]
*  approval. We've also passed a shield law, which prevents other states like Texas and Idaho [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=330.56s)]
*  trying to come into our state and use our judicial system to longfully and in an [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=337.12s)]
*  unconstitutional matter, try to enforce their bans on a woman's right of choice. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=342.72s)]
*  And so I think this is a first of many of the things we're going to have to do creatively. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=348.32000000000005s)]
*  We need to be on the balls of our feet. This is going to be a long struggle. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=352.4s)]
*  And I'm glad that we've other states have joined Washington state in this regard. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=356.0s)]
*  NICK SCHIFRIN [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I would actually, this may seem a little strange, but I'd like them to be honest, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=382.4s)]
*  because if they're honest, they will say they'll do everything humanly possible to dictate [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=388.56s)]
*  as a politician to order an American woman to carry a pregnancy to term. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  That is, if they're honest, they're going to get voted out of office big time, as they were in the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=400.08s)]
*  last midterms. It was supposed to be a big red wave, hardly a red wave. We saw the first evidence [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=405.44s)]
*  that Americans want to protect a woman's right of choice. I actually think a lot of people are [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=412.4s)]
*  going to ignore that counsel. They're going to try to run it high. They're going to try to obfuscate. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  They're going to create fog. But we know they're coming for a woman's right of choice. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=420.56s)]
*  This is going to be a voting issue. And I think we're on the right side, both of Americans' [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=425.52s)]
*  democracy and American women in this case. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=431.76s)]
*  NICK SCHIFRIN Let me get your thoughts on my interview that I just had with [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=434.0s)]
*  Montana State Representative Zoe Zephyr, who was barred from the state House chamber by Republicans [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=438.56s)]
*  for the rest of the legislative session. What do you make of the increasingly authoritarian [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=443.44s)]
*  tactics of state Republicans? We also saw similar tactics in Tennessee. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=448.0s)]
*  JOHN BARRASSO Well, I think it's of a piece of the anti-democracy system that, unfortunately, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=454.24s)]
*  that party is now embracing. It runs through the insurgency on January 6, voter suppression, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=461.44s)]
*  gerrymandering, and now this, to actually try to silence people who have a position in legislatures. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=467.76000000000005s)]
*  The first thing I can say about it is, it's not working. It's not working for them. People [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=473.68s)]
*  believe voices need to be heard in our democracy. It has highlighted actually the causes that these [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=480.08s)]
*  legislators have stood for of justice and civility and allowing people to speak. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=486.8s)]
*  Look, I understand the need to have debates, but there's a lot better ways to handle this [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=494.56s)]
*  than they're doing, because they're actually trying to suppress arguments in their chambers. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=499.28s)]
*  It's an anti-democracy measure, but it's just part of what they've done. And it's sad. I [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=503.92s)]
*  actually believe we need two great parties. I think we need honest debate. But we ought to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  let people vote and we ought to let people speak. And when those two things are under attack, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  as they are by the Republican Party across the country, we've got to be aggressive. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=520.96s)]
*  NICK SCHIFRIN Let me speak to you, sir, if I can, about some party politics. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=525.36s)]
*  As you are very well aware, President Biden has announced his reelection for 2024. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=530.0s)]
*  And I wanted to get your thoughts on politics here for a moment. Do you think he is? I mean, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=535.2s)]
*  he's framed the conversation as a battle for the soul of America, kind of like what you have done [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=540.16s)]
*  right now. Do you think he is the right man for this fight for the next four years? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=544.56s)]
*  GOV. JOHN BARRASSO You bet. I'm 100 percent for him. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=549.2s)]
*  I have seen him do amazing things. You may know that I have been very passionate to try to fight [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=552.64s)]
*  climate change for the last several decades. And what he was able to achieve was truly stunning [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=557.12s)]
*  in the Inflation Reduction Act to create $360 billion of investment to help Americans get [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=564.0s)]
*  access to clean energy, and most importantly, to grow millions of jobs, as we are doing in our state, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=569.28s)]
*  even with our clean energy action. This is a stunning achievement and it's coming just [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=575.36s)]
*  at the right moment. We need someone who follows the science, who is willing to create jobs. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=579.76s)]
*  He knows how to do that. I love his theme. Let him finish the job. I'm all for that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=585.84s)]
*  So it will be a thousand percent. The J and Joe stands for jobs. And we like that attitude. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=591.44s)]
*  J. ANTONY CHENG, Washington, Governor, J. Inslee. It's always a pleasure, sir. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=597.28s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on. We hope to see you again. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMq7PBUXf8&t=600.64s)]
