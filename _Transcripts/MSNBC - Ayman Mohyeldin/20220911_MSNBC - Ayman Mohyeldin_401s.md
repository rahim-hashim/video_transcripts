Video Description: Justice Department lawyers slammed Judge Aileen Cannon’s decision to allow a Special Master to review documents recovered from Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort as a risk to national security in a new filing this week. The news that DOJ officials are appealing Cannon’s decision is just the latest legal woe for Trump and his allies. This week, MAGA loyalist Steve Bannon was arrested on multiple charges and a federal grand jury has been convened to examine the finances of a Trump super pac created after the 2020 election. Congressman David Cicilline joined MSNBC’s Katie Phang to discuss the myriad headaches for the former president.

# Trump Faces A Deluge Of Legal Woes
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo)
*  A risk to national security. That's how Justice Department lawyers are describing a federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=0.0s)]
*  judge's decision to allow a special master to review evidence seized from Donald Trump's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=9.0s)]
*  home last month. This week, the DOJ filed a motion to appeal Judge Aileen Cannon's ruling, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=13.64s)]
*  arguing that even a temporary halt to the criminal investigation into Trump's mishandling [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=19.88s)]
*  of classified materials could cause, quote, irreparable harm to our national security [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=24.92s)]
*  and intelligence interests. This comes as a series of inflammatory headlines sends Trump [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=30.12s)]
*  world into a deeper tailspin, including new reporting from the Washington Post that materials [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=35.88s)]
*  detailing a four nations nuclear capabilities were recovered at Mar-a-Lago during the FBI's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=41.6s)]
*  search. Whether that country was a geopolitical ally or adversary remains unknown. Joining me [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=47.52s)]
*  now is Democratic Congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island. He's a member of the House Judiciary [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  Committee and the author of House on Fire, Fighting for Democracy in the Age of Political Arson. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for joining us this evening. You also serve on the House Foreign Affairs [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  Committee, which is responsible for national security developments affecting foreign policy, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=72.2s)]
*  among many other things. I mean, just how gravely should we be assessing this reporting that Donald [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=76.52s)]
*  Trump had documents detailing another country's nuclear capabilities in his beachfront golf club, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=81.96s)]
*  of all places? Yeah, this revelation is very, very alarming. We know now, of course, that the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=87.24s)]
*  former president had more than 300 documents that were classified or highly classified at his [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=95.16s)]
*  resort or home in Mar-a-Lago. A hundred of those seized during the execution of the search warrant [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=101.96s)]
*  most recently. And now we're learning that some of the information that was contained [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=107.8s)]
*  with classified documents is some of the most sensitive and most secret of national security [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=111.96s)]
*  secrets. In fact, some of those classifications are so great that only the president and a certain [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=117.56s)]
*  very limited number of people can view them. And I think we saw today from Secretary Clinton, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=122.44s)]
*  documents like that used to arrive to her in a sealed briefcase attached to someone's arm [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=127.64s)]
*  so that it was secure. And so these are very, very highly sensitive. The potential consequences [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=135.16s)]
*  for our national security are very great if they were ever revealed and they were not secured [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=140.68s)]
*  properly, taken away from the White House improperly, and not turned over when they were [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=145.96s)]
*  demanded to be turned over. So this is deadly serious. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=150.52s)]
*  Congressman, I want to apologize. I'm having a little bit, I'm having problems hearing you, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  but apparently you're able to hear me. So I'm going to keep on going because I obviously value [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  your time and the opportunity to have you here. I'm going to pivot a bit now, Congressman. You [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  know, the Department of Justice moved to appeal Judge Cannon's ruling on the necessity of a special [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=172.52s)]
*  master in this case. However, both the DOJ lawyers and Trump's attorneys proposed possible [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=177.64s)]
*  candidates to serve as special master yesterday. I'd like to get your thoughts on what I think are [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  stall tactics, frankly, by Donald Trump claiming a need for a special master and the nominees that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  have been put forth for the job. Yeah, I think all the legal scholars who've looked at this said that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=194.2s)]
*  a special master is not necessary. There's no basis really for it. And it's clearly an effort [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  by Donald Trump to muck things up and delay this ongoing and very serious criminal investigation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=206.52s)]
*  Department of Justice filed a plea today that said, look, if you're going to appoint a special [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=212.12s)]
*  master at the very least, do not apply that to the hundred documents that we have already identified [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=215.8s)]
*  as highly classified and allow the government to continue to look at those documents, continue its [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  ongoing criminal investigation and its risk assessment by the national intelligence agencies. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=226.52s)]
*  Hopefully the judge will allow that. But look, this is an effort by the former president to do [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=232.44s)]
*  what he always does, to distract and delay, to avoid accountability. The Department of Justice [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=237.4s)]
*  is not going to allow that to happen. And we have confidence that the Department of Justice is going [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=243.0s)]
*  to press hard so they can continue its work to demonstrate no one is above the law. And if someone [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=247.32s)]
*  steals classified documents from the White House, doesn't secure them properly and refuses to return [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=252.92s)]
*  them, they must be held accountable, especially when it endangers the national security license. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=258.6s)]
*  Nobody gets to do that, especially a former president of the United States. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=263.72s)]
*  You know, Congressman, Donald Trump doesn't operate in a vacuum. He has enablers. You [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=268.76000000000005s)]
*  served as one of the impeachment managers for Trump's second impeachment trial where four to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=273.72s)]
*  three Republican senators voted in support of his acquittal. Fast forward 18 months later, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=278.20000000000005s)]
*  GOP senators again expressing support for him in this Mar-a-Lago search issue, with some like [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=282.6s)]
*  Marco Rubio going so far as to say that it's, quote, just a storage issue. Your latest book, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=287.0s)]
*  House on Fire, Fighting for Democracy in the Age of Political Arson, sounds the alarm on your [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=292.76s)]
*  Republican colleagues' ability to continue to make excuses for somebody like Donald Trump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=298.12s)]
*  In your opinion, is there a tipping point for Republicans that's ever going to be enough [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=303.96s)]
*  to change their blind loyalty to him? We certainly haven't seen any evidence of that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=308.12s)]
*  One of the reasons I wrote the book was really to say to the American people and to make the case [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=313.88s)]
*  that democracy is on the ballot in the midterm elections. We have one political party that is [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=318.84s)]
*  fighting hard to protect democracy, to protect the rule of law, to make sure that no one is above [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=323.32s)]
*  the law in this country. We have another party that is the Republican party that is actually [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=328.36s)]
*  working to undermine democracy, is making excuses for the president, still promoting the big lie, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=332.52s)]
*  minimizing this very serious taking of classified documents out of the White House and, frankly, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=337.96s)]
*  endangering the national security of the United States and the men and women who served our [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=346.35999999999996s)]
*  intelligence community and the law enforcement agencies that are conducting this investigation. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=350.76s)]
*  They're making claims like we should defund the FBI and kind of mocking the serious work of the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  Department of Justice. This is very dangerous. Whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, or [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=360.44s)]
*  an American, we all should protect the rule of law, the truth, and the fact that no one is above [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=364.6s)]
*  the law and hold everyone accountable who is engaged in misconduct, even the former president [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=370.04s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEboh1utzeo&t=374.44s)]
