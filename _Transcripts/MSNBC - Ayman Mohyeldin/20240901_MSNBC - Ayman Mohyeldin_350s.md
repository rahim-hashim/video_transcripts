# 'A bunch of nuts and kooks and weirdos': Trump's new transition team
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8)
*  Trump went all in on conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who just shut down his ill-fated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=0.0s)]
*  presidential campaign and one-time Democratic presidential candidate turned Russian propagandist [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=6.72s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=11.64s)]
*  If you don't believe me, check out this ridiculous meme Trump shared on his failed social media [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=13.02s)]
*  platform. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=17.56s)]
*  It features R.F.K. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=18.56s)]
*  Jr. and Gabbard, as well as familiar faces and friends like J.D. Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=19.56s)]
*  and Elon Musk, and Trump himself, of course, as none other than members of the Justice [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=25.639999999999997s)]
*  League. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=30.68s)]
*  The only thing more unhinged than a former president posting that meme? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=31.68s)]
*  Kennedy, announcing Monday that he will serve on Trump's transition team to, quote, pick [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=35.36s)]
*  the people who will be running the government. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  Both Kennedy and Gabbard have been tasked as honorary co-chairs of Trump's transition [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=43.16s)]
*  team, but a campaign senior adviser confirmed to the New York Times that members of that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  team will help Trump select personnel and policies. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=52.16s)]
*  God help us all if they win. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=55.72s)]
*  Brian and Stuart are back with us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=58.08s)]
*  Brian, I'll start with you here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=60.28s)]
*  The idea that Trump and J.D. Vance, Superman and Batman, and members of the Justice League, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=62.64s)]
*  I don't even know where to begin with that one. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  Any thoughts? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=71.28s)]
*  Look, if you're trying to escape the weird allegations, then perhaps the first decision [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=72.28s)]
*  you make is to tap the guy who is best known at the current moment for loading up a bear [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=79.76s)]
*  carcass into his car in New York City and then staging it in a bicycle accident. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  All this does is really cement what we already know, which is Donald Trump's second term [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=91.4s)]
*  would be staffed by people who are not only insane, which is what the RFK Jr. thing does, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  but also aggressively inept and also dangerous. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=102.84s)]
*  We know from Project 2025, for example, I think the scariest part of Project 2025 is [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=107.62s)]
*  this element where all federal employees would be reclassified as political appointees, meaning [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=112.7s)]
*  Donald Trump would not only be able to appoint for his inner circle the dangerous people [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=118.14s)]
*  who surround him, the crazy people who surround him, the people like RFK and Tulsi Gabbard [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  and on and on, but also the entirety of the federal government. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  Think about how that would manifest itself in the DOJ, in the FBI, the FCC, the IRS. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=131.34s)]
*  All this is is a blinking red light to the rest of us. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=136.62s)]
*  Stuart, what's the political calculation that Trump is making here with Gabbard and RFK [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=139.26000000000002s)]
*  Jr.? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=144.74s)]
*  Quite honestly, unless he's about to create the Department of Conspiracy Theories, and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=145.74s)]
*  that's what RFK Jr. is going to be in charge of, there really is no political gain by giving [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=149.46s)]
*  them such prominent roles. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=156.0s)]
*  I understand you want to make a gesture to try to bring in whatever percentage of voters [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=157.0s)]
*  they may have that are loyal to them, but that's an insignificant amount. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  What is Trump thinking by prominently featuring both the Russian conspiracist and the tinfoil [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=165.68s)]
*  hag guy? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=173.06s)]
*  You know, I think we always have this sort of need to say there must be some strategy [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=174.06s)]
*  to this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=179.56s)]
*  Otherwise, it just seems like madness and he looks like a blithering idiot. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=180.56s)]
*  There's no strategy to this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=184.82s)]
*  It is madness. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=186.16s)]
*  It is a blithering idiot. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=187.16s)]
*  You know, Trump is, you know, to pet him, he will follow you home. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=188.16s)]
*  And that's what these two people have done. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=192.54000000000002s)]
*  They flattered him. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=195.2s)]
*  And so this is sort of like cool people that Donald Trump would like to hang out with. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  And I would just like to say to all of my Republican friends, all those people I helped [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=201.64s)]
*  elect, all the people, we said the government was serious. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=205.56s)]
*  Remember, Republicans are going to be the party of adults. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=207.92s)]
*  This is what you've turned the party over to, okay? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=210.64s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  A bunch of nuts and cooks and weirdos who have no interest in governing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  You have made one of the most serious endeavors in our world governing the United States into [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=219.92s)]
*  a non-serious absurdity. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=224.64s)]
*  And it is completely on you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=227.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=229.04s)]
*  And to that point, Brian, actually, to Stuart's point, Mark Short, Republican strategist and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=230.04s)]
*  former chief of staff to Mike Pence, slammed Trump for recruiting R.F.K. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  Jr. and Gabbard, saying doubling down on big government populace will not energize turnout [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=237.92s)]
*  among traditional conservatives. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=242.92s)]
*  What do you think is behind this decision, Brian? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=246.11999999999998s)]
*  R.F.K. and Tulsi have become MAGA celebrities in their own right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=248.32s)]
*  Has Trump dug a hole with them that he can't get out of? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=252.5s)]
*  Look, I think Stuart's point is actually the exact right one, which is Donald Trump [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=256.14s)]
*  will move over and embrace anybody who pets him, basically. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=262.3s)]
*  And it's indicative of a larger problem, because you see how the world's autocrats [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=267.22s)]
*  and dictators want a useful idiot in the White House. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=271.82s)]
*  And so that's why he has the support of the Vladimir Putin's out there, the president [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=275.26s)]
*  cheese out there, the Erdogan's out there, because they know they can all they have to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=279.66s)]
*  do is flatter him, say something nice to him, and they will wholly own him because that's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=284.3s)]
*  all he's looking for in some colleague and some other world leader. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=289.46s)]
*  And then once they have him under their thumb, they can use him in any way they want to, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=294.36s)]
*  like, for example, undermining NATO, which has been the goal of Russia for the entirety [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=298.1s)]
*  of Putin's presidency there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=302.82s)]
*  So this just is indicative, again, of a broader problem with Donald Trump, which is he will [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=305.76s)]
*  embrace anybody who is nice to him. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=312.08s)]
*  And it's very easy to get him to do that, to manipulate him, to bend him to your will. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=314.52s)]
*  Yeah, sad state of affairs to see someone like that now vying for the highest office [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=319.2s)]
*  in the country. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=324.58s)]
*  Brian Tyler, co-host Stuart Stevens, gentlemen, thank you both. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=325.58s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your insights this evening. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DU_ekt4Uh8&t=328.12s)]
