# Trump's firing of FTC commissioners speaks volumes about his love for billionaires
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ)
*  The president moving full speed ahead with firings at agencies that are designed to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=0.0s)]
*  independent from the White House. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=5.96s)]
*  He recently illegally fired the only two Democratic members at the Federal Trade Commission, which [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=7.48s)]
*  effectively keeps corporate America in check. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=11.82s)]
*  Trump attempted to remove Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from their posts before [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=14.6s)]
*  their terms were up, a move they both planned to sue against. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=19.52s)]
*  In the words of Bedoya himself, it's a corruption, plain and simple. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=23.84s)]
*  The FTC commissioner recently joined Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Ocasio-Cortez on their fighting oligarchy tour. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=32.72s)]
*  And here's what he said Friday in Denver. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=35.72s)]
*  This is not about me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=39.12s)]
*  This is not about my colleague. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=40.68s)]
*  This is about the billionaires over President Trump's shoulder at the inauguration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=42.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=49.44s)]
*  Because every one of those men is being sued or we are enforcing court orders against every [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=53.28s)]
*  one of their companies. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=60.04s)]
*  Alvaro Bedoya joins me now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=63.56s)]
*  Alvaro, it's great to have you on the show. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=65.12s)]
*  You laid out very clearly in the clip that we just played. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=67.42s)]
*  This is not about you or your fellow commissioner, Rebecca Slaughter. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=70.58s)]
*  It is about the billionaires that we are seeing next to Trump almost every single day of his [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=73.72s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=79.4s)]
*  Tell us more about that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=80.4s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=82.04s)]
*  Let's talk about those men. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  You've got Mr. Bezos, Mr. Zuckerberg and of course Mr. Musk. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  The FTC is responsible for enforcing a 20-year privacy order against Elon Musk's company [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=89.04s)]
*  X. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=95.56s)]
*  We are about to go to trial next month against Metta for its over its acquisition of Instagram, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=96.56s)]
*  which we allege was anti-competitive. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  And we are suing Mr. Bezos in not one but two separate court cases. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=104.44000000000001s)]
*  I think one of the most important cases overall is one of those litigation where we are alleging [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=110.52s)]
*  that Amazon is ripping off small business sellers on its site by making them pay up [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=115.72s)]
*  the 50 cents on every dollar they earn there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=119.88s)]
*  And so my fear is that if the president can fire me and Commissioner Slaughter or anyone, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=122.38s)]
*  it is an open door to basically what are corporate pardons of all of those companies. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=127.8s)]
*  Implicit in firing you is that those that are going to be on the commission would be [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=132.92s)]
*  less willing to stand up to these oligarchs or these companies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=136.58s)]
*  Based on your experience, do you feel that as an accurate assessment they wanted to get [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=142.62s)]
*  rid of you so that the others who occupy the position or who have the title of commissioner [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  are simply rubber stamping what this administration wants? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  Am I getting that correct? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  The message I think could not be clearer. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=156.38000000000002s)]
*  If you see your colleague gone in a matter of moments with a quick email from the White [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=158.3s)]
*  House when the statute, when the Supreme Court has said you cannot do that, it is a clear [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=164.9s)]
*  signal to you or anyone that it could be you next. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=171.9s)]
*  Tell me about how you want to fight back. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=175.38000000000002s)]
*  I understand you are planning to take Trump to court over his legal firing which violates [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=177.74s)]
*  Supreme Court precedent from nearly 100 years ago. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=182.12s)]
*  What does that mean for your case? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=185.74s)]
*  Will the Trump administration try to overturn that Supreme Court ruling on the limits of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  presidential power with the firing of FTC commissioners, you think? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=191.3s)]
*  Commissioner Slaughter and I will be filing imminently, I think, and we will have more [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=196.26000000000002s)]
*  news to share on that soon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=200.66000000000003s)]
*  The other thing we will be doing in parallel, Aiman, is pointing out who wins from this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  and also the impact of this on the FTC. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  One case, for example, that Commissioner Slaughter and I are sitting as judges on involves allegations [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=210.78s)]
*  that pharmacy middlemen called PBMs are actually competing not to lower the price of insulin [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=216.26s)]
*  but to raise the price of insulin. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=222.01999999999998s)]
*  We're going to be pointing out to the public that if me and Commissioner Slaughter are [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=224.82s)]
*  gone, the fate of that case is entirely unclear. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=228.34s)]
*  This isn't just about big tech, this isn't just about the billionaires behind the shoulder, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=232.34s)]
*  it's also about people being able to afford insulin, people being able to not get ripped [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=236.54s)]
*  off by their corporate landlords who, again, we're taking to court. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=240.98s)]
*  It's not just going to be about us, it's going to be about those people trying to make rent. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=244.42s)]
*  I have to say, I suspect that most people don't know what the FTC does and how it affects [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=249.05999999999997s)]
*  their day-to-day lives. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=253.45999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  Tell us, in a nutshell, the importance of the FTC. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=255.45999999999998s)]
*  What does the agency do and why is it so critical for the way commerce and business flows in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=258.78s)]
*  this country? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=262.9s)]
*  We sue fraudsters and monopolists. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=265.3s)]
*  We take on the Martin Shkrelys and Jeff Bezos of the world, and we win. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=269.02s)]
*  For example, if you're worried about the prices of the medicine you take, the prescription [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=274.14s)]
*  medicine you take, we were the ones who got Martin Shkrelys banned from the pharmaceutical [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=278.05999999999995s)]
*  industry for life. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  I was just talking about corporate landlords. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=284.02s)]
*  Right now we're suing a company called Grey Star, one of the largest corporate landlords [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=286.73999999999995s)]
*  in the country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  We allege they packed people's rent bills with all these hidden fees, junk fees, things [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  like, oh, you don't want pests in your building, you're going to have to pay extra for that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=295.29999999999995s)]
*  You want water and lights in the common areas of the apartments that we run? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=300.7s)]
*  Got to pay extra for that, too. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=304.06s)]
*  What we're working hard to try to do is keep things affordable, keep things fair for small [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=306.02s)]
*  businesses. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=309.7s)]
*  That's the kind of work that FTC does day in, day out. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=310.94s)]
*  Let me just get, finally, your thoughts. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=313.74s)]
*  People may be watching this, may feel discouraged. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=315.82s)]
*  What is your message to people about what we need to be doing, what we need to be concerned [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=318.42s)]
*  about, not just that Donald Trump has been able to fire you and your colleague, but with [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=323.58s)]
*  Trump's second term more broadly? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=329.26s)]
*  Look, right now there is a decision this country needs to make. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=331.26s)]
*  Will this be a country of rule of law, or will it be a country of rule of billionaires? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=338.52s)]
*  And there's a lot of choices people can make in the day to day, but I would add one small [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=344.0s)]
*  thing you can do is reach out to a federal public servant in your life and tell them [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=348.4s)]
*  what they mean to you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=353.36s)]
*  Ask them how you can help. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=354.36s)]
*  Because right now, people like me may be on television, but it's the folks at our agencies [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=355.96s)]
*  that are wondering what's going to happen next, that are wondering whose orders they're [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=360.08s)]
*  going to have to follow. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=363.62s)]
*  Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya, thank you so much for coming out tonight. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=365.68s)]
*  We'll be following this story closely and look forward to having you back on as your [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  case and others develop. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=371.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=372.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=373.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=374.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c7yMG4ejQ&t=385.96s)]
