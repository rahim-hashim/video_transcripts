# 'Point-blank voter intimidation': LULAC leaders call out Ken Paxton's raids on members
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8)
*  When 87 year old Lydia Martinez woke up before 6 a.m. To the sound of a knock on her door last week [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=0.0s)]
*  She assumed it was perhaps a neighbor who needed milk or eggs, but to her surprise it wasn't a neighbor [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=6.44s)]
*  Rather nine officers most of them men pushing through her front door some had riot shields and guns in their holsters [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  The officers presented a search warrant and questioned her for three hours at one point [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=20.64s)]
*  They even had the great-grandmother stand outside in her nightgown [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=25.2s)]
*  According to their warrant officers were looking for records including applications for ballot by mail a list of voter banks and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=29.54s)]
*  documents about elected officials and candidates [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=38.06s)]
*  Martinez said the officers told her they were there because she had filled out a report saying that older residents were not getting mail ballots [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=41.06s)]
*  That's quite an aggressive response to that report, which she confirmed. She actually did file [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=49.22s)]
*  Martinez is a retired educator in San Antonio who had spent 35 years as a member and volunteer [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=55.1s)]
*  With LULAC the oldest Latino civil rights group in America part of her work with that organization includes helping older residents and veterans [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=61.42s)]
*  Register to vote and that's apparently what made her suspicious to Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Monday [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=69.54s)]
*  Martinez and other LULAC leaders held a news conference outside of Paxton's office in San Antonio [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=76.5s)]
*  They took my laptop [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  My appointment book I don't I don't know when I have an appointment with my doctors [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  They took my cell phone [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  They took all the information that I had I had two sons and two daughters and they don't want me involved in this anymore [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  They're scared that I'm going to be in prison and I said they can't they I'm not doing anything illegal [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  Martinez was just one target of raids on several Latino Democrats [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=107.16s)]
*  And new LULAC members in South Texas [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=111.48s)]
*  They are all part of a two-year investigation into alleged election fraud and vote harvesting conducted by Paxton's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=113.48s)]
*  Election integrity unit that's the same unit that was created in the wake of Donald Trump's fake election claims during the 2020 presidential election [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=120.04s)]
*  Now, of course, no charges have been filed against those who have had their home searched this month [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=128.44s)]
*  So what does this new stunt by Paxton actually achieve besides? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  Fuelling fear his raids left his targets shaken up and scared and outside the Latino community [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=138.2s)]
*  They push a false narrative about non-citizens supposedly voting illegally [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=145.56s)]
*  The Texas attorney general has been eager to advance this baseless claim about voter fraud throughout his career [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=150.04s)]
*  On a radio show earlier this month. He said quote there's a reason joe biden brought people here illegally [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=156.84s)]
*  I'm convinced that's how they're going to do it this time [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=162.2s)]
*  They're going to use the illegal vote and to be clear here absolutely clear [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=166.04s)]
*  US law already bans non-citizens from voting in federal elections and as election officials and experts have repeatedly said to us [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=170.76s)]
*  There's no evidence of widespread voter fraud in texas or this country at large [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=178.44s)]
*  You know, it is true though [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  Texas's long history of discrimination against its citizens of mexican descent [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  It's actually why the historic latino civil rights organization came together in the first place back in 1929 [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=189.96s)]
*  As you can imagine these raids felt deeply personal to lulac's leaders and members the group's national president roman [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=195.96s)]
*  Paro maras called them quote point-blank voter intimidation [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  And now lulac has turned the tables on paxton by calling on the justice department to investigate the investigator [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  You know the one desperately searching for voter fraud [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  And for potentially violating the voting rights act of 1965 [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this and more is lulac's ceo juan frauño. Juan. It's great to have you on the show [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time for us. So [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=226.84s)]
*  Just walk me through what has happened since that incident with miss martinez [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=229.24s)]
*  Have has there been any more insight into what they were trying to achieve what they plan on doing and have her possessions been returned her? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=235.32000000000002s)]
*  Number one her possessions have not been returned to her [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=243.72s)]
*  We've got a lot more information relative to the other warrants that were served [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  To victims to our best knowledge there were about 12 of them [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=251.32s)]
*  We've spoken with five four of those are lulac members [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  We have sent the letter to the department of justice [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=259.32s)]
*  Asking for an inquiry and we will be meeting with them as early as next week to actually provide them with all the information that we have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=262.44s)]
*  Relative to this case, what do you want the department of justice to do in this inquiry? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=269.4s)]
*  I assume they haven't responded to yet to perhaps respond to you in person when you meet with them [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=273.64s)]
*  But what is it that you're seeking from the department of justice? Well, we want an investigation [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=277.88s)]
*  I think both on the civil justice side, but also on the criminal side as well [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=282.44s)]
*  You know, we believe that lydia martinez's civil rights have actually been violated and so we want them to investigate that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=286.28s)]
*  I was gonna say ken paxton seems to have launched, you know [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=293.56s)]
*  Kind of an attack now on organizations in texas [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=297.48s)]
*  And you know you if you're on if you're an outside observer you can you can say with some degree of confidence [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=301.8s)]
*  This has the hallmarks of voter intimidation [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=307.24s)]
*  When you're targeting groups [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=311.24s)]
*  And trying to undercut their ability to vote freely and fairly and feel confident in their vote [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  You're doing a great disservice to our democracy [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=320.04s)]
*  Um, how do you fight that? How do you counter that? How do you get these organizations to mobilize in this? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=322.6s)]
*  Tactics. Well, first and foremost, there's a pattern here, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, we've been talking about the raids for the last week [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=332.36s)]
*  But if you go back to june, he actually filed a lawsuit against the catholic charities of rio grand valley sister norma pimentel [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  In july, he also filed suit against an annunciation house which provides respite services for immigrants in the in the united states [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=342.12s)]
*  And all those non-profit organizations and all those latino leaders civic leaders lulac members are all latino [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=350.44s)]
*  So there's no question that he is targeting the latino community [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=357.64s)]
*  One of the things that we're doing in our response is that our response will not be only a latino response [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  We're working with the nwacp [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  Uh met yesterday with eric johnson with mark marial from the urban league with maya wiley from the leadership conference [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=369.08s)]
*  With hector barba from mi familia vota [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=376.68s)]
*  So our response will be one of the civil rights community fully intersectional taking into account hispanics african-american and the asian community as well [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=379.47999999999996s)]
*  Let me share with you something that the governor has been doing greg abbott [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=388.44s)]
*  He purged one million people from the state's voter rule saying that illegal voting in texas will not be tolerated [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=392.2s)]
*  um, but the majority of voters data shows that were removed from the rules either passed away [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  Or failed to respond to notices from election officials or just moved out of texas [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=404.52s)]
*  Do you believe there is a concerted effort to fear monger right now ahead of the election? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=409.08s)]
*  And create this sense of intimidation [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=413.88s)]
*  You know, I I think he actually put that out because he put that out last friday as number one a way to a way to deflect [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=415.64s)]
*  from the story [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=422.28s)]
*  This negative story that has impacted his administration and paxton [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=423.8s)]
*  But in addition to that it actually really undercuts their argument of systemic voter fraud and voter harvesting [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=427.8s)]
*  6500 of those [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=434.1s)]
*  Persons actually removed from the voter role were defined as non-citizens [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=436.76s)]
*  Right 6500 of 1.1 million records is less than half of a percent [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  1900 of those 6500 [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=447.14000000000004s)]
*  Actually had voting history [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=449.72s)]
*  So you're talking about less than one one thousand of a percent of the people that were on those voter vote rolls are [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=451.48s)]
*  non-citizens [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  immigrants if you will [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=460.76s)]
*  That's not statistically insignificant. Yeah, emic voter fraud. That is not systemic. Uh voter harvesting [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=462.52s)]
*  It undercuts their entire argument [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  What i'm concerned about is that he gave those 1900 records literally handed them over to paxton [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=471.4s)]
*  And our expectation is he's going to go after them [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=478.35999999999996s)]
*  He's looking for the living embodiment and he's going to arrest someone on those 1900 [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  Let me just ask you really quickly and we're almost out of time [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=485.88s)]
*  But why do you think they are so afraid of latinos in texas? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=487.8s)]
*  Why do you think there is such a concerted effort to go after this kind of like invisible bogeyman? Well, it's [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=492.04s)]
*  Not invisible. There's 12.1 million latinos in texas [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  Latinos are 40 of the population [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=503.16s)]
*  It's actually greater than the 12 million non-hispanic whites that live in the state and when you take into account hispanics [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=505.64s)]
*  african-americans and asians that's 60 of the population [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=512.66s)]
*  Texas is and has been a majority minority state for some time. This is their way to stay in power [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=517.26s)]
*  Not just to keep the control of the state [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=525.26s)]
*  But there are districts and 50 50 districts that are changing dramatically because of these demographics [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=527.34s)]
*  Uh juan peranio. Thank you so much [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=533.34s)]
*  It's a it's a pleasure to speak to you and we're going to certainly stay on top of this story [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=534.86s)]
*  In the weeks and months ahead, please come back. Thank you. Thank you so much [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=538.7s)]
*  You [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJyOZkGub8&t=546.46s)]
