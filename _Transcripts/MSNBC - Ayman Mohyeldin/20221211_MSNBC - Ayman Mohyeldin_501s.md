# Rep.-Elect Jasmine Crockett Reacts To Democrats’ Winning Streak
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0)
*  So, from the White House's vantage point, President Biden cannot stop winning. That [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=0.0s)]
*  is the message we're ending this year on, because there is a massive string of victories [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=11.6s)]
*  this week to reinforce that theme. There was WNBA star Brittany Greiner being released [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=15.66s)]
*  from a Russian penal colony in a high-profile prisoner swap. Americans now have more money [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  their pockets. Wages have increased more than 5% over the last year, and gas prices have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  dropped to their lowest levels in 12 months. And there's a massive boom of advanced chip [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=31.860000000000003s)]
*  manufacturing that is coming to the United States. That is a major win in Biden's push [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  to stand up a domestic supply chain. Now, the president's on a serious winning streak, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  and even his opponents recognize it. Just this week, former Republican House Speaker [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  Newt Gingrich wrote that the GOP has to quit underestimating President Biden. In his words, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=51.3s)]
*  conservative hostility to the administration has blinded his colleagues to just how effective [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=57.3s)]
*  Joe Biden has been on his terms. And it's even more impressive considering the president's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=62.82s)]
*  relatively soft poll numbers. Again, just this week, the president led his party to victory [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  in the state of Georgia, making 2022 the first midterm since 1934. That is 88 years ago, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  when the party in power successfully defended every incumbent Senate seat. That victory means [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=80.58s)]
*  that Democrats' Senate majority becomes stronger, giving them more room to act on judicial [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=87.22s)]
*  nominations and other executive appointments. And this coming week, the president will sign [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  into law legislation to give federal protections to same-sex and interracial marriages. That [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=97.38s)]
*  is no other way to say it. The man is on a roll, and he simply cannot be stopped. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=102.66s)]
*  And to paraphrase a former president, I wonder if Americans will get tired of all of this winning. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman-elect Jasmine Crockett of Texas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=114.41999999999999s)]
*  Congresswoman-elect, it's great to have you with us. Thank you for coming back on the show. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=118.5s)]
*  I guess I'll start by asking you that question. Are you, as a Democrat, tired of winning? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=123.78s)]
*  Talk about the president's streak here and what you think it means as you enter Congress next year. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  JASMINE CROCKETT, Texas, Republican Candidate, Texas, Republican Candidate, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=134.10000000000002s)]
*  I'll never get tired of winning. Hats off to the Biden administration. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=136.02s)]
*  Listen, there were so many people talking about this red wave that turned out to be a red dribble. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=140.34s)]
*  If we can even say that. I mean, think about it. We were dealing with a redistricting year, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=145.86s)]
*  and we still were able to come away with monumental wins. The fact that we are in the minority [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=151.78s)]
*  entering this next 118th term, you know what? It's barely a minority. And we know that the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=160.02s)]
*  Republicans are struggling right now. They won't even be able to function having 218. And I couldn't [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=167.38000000000002s)]
*  be more ecstatic. I think that the president still has some wins left this term. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  You were on this show with us before the midterms, and you warned Democrats to focus on, quote, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=181.3s)]
*  factual fears, things like abortion access and protecting our democracy, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=186.18s)]
*  while ignoring fake fears from Republicans, like attacks on trans children, for example. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=190.5s)]
*  Did the midterms prove your instincts right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=197.38s)]
*  Absolutely. When you saw the record turnout from Gen Zers, think about the things that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=200.9s)]
*  Gen Zers care about. They care about abortion access. They care about guns. Let's look at what [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  the president was able to do on guns. You didn't even mention that part. Literally, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  he just has so many wins. It's hard to keep up. And so I think that we were able to motivate [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=217.3s)]
*  a group of people that historically, people continuously say, young people don't vote. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, let me tell you, Gen Zers saved us this time. They absolutely voted. And it was because [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=228.74s)]
*  we focused in on the things that mattered. We focused on the substance. They paid attention, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=235.3s)]
*  and they were motivated. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=240.58s)]
*  This week, the House passed a bill ensuring federal protections for interracial and same-sex [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=243.78s)]
*  marriages that I mentioned there in the intro. It's already passed the Senate. President Biden [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=247.94000000000003s)]
*  expected to sign it this week or next week. Talk about the importance of the Respect for [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=252.58s)]
*  Marriage Act. What does it do? Highly symbolic, or does it actually also have something more than [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=257.3s)]
*  symbolism? Listen, you're implying that it was a mixed bag, and it really was. It was a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=262.58000000000004s)]
*  step in the right direction. It was exactly what I thought of when I went down to the Texas House, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=270.42s)]
*  and all of the senior members kept saying, incremental change. And it was one of those [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  things that was really hard for me to accept. Is this everything that we wanted? Is it everything [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=281.22s)]
*  that we should be entitled to in this country? Absolutely not. But was it a step in the right [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=287.06s)]
*  direction? Absolutely, especially after we saw that it's—or we saw what Clarence Thomas had to say [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=292.26s)]
*  in that terrible Dobbs opinion. We knew that more rights were on the chopping block, and so at least [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=299.7s)]
*  we're able to protect some of those rights. I just hope that we can get back to the rights that were [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=305.7s)]
*  under attack in Dobbs, the rights that we still are struggling with, and that's reproductive rights. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=311.78s)]
*  But this is absolutely a step in the right direction. Yeah, a step in the right direction [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=316.98s)]
*  and certainly an important step nonetheless. You were just elected as the freshman representative [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=321.86s)]
*  to Democratic leadership, a significant position. What does that mean to you? How do you plan on [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=327.3s)]
*  using that position to advance the things that you care about, the things that you're talking [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  about, and the things that matter to your constituents? Yeah, absolutely. So one of the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=337.38s)]
*  things—it was interesting because we literally just got back from Harvard. That was another part [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=342.1s)]
*  of our orientation, and we talked about who was voting for who and why. And one of the very [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=347.22s)]
*  interesting things that we learned is that overwhelmingly, if people actually were tuned in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=353.62s)]
*  and got the information, they supported the president at a range of about 20 percent more. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=360.02s)]
*  And so one of the things that we've really got to do is we've got to work on making sure we're [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=367.22s)]
*  getting the information out. So communication is important. Not everyone takes their information [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=371.22s)]
*  from MSNBC. I know that may be a surprise. But we know that people are on Twitter, they're on TikTok, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=376.82s)]
*  they're all over. And so we've got to make sure that we're communicating by sending letters, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=385.46s)]
*  by making sure that we're going and meeting people where they are, meeting them at church, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=390.26s)]
*  meeting them wherever we can, the grocery stores, literally yelling these wins from the top of our [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=394.74s)]
*  lungs, to make sure that people know, no matter if you're in rural America or if you're in urban [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=400.66s)]
*  America, the Democrats are fighting for you. If farmers want to make sure that there are farms [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=407.14000000000004s)]
*  that are left because climate change is causing such a problem, then they'll vote for Democrats. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=412.1s)]
*  It's just a matter of getting the message out to them. If you want to make sure that in rural [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=417.3s)]
*  America your hospitals aren't closing, you probably need to vote for the Democrats, the ones that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=421.3s)]
*  wanted to expand upon Medicaid access and make sure that your hospitals stay open. And so I think [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=426.66s)]
*  it's just about making sure that I use this position and emphasize the leadership that we [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=431.94s)]
*  need to communicate to everyone. We saw that in Georgia. Senator Warnock was not able just to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=437.3s)]
*  communicate with Atlanta Metro. He had to communicate to all of Georgia, as well as the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=444.1s)]
*  organizers. We saw what Black Voters Matter did. We saw what Stacey Abrams and her team did. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=449.86s)]
*  And so it's going to take a lot. But I want to do those things. I want to do the organizing on [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=455.53999999999996s)]
*  the ground. And I want to make sure that we're messaging out about the great things that we're [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=459.38s)]
*  doing. It is a team effort, no doubt about that. Representative Alag Jasmine Crockett, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  congratulations to you and thank you for making time for us. Look forward to speaking to you again [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=469.14s)]
*  in the weeks and months ahead. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=473.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deTW1latUB0&t=484.9s)]
