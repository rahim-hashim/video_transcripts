# Gold Star father Khizr Khan: 'I am disgusted' by Trump's Arlington stunt
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8)
*  Five-time draft dodger Donald Trump loves to paint himself as a champion for veterans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=0.0s)]
*  Nobody has ever defended the veterans like I have defended the veterans. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=6.32s)]
*  I took good care of our vets. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=11.08s)]
*  I will always honor our veterans. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=12.6s)]
*  We'll take care of our amazing veterans better than anybody. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=14.32s)]
*  So Trump's performative support for the military hit a new low this week when he went to Arlington [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=17.8s)]
*  National Cemetery to honor 13 fallen soldiers who died during the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=24.08s)]
*  As we now know, Trump used his visit to get political, filming an ad in which he jabbed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  President Biden with the headstones of fallen troops in the backdrop. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=37.0s)]
*  We can never assume why Trump does what he does, but we do know that it leads to disgraceful [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=42.28s)]
*  moments like the one we saw, which was, of course, another disgraceful moment that happened [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=48.72s)]
*  recently when Trump said that the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which honors civilians, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=53.68s)]
*  is, quote, actually much better than the Medal of Honor, which is awarded to service members [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=58.16s)]
*  who are wounded or killed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=63.56s)]
*  If Trump's Arlington stunt was an attempt at cleaning that up, he failed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=65.56s)]
*  As NPR first reported, cemetery officials tried to prevent Trump and his staffers from [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=70.4s)]
*  filming in an area known as Section 60 where veterans of recent wars are buried. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=75.36s)]
*  Arlington staff members are authorized to take photos there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=80.5s)]
*  Trump's campaign staff responded by verbally abusing and pushing aside one of those officials. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=84.1s)]
*  The Trump campaign denied physical violence took place, but campaign communications director [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=89.26s)]
*  Stephen Chung then insulted cemetery staff, claiming one of them suffered from a, quote, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=93.74s)]
*  mental health episode. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=99.02s)]
*  The ordeal prompted the U.S. Army to make a rare public rebuke, issuing a statement [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=100.9s)]
*  confirming the physical encounter took place, adding that the Trump campaign was, quote, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=105.34s)]
*  well aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DOD policies which clearly prohibit political [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=110.06s)]
*  activities on cemetery grounds. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=116.14s)]
*  Look, Trump's been caught plain and simple, and his blatant disrespect for the military [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=118.34s)]
*  is sadly nothing new, especially for veterans who criticize him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=122.56s)]
*  Case in point, the late Senator John McCain. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=127.18s)]
*  He's not a war hero. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=130.66s)]
*  He's a war hero. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=131.66s)]
*  He's a war hero. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=132.66s)]
*  Five and a half years into the beginning of camp. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=133.66s)]
*  He's a war hero because he was captured. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=134.66s)]
*  I like people that weren't captured, OK? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=136.38s)]
*  I hate to tell you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=138.02s)]
*  But then, of course, as president, you may remember reporting that Trump referred to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  fallen soldiers as, quote, losers and suckers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=143.46s)]
*  While Trump and his allies deny he said that, Trump's former chief of staff, retired U.S. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=147.34s)]
*  Marine Corps General John Kelly, confirmed Trump did say that, which led Trump to attack [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=151.94s)]
*  Kelly as he has many of his former cabinet members, such as the former defense secretary [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=158.02s)]
*  Jim Mattis and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Staff Mark Kelly, who Trump has accused [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=162.34s)]
*  a crime punishable by death. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=168.06s)]
*  And then there's what Trump would do if elected again, vowing to fire so-called woke generals. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=177.1s)]
*  Are you going to fire those generals, the woke generals at the top? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=178.1s)]
*  Because people have been talking about it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=182.34s)]
*  Yes, I would get rid of them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=183.34s)]
*  I'd fire them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=184.94s)]
*  I would fire them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=185.94s)]
*  You can't have woke military. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=186.94s)]
*  Now, when it comes to explaining his actions at Arlington, Trump's being Trump, of course, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=187.94s)]
*  deflecting accountability. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=194.18s)]
*  He started by claiming total ignorance in an interview with NBC's Dasha Burns. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=195.58s)]
*  And now it appears that he is actually pointing the finger at the families. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=199.52s)]
*  And all of a sudden, I hear that somebody that I have no idea who it is got into an [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=204.74s)]
*  argument with somebody else at the cemetery. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=208.68s)]
*  They said, sir, could you take some pictures with us at the graves of our child? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=210.86s)]
*  I didn't want to take pictures, but I wanted to take them if they wanted to take them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=217.18s)]
*  Aim at families of fallen veterans. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=222.34s)]
*  Nothing new for Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=226.62s)]
*  You remember in 2016 when Gold Star father Qazir Khan addressed the DNC blasting Trump's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=228.62s)]
*  attack on the Muslim community in a now powerful and prophetic speech. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=234.62s)]
*  Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=241.38s)]
*  Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending United States of America. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=245.3s)]
*  You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=253.94s)]
*  You have sacrificed nothing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=263.54s)]
*  And of course, how did Trump respond to that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=271.86s)]
*  She had nothing to say. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=275.74s)]
*  She probably maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=276.74s)]
*  You tell me. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=279.54s)]
*  Trump's allies piled on accusing Conn of using his fallen son as a political pawn, which [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=281.94s)]
*  makes what happened this week at Arlington all the more sickening. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  A disgraced former commander in chief standing on the graves of America's fallen to take [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=291.02000000000004s)]
*  what he knew was an illegal photo, all to score cheap political points. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=296.66s)]
*  Qazir Khan is a Gold Star father. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=301.94s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=304.22s)]
*  His late son, Homi Khan, served as the U.S. Army captain in Iraq. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=305.22s)]
*  Mr. Khan, thank you so much for coming back on the show. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=309.06s)]
*  It's good to see you again. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=311.62s)]
*  The Vice President Kamala Harris put out her own statement today condemning what happened [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=313.3s)]
*  at the Arlington Cemetery. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=318.42s)]
*  She said, quote, This is a man who is unable to comprehend anything other than service [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=320.06s)]
*  to himself. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=325.32s)]
*  You called out Trump's lack of sacrifices in your 2016 DNC speech, as we just highlighted [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=327.04s)]
*  there. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=333.44s)]
*  What do you make of this latest incident involving Trump at Arlington Cemetery? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=334.44s)]
*  Well, again, I am disgusted, but not surprised. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=339.4s)]
*  This is Trump that the world has known. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=346.98s)]
*  He has no concept of service and sacrifice, as you narrated multiple occasions when he [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=350.68s)]
*  was in office, how he disrespected our heroes and their families. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=361.54s)]
*  And he continues to be. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  What I am surprised is Republicans are as patriotic as anyone else. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=371.72s)]
*  How come they have not seen this contempt of our heroes, of our uniformed and our veterans [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=380.0s)]
*  and their families deep down in Trump and have rejected him? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  They have three presidential elections, Ayman. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=395.29999999999995s)]
*  Last three presidential elections, he has been, Trump had been Republican representative. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  It is amazing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=408.41999999999996s)]
*  It's a regrettable legacy that Republicans have created for themselves for such a despicable [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=410.4s)]
*  person that fails to respect the sacrifice and service. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=419.5s)]
*  So I am disgusted, but I'm not surprised from Trump. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=424.26s)]
*  It will continue to be like this. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=428.46s)]
*  That is what he is. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=430.66s)]
*  You bring up a very important point, Mr. Khan, about the Republican Party. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=431.96s)]
*  When you and your wife were targeted by Trump in 2016, there were a handful of Republicans [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=436.58s)]
*  who defended you, like the late Senator John McCain. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=441.66s)]
*  But when you look at the modern day Republican Party, they have all fallen in line with Trump's [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=445.34s)]
*  disrespect towards veterans and their families. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=449.98s)]
*  You have his running mate, J.D. Vance, defending Trump's visit. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=452.66s)]
*  Even Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas put the blame on everybody but Donald Trump. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=455.98s)]
*  This is a new low point for the Republican Party and the state of veterans in this country. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=461.64s)]
*  Ayman, I honor the service of both Senators Vance and Cotton and other veterans and their [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  families. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=477.32s)]
*  We honor their service. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=478.32s)]
*  To both of them, I say this, and please make a note of it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  In 234-year history of the United States, there had not been a president or former president [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=486.46000000000004s)]
*  who had been indicted and convicted of a felony, whereas Trump, their candidate, candidate [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=496.7s)]
*  of Vance and Cotton, is convicted of 34 felonies, lowest in the history of the United States. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=505.54s)]
*  This is a tragedy that is a legacy of shame in the history of the United States. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=520.9s)]
*  Veterans will continue to have this burden henceforth in history that they nominated [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=534.62s)]
*  a person who is convicted of 34 felonies as their candidate. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=542.74s)]
*  I want to ask you about something that you have a lot of experience with, and it also [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=548.7800000000001s)]
*  is in relation to this development at Arlington, this incident. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=552.4200000000001s)]
*  According to the New York Times, an official filed a report but then declined to press [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=556.4200000000001s)]
*  charges, the person believed to have been involved in that altercation. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=562.46s)]
*  Military officials later said that they feared the employee would face retaliation from Trump [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=567.02s)]
*  supporters if her identity was exposed and ultimately leaked online. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=572.66s)]
*  You have experience with this, unfortunately, as someone who was targeted by Trump and his [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=578.14s)]
*  allies. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=582.26s)]
*  How real of a threat is that? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=583.7s)]
*  How menacing of a problem are these threats to people who try to do the right thing in [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=585.34s)]
*  our society but then get attacked by Trump supporters? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=590.18s)]
*  I would testify to the courtesy and the professionalism of Arlington Cemetery staff. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=593.38s)]
*  They are most courteous and most cognizant of families and the heroes that are buried [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=605.62s)]
*  there. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=614.0999999999999s)]
*  I have had personally, our family has had many years of interaction with them. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=615.86s)]
*  They are most courteous, most professional, and all they were trying to do was enforce [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=622.2600000000001s)]
*  the regulation that is in place. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=628.7s)]
*  I am not surprised. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=632.1400000000001s)]
*  Their concern is justified. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=633.82s)]
*  But as a witness to their professionalism, professionalism of the Arlington Cemetery [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=637.1800000000001s)]
*  staff, their courtesy is amazingly impressive and they are always cognizant of why they [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=644.54s)]
*  are there, what honor they are protecting and they are guarding on behalf of all of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=652.8599999999999s)]
*  us. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=659.3s)]
*  So I am not surprised because of the concern of Trump's behavior. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=660.5799999999999s)]
*  Final question to you, Mr. Khan. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=666.18s)]
*  What do you say to military families, other military families like yours, who see what [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=667.9399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is doing and yet support him anyway? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=672.9s)]
*  Don't be suckered in. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  He has shown his true colors in 2018 in France when he called our heroes as suckers and losers. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=679.9399999999999s)]
*  And then standing in the same Section 60, he asked General Kelly, where his young son [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=690.9399999999999s)]
*  is buried, asked them what is in it for them. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=697.66s)]
*  This person has no concept of sacrifice and no concept of service to this nation. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=701.18s)]
*  And more important, to all America, I ask, will you hire a person with this racket of [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=709.18s)]
*  felony conviction to guard your family? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=718.7399999999999s)]
*  Same thing to our veterans and their families that you have served this country with honor [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=722.8599999999999s)]
*  and dignity continue to serve. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=729.6999999999999s)]
*  One more time, make sure that Donald Trump, as his own attorney general said, Bill Barr [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=733.18s)]
*  said in a public statement that Donald Trump should not be elected president again. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=740.0999999999999s)]
*  He's a narcissist, troubled man. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=745.62s)]
*  How true. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=749.18s)]
*  Mr. Khazir Khan, thank you so much for your time. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=750.18s)]
*  It bothers me to always around these types of moments and incidents, but I'm so glad [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=754.5s)]
*  for your insights and for sharing your thoughts with us. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodoCeF_Yq8&t=758.7800000000001s)]
