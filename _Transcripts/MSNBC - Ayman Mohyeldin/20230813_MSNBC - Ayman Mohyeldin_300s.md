# Donald Trump is 'playing with fire' in election interference case
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg)
*  And we begin with that breaking news out of Georgia this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=0.0s)]
*  Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis will begin presenting her election interference [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=5.4s)]
*  case against Donald Trump and his allies to a grand jury early next week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=10.38s)]
*  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is reporting the timeline came into sharper focus when [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=14.44s)]
*  former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan and independent journalist George Sheedy separately [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=19.98s)]
*  confirmed that they received notifications they will testify on Tuesday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=24.98s)]
*  Now this means the public might know by Tuesday whether jurors indict the ex-president and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=29.72s)]
*  others Tuesday evening to be specific. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=35.76s)]
*  Willis is expected to begin her presentation to grand jurors on Monday. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=38.24s)]
*  We're going to have more on this breaking development later in the show. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=41.64s)]
*  But we first begin with a reality check for the now thrice indicted ex-president. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump quote is a criminal defendant. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=52.16s)]
*  He is going to have restrictions like any other criminal defendant. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Those were the words of Judge Tanya Chutkin, the federal judge overseeing special counsel [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=58.24s)]
*  Jack Smith's election interference case against Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=63.52s)]
*  In a hearing yesterday, she rejected Trump's request to be able to speak more broadly and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=66.8s)]
*  publicly about the investigation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=71.12s)]
*  In a new protective order, Chutkin limited the ex-president and his attorneys from publicly [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=73.84s)]
*  discussing any quote sensitive material turned over to them during the discovery process. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=78.7s)]
*  And that includes quote any personally identifying information concerning witnesses, information [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=84.92s)]
*  that had emerged from the grand jury and any materials turned over from other government [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=91.44s)]
*  entities. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=96.94s)]
*  During that hearing, Trump's legal team argued that too strict of a protective order would [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  stifle the candidate's constitutional rights. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=102.76s)]
*  But Judge Chutkin, well, she basically shot that down. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=105.44s)]
*  Quote Mr. Trump, like every American has a first amendment right to free speech. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=110.08s)]
*  But that right is not absolute. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=114.6s)]
*  It is an early blow to what is largely expected to be the centerpiece of Trump's defense during [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=117.36s)]
*  trial since this latest indictment dropped the GOP front runner and his allies. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=121.76s)]
*  Well, they've kind of been making the rounds and they've been arguing that the government's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=126.4s)]
*  entire case is simply nothing more than a brazen attack on Trump's first amendment political [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=130.4s)]
*  speech. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=136.12s)]
*  This is a free speech killing indictment, killing free speech. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=138.16s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=142.56s)]
*  I apologize in speech for this reason. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=143.76s)]
*  What the president saw in the 2020 election was all these irregularities going on. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=145.32s)]
*  He had every right to comment on that and act politically. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=149.16s)]
*  You're entitled to question whether it was honest or not. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=152.44s)]
*  That's the uniqueness of the first amendment. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=155.76s)]
*  That's the uniqueness of America. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=158.12s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  You shouldn't be prosecuted for your thoughts. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=162.96s)]
*  So here's the thing with that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=163.96s)]
*  According to Legal Express, that's not actually a defense that holds any water. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=165.44s)]
*  Legal experts say there is little legal merit to that argument, particularly since the breadth [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=170.36s)]
*  of steps taken by the ex-president and his allies to overturn the election transformed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  mere speech into action. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=181.06s)]
*  I mean, Trump isn't being indicted for what he said about the 2020 election. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  He's actually being indicted for what he did, allegedly engaging in a criminal conspiracy [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  to overturn the will of American voters. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=194.72000000000003s)]
*  But Trump's first amendment fallacy isn't just a shaky defense in the courtroom. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=197.8s)]
*  There's actually growing risk that his refusal to remain silent could derail candidate Trump. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=201.84s)]
*  And all this could be before he even gets to hit the campaign trail in earnest. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  Earlier this week, prosecutors from the special counsel's office put forward a proposed trial [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=211.24s)]
*  date landing on January 2nd. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  However, during Friday's hearing, Judge Chutkin cautioned that the more either party makes [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=218.36s)]
*  quote, inflammatory statements about the case, the greater her urgency will be to speed [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=223.42s)]
*  up the trial date. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  The judge warned that even quote, arguably ambiguous statements could be construed as [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=230.06s)]
*  intimidation or harassment of potential witnesses. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=234.89999999999998s)]
*  Judge Chutkin ended the hearing with this promise, quote, I will take whatever measures [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=239.22s)]
*  are necessary to safeguard the integrity of the case. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=244.7s)]
*  So there you have it, plain and simple. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  Judge Chutkin has laid it out in black and white, the exact parameters by which Trump [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=252.14s)]
*  must abide, which leaves us with this question. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  Will the ex-president actually listen? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=260.86s)]
*  Will the judge's warnings fall on deaf ears? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=263.46s)]
*  Right now, Donald Trump is playing with fire and with every new speech or social media [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=267.06s)]
*  post he makes, he runs a risk of getting burned. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRZipylaXg&t=271.09999999999997s)]
