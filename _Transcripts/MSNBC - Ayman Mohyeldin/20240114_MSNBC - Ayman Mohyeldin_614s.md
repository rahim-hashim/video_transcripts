# Gaza journalist Wael Al Dahdouh to Pres. Biden: listen to both sides, not just one
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA)
*  Wael, Dahdouh joins us now from Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=0.0s)]
*  Wael, it's great to have you with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  I think so many people who have heard about the incredible loss that you have endured [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  and experienced wonder, how do you get up every day? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=11.94s)]
*  How do you keep reporting and working the next day? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  By the grace of God, with the help of God and the support of God, this is definitely [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=19.18s)]
*  not an easy situation to endure because the loss was huge and the pain and the suffering [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=24.22s)]
*  is even bigger and the cost is very high. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=29.72s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we ask ourselves, what is the other option? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=33.0s)]
*  We sit in our homes waiting for missiles to land, leave this job, give up this humanitarian [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=36.92s)]
*  message that we delivered. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=42.26s)]
*  This is definitely not an option, at least in our dictionary and according to our convictions, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=44.28s)]
*  because I am 100% sure that I am carrying a noble, holy humanitarian message that all [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=49.8s)]
*  of the international laws and conventions, all the humanitarian norms guarantee. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=55.8s)]
*  And I'm also convinced that I do my job accordingly to the highest professional standards. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=61.64s)]
*  Everybody sees that on our screen, most of what we do is carried out live. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=67.16s)]
*  So therefore, we do not have anything to hide. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=71.94s)]
*  My family, my wife, my son Mahmoud, my daughter Sham, my grandson Adam, my firstborn Hamza, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=74.92s)]
*  all these have been through a lot for a quarter of a century because of my difficult job. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=82.88s)]
*  I do this difficult job in the Gaza Strip, this hot spot. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  They have sacrificed a lot. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=92.84s)]
*  They hardly saw me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=94.66s)]
*  Maybe I did not perform my duty as a father of a family because of having to do this holy [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=96.16s)]
*  job under this novel humanitarian mission. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=101.16s)]
*  They got used to that and they suffered. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=105.0s)]
*  This is a very big sacrifice they made. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  And they made that sacrifice to enable me to continue my job to the best of my ability [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=110.46s)]
*  and to carry out this task and this job in a way which is compatible to the holy nature [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=115.46s)]
*  of this work. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=120.61999999999999s)]
*  So when the time comes and their blood sheds and their lives are sacrificed, I should leave [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=122.05999999999999s)]
*  them and give up this job? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=126.44s)]
*  Never. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=128.42s)]
*  It was incumbent on me to be faithful to the blood of my wife, the partner of my life and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=129.42s)]
*  my son who had to play the role of father and an older brother and my son Mahmoud who [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=134.34s)]
*  was attending an American school and preparing to be a journalist who speaks English and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=139.78s)]
*  Sham, who was the apple of my eye, the flower of my household. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=144.26s)]
*  She entered school and my grandson, who was not more than six months and 14 members of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=148.5s)]
*  my family, my cousins who died at the same time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=152.66s)]
*  All of this made it incumbent on me to be faithful to them when their blood was dead [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=156.5s)]
*  because they made the sacrifice. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=160.86s)]
*  Maybe for all these reasons, I can continue. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=163.06s)]
*  Do you believe, Wa'el, that your reporting is actually making a difference in this current [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=165.68s)]
*  war? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=170.68s)]
*  I try to do my job to the best of my ability, to the best of my strengths in the utmost [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=171.68s)]
*  professional way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  And maybe this will make a difference. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=177.8s)]
*  And for this reason, maybe the reports do make a difference and do have an effect because [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  credibility is important. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  The confidence, the trust is important. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  And the viewers and the audience understands that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=188.96s)]
*  This is what's important for me to do my job to the best of my ability and to make absolutely [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=191.58s)]
*  certain that I follow the highest standards of professionalism. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  And I look for the truth without underestimating or overestimating, without falsifying and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=200.10000000000002s)]
*  to search for the truth. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=206.38000000000002s)]
*  Because ultimately what happens in Gaza is big. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  It's very big. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=210.86s)]
*  This is a hotspot. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=211.94s)]
*  So therefore, there is no need to blow things out of proportion, exaggerate or falsify or [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=213.66000000000003s)]
*  provide fake news. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  On the contrary, to present the naked facts as they are and to stick to the highest norms [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=220.8s)]
*  of professionalism. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=225.68s)]
*  This is what will make our stories reach the hearts of the audiences, not on their minds [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=227.24s)]
*  only. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, we're trying to convey what's happening. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=233.08s)]
*  We are just a link between what's happening on the ground and the audience throughout [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=239.66000000000003s)]
*  I did not use this platform, this respectful platform, as a platform for revenge, even [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  though it was a personal thing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=246.46s)]
*  And the pain was more than what I could bear. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=248.74s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I came back carrying out my tasks and job. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=251.78s)]
*  Wad, I wanted to ask you specifically about something, which is that the international [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=256.48s)]
*  community of journalists, you know, they've always stood up for each other around the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=260.6s)]
*  world, defended the freedom of the press. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=264.3s)]
*  Do you and the other Palestinian journalists in Gaza right now, do you feel you are getting [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=267.36s)]
*  the support you need from Western journalists or press organizations around the world? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=273.02s)]
*  Unfortunately, we feel that there is some degree of solidarity, support and help. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=278.96s)]
*  But from our point of view, at least, and because it's us who are paying this painful [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  price, we do not feel that support is enough, is sufficient, or amounts to the level of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=287.46s)]
*  the high costs we are paying. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=292.5s)]
*  I told you a little while ago that one hundred and six Palestinian journalists have become [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=294.34s)]
*  martyrs as a result of Israeli attacks in less than three months. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=298.14s)]
*  This is frightening and has never happened in other wars, which lasted 20 years, maybe, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=302.42s)]
*  according to my knowledge. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=306.98s)]
*  Yet what happened vis-a-vis those events? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=308.3s)]
*  Maybe a statement here, a statement there, some efforts, nothing more. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=311.42s)]
*  This pains us, actually. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=315.74s)]
*  Many Palestinian journalists feel that they were let down, left alone to face this massacre [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=317.66s)]
*  in this carnage. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=322.42s)]
*  And the world did not look at the bigger picture, did not really stand by us as we would have [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=323.86s)]
*  liked. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=328.58000000000004s)]
*  We feel that we are being killed twice, once by the bombs and once by this silence, this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  shy way of expressing support. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=335.3s)]
*  Let me, if I can, ask you about what you're hearing on the ground from Palestinians in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=337.94s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=344.86s)]
*  You speak to them every day. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=346.14s)]
*  You speak to them a lot more than any of the Western journalists that are reporting on [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=347.46s)]
*  this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=352.18s)]
*  What are the people of Gaza telling you about the war, about what they want to happen after [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=353.18s)]
*  this war ends, about Palestinian factions, including Hamas, in the future of Gaza? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=357.82000000000005s)]
*  People here are paying a heavy price, a heavy cost, their blood, their children, their lives, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  their houses have been destroyed. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=369.54s)]
*  More than two thirds of the Palestinian people are in a state of forceful expulsion. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=371.42s)]
*  The bloodshed continues every day, the fighting, the bombardment. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  Definitely, this is not a life for people. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=380.14000000000004s)]
*  People do not want this to happen. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=383.36s)]
*  This is normal. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=385.70000000000005s)]
*  This is natural. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=386.74s)]
*  The Palestinian people are not any different than any other people on earth. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  They love life. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=392.18s)]
*  They love living life. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=393.46s)]
*  They love to live like anybody else, to travel when they want to and to come back home when [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=395.5s)]
*  they want, to build when they want, to rebuild when they want, to live amongst their kids [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=400.42s)]
*  and kin instead of living in a diaspora. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=406.02s)]
*  These are the kinds of things that people love. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=409.58s)]
*  And our people are not an exception to this and not any different. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=412.0s)]
*  We want to live. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=415.66s)]
*  Our people want to live in peace. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=416.74s)]
*  But definitely, with the continuation of the occupation, this is very, very difficult. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=419.14000000000004s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=424.54s)]
*  In a few years, our generations have had to go through five wars and in between many years [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  of escalation. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=430.5s)]
*  For education, for example, people who want to travel to further their studies, they can't. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=431.90000000000003s)]
*  People who want to travel to get medical treatment, they cannot do that as freely as other people. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=437.22s)]
*  Everybody should be able to make the decision to travel whenever you want, to wherever you [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=443.38s)]
*  want to go, to go on holiday or vacation, except for the Palestinian people in Gaza. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=447.06s)]
*  And this is very painful. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=452.76s)]
*  This is a very high cost. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=453.76s)]
*  Many generations have to live through these severe conditions. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=455.7s)]
*  What do you expect from people? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=460.14s)]
*  Nobody likes war and people know the high cost of war. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=462.42s)]
*  But when you squeeze them in the corner and say to them, what do you feel about war? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=465.34000000000003s)]
*  This is definitely not fair. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=470.54s)]
*  Nobody wants this war to end today, before tomorrow. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=472.82s)]
*  But at the end of the day, this is not their choice. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=476.06s)]
*  This is not their decision. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  This is not in their hands. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=480.46s)]
*  Let me ask you, Wael, finally, and I want to ask you a question maybe not as a journalist, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=482.34s)]
*  but as a father, as a grandfather, as a husband who has lost so much to Israeli bombs supplied [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=486.94s)]
*  and paid for by American taxpayers. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=494.36s)]
*  What is your message to the American people and perhaps President Biden, who may be watching [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=498.26s)]
*  this interview? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=503.38s)]
*  This is a huge injustice that the Palestinian people are subjected to. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=504.9s)]
*  The Palestinian families are subjected to. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=508.94s)]
*  The Palestinian children subjected to. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=511.5s)]
*  The Palestinian women are subjected to. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=513.9399999999999s)]
*  People with special needs in Palestine are subjected to. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=516.8199999999999s)]
*  So therefore, it's incumbent on President Biden being the president of the most powerful [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=520.06s)]
*  state in the world, who can impose many things. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=524.7s)]
*  It's incumbent upon him to look with his own eyes at what's happening. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=527.98s)]
*  What's happening here deserves to be looked at in detail and seriously and transparently. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  And he should listen to both sides of the narrative, not just one side. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=537.78s)]
*  It's the right of the Palestinian people. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=541.2s)]
*  It's my right as a father who was pained, who paid with the blood of his family, to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=543.5s)]
*  speak out about how I feel. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=547.5s)]
*  I paid a very high cost for the weapons which targeted where my family was and destroys [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=549.54s)]
*  it, levels it to the ground without prior warning. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=554.4200000000001s)]
*  I guess my family and many other families. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=557.3399999999999s)]
*  This is a huge injustice. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=559.9s)]
*  This is a huge transgression. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=561.66s)]
*  Nobody can bear that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=563.8199999999999s)]
*  I demand from the American president, I advise the president, to look at what's happening, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  to listen to what people, ordinary people, who are paying the cost. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=570.54s)]
*  And they have every right to secure their rights as human beings, as partners in humanity. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=575.02s)]
*  Nothing more, nothing less. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=579.8599999999999s)]
*  Wa'al Ad-Dahduh, the bureau chief of Al Jazeera Arabic in Gaza. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=582.0999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time and for all of your insights. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=585.8s)]
*  I greatly appreciate you spending time with us this evening. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=589.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RGhVZEBFuA&t=592.76s)]
