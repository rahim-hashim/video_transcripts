# Rep. Robert Garcia predicts Pete Hegseth 'won't even make it to the actual confirmation process'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA)
*  I know the best people. I know the best managers. I know the best deal makers. I know people that will make us so strong. I know guys that are so good. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=0.0s)]
*  That was then presidential candidate Donald Trump back in 2015, boasting that he would only hire the best people as president. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=12.0s)]
*  Now, after winning the presidency a second time, he is facing tremendous fallout over his pick to lead the Pentagon. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=22.0s)]
*  Former Fox News host Pete Hexeth. Hexeth faces an uphill confirmation battle for defense secretary as he is bogged down by scandal after scandal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=28.0s)]
*  This week, a new bombshell report from The New Yorker alleged that he was forced to step down from two veteran nonprofit groups, Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=38.0s)]
*  Amid accusations, including a whistleblower report by former employees of one of their groups to their managers of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety and other disqualifying behavior. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=50.0s)]
*  Including allegations that Hexeth, who was married at the time and other members of his management team, sexually pursued the organization's female staffers, whom they divided into two groups, the party girls and the non-party girls. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=63.0s)]
*  The report also alleges that under Hexeth's leadership, Veterans for Freedom ran up enormous debt and financial records indicate that by the end of 2008, it was unable to pay its creditors. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=78.0s)]
*  NBC News has not seen the whistleblower report or the letter of complaint cited by The New Yorker. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=91.0s)]
*  After a request for comment, Hexeth's lawyer referred NBC News to a statement it provided to The New York Times in which an unidentified Hexeth advisor called the claims outlandish. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=98.0s)]
*  Now Hexeth's behavior at Fox News has also come under scrutiny. Ten current and former Fox News employees told NBC News that he drank in ways that actually concerned his colleagues. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=110.0s)]
*  Two of those Fox News employees said that on more than a dozen occasion, occasions during Hexeth's time as co-host on Fox and Friends weekend, they smelled alcohol on him before he went on the air. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=121.0s)]
*  Spokesperson for the Trump transition team has called the allegations unfounded and false. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=133.0s)]
*  Fox News did not respond to requests for comment, but Hexeth said this week that he doesn't have a drinking problem. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=138.0s)]
*  Now this pileup of controversy could put his nomination in jeopardy even among Republicans. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=146.0s)]
*  Here's what Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa said earlier today about Hexeth to my colleague Courtney Qubee. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=151.0s)]
*  Of course, Trump is still standing by Hexeth, though posting on Truth Social Pete is a winner and there is nothing that can be done to change that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=175.0s)]
*  Hexeth isn't the only Trump pick in peril. There's also the matter of Tulsi Gabbard, his choice for director of national intelligence. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=185.0s)]
*  The polarizing Democrat turned Republican has sparked bipartisan concern on Capitol Hill due to her foreign policy views, particularly her views on Syria. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=192.0s)]
*  During her tenure in Congress, both Democratic and Republican aides were concerned Gabbard would leak information on a Syrian defector to someone associated with Bashar al-Assad's government, who Gabbard met with in an unannounced trip in 2017. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=201.0s)]
*  Gabbard's friendly rhetoric towards Russia has even set off alarm bells for her own staff. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=216.0s)]
*  According to ABC News, three former aides said that Gabbard regularly read and shared articles from the Russian news site RT, formerly known as Russia Today, which of course the U.S. intelligence community characterized in 2017 as the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=221.0s)]
*  When asked for comment by ABC News, the Trump transition team dismissed the report as false. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=238.0s)]
*  Now Gabbard's policy views on Syria and Russia have prompted a group of nearly 100 former security officials to urge the Senate to carefully scrutinize her nomination. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=244.0s)]
*  And then of course, there is this guy, Cash Patel, Trump's controversial pick to run the FBI, who has made no secret of his desire to go after Trump's political enemies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=254.0s)]
*  But while Patel's nomination has been celebrated by Trump and his base, he reportedly has gotten a lukewarm reception from Senate Republicans, with several who have not yet committed to voting yes on him. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=263.0s)]
*  This all comes just as, you know, Trump's pick for attorney general, former far-right congressman Matt Gaetz, was forced to withdraw from consideration a few weeks ago, and it was clear he did not have the votes from Senate Republicans. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=275.0s)]
*  Trump and Republicans got the best outcome they could have possibly asked for by securing the White House, flipping the U.S. Senate and holding on to the House. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=288.0s)]
*  And yet, the president-elect's picks are so divisive that he cannot even get members of his own party to commit to voting for them. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=297.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia of California. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=306.0s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to have you here in person and to see you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=310.0s)]
*  Let me get your reaction to all of this that's playing out with the president-elect's nominations, but more importantly, his defense secretary. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=313.0s)]
*  And I want to play for you just a clip from the president-elect's interview with my colleague, Kristen Welkert, it's going to air tomorrow on Meet the Press. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=320.0s)]
*  But here's what he had to say about his defense secretary nominee. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=326.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=330.0s)]
*  It looks like Peter's doing well now. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=332.0s)]
*  I mean, people were a little bit concerned. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=336.0s)]
*  He's a young guy with a tremendous track record, actually. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=338.0s)]
*  He went to Princeton and went to Harvard. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=343.0s)]
*  He was a good student at both, but he loves the military. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=345.0s)]
*  And I think people are starting to see it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=348.0s)]
*  So we'll be working on his nomination along with a lot of others. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=350.0s)]
*  Since you bring him up, do you still have confidence in Pete Hexson? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=354.0s)]
*  Yes, I do. I really do. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=357.0s)]
*  He's a very smart guy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=359.0s)]
*  I've known him through Fox, but I've known him for a long time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=360.0s)]
*  And he's basically a military guy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=364.0s)]
*  I mean, every time I talk to him, all he wants to talk about is the military. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=366.0s)]
*  He's a military guy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=369.0s)]
*  Have you gotten assurances from senators that he's going to be confirmed? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=370.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=374.0s)]
*  Do you think he can make it? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=375.0s)]
*  No. I think he will, yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=376.0s)]
*  I've had a lot of senators call me up saying he's fantastic. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=377.0s)]
*  You don't drink yourself. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=382.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=384.0s)]
*  You've talked about how devastating drinking can be. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=385.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=389.0s)]
*  How concerned are you that the person who you picked for this top job at the Defense Department, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=390.0s)]
*  at least according to those who've worked with him, has struggled with drinking? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=395.0s)]
*  But I've spoken to people that know him very well, and they say he does not have a drinking problem. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=400.0s)]
*  Your thoughts on that whole exchange? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=405.0s)]
*  First of all, do you share his confidence that Hexseth, Pete Hexseth, will get confirmed by the Senate? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=409.0s)]
*  And also just the way that he's talking about the fact that he's spoken to people who know him that say that he doesn't have a drinking problem. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=416.0s)]
*  Why don't you talk to him and find out for yourself whether or not he has a drinking problem? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=421.0s)]
*  I didn't get a lot of confidence out of Donald Trump there. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=425.0s)]
*  I mean, I think first of all, it's really clear that I'm not even convinced he's going to make it to the actual confirmation process. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=428.0s)]
*  I think that more and more comes out every day. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=434.0s)]
*  I mean, the email from the mother, reports from his Fox colleagues. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=436.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is not even vetting people or have them go through an FBI check, the very basics for confirmation for all his nominees. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=440.0s)]
*  He is unqualified to lead the government's largest department to the Defense Department. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=447.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, crazy pick. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=452.0s)]
*  RFK, insane nomination. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=454.0s)]
*  These are people that have no business being in the government and in fact are probably put there to destroy our agencies. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=457.0s)]
*  Speaking of how Republicans are responding to this, I'll get your thoughts to people like Chip Roy and Mike Johnson. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=464.0s)]
*  Chip Roy dismissed the allegations against Hexeth. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=470.0s)]
*  He called them indiscretions, his words, not mine. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=473.0s)]
*  And then this is what Mike Johnson had to say about Hexeth on Fox. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=477.0s)]
*  Seems like the momentum moving the right way. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=481.0s)]
*  Look, I like how he's approached it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=484.0s)]
*  We've all made mistakes in our lives, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=486.0s)]
*  But we believe in redemption. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=488.0s)]
*  We believe in redemption. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=490.0s)]
*  What an interesting time to have redemption when you're being asked to lead an agency that has 3 million people under your leadership, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=492.0s)]
*  almost a trillion dollar budget, making decisions about sending men and women into harm's way. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=499.0s)]
*  We're talking about war and peace. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=505.0s)]
*  We're talking about the largest department in the federal government. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=507.0s)]
*  He has no experience running anything. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=510.0s)]
*  He's been a Fox News commentator, which is fine, but to just pluck him out of nowhere with all of this baggage, all this history is so irresponsible. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=513.0s)]
*  I didn't get a lot of confidence out of Donald Trump in that clip he showed. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=521.0s)]
*  I hope he does not make the confirmation. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=524.0s)]
*  And if he does, they should essentially not confirm him. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=526.0s)]
*  He's not, he has no qualifications for the job. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=529.0s)]
*  But what does it say more about the way this incoming administration right now is kind of being run? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=532.0s)]
*  Because we're getting some initial reports that it's kind of like Game of Thrones in there right now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=538.0s)]
*  And I'll share with you this NBC News reporting that there's, you know, as you expect in any kind of new incoming administration, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=541.0s)]
*  forces vying for power. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=548.0s)]
*  You've got Donald Trump Jr. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=549.0s)]
*  and Eric Trump basically competing for power with the chief of staff, Suzy Wiles. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=551.0s)]
*  And this is, according to a source, NBC News spoke to us like Game of Thrones over there. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=558.0s)]
*  I think Don Jr. has been trying to do things at times. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=562.0s)]
*  It's like Suzy will have a meeting and then Don Jr. will say something else. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=564.0s)]
*  You know, what do you make of this? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=568.0s)]
*  We're not even barely a month into this thing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=571.0s)]
*  And don't forget Elon Musk. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=573.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=574.0s)]
*  You have Elon Musk flying around following Donald Trump wherever he goes. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=575.0s)]
*  You follow him to Paris, to France. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=579.0s)]
*  And so I think this is obviously, I mean, it's pretty clear that Donald Trump again is going to have a reckless presidency. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=582.0s)]
*  The fact that he's handing over Elon Musk, essentially the keys to the federal government to somehow destroy our institutions [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=588.0s)]
*  through some department that is a fake department he's creating out of nowhere just shows how irresponsible he is with the seriousness of the moment. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=595.0s)]
*  So he's not focused on actually helping people. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=602.0s)]
*  He's focused on taking away benefits that people depend on. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=604.0s)]
*  Social Security, Medicare, Department of Education. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=608.0s)]
*  These are things that he and folks like Elon Musk and the billionaire friends are trying to roll back. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=611.0s)]
*  And we've got to fight back really, really hard against Trump. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=616.0s)]
*  And quite frankly, these new billionaires are in charge of the government. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=619.0s)]
*  Yeah. So let me ask you about how you do fight back because as we just laid out, you obviously Republicans have control of the Senate, the White House, Congress. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=622.0s)]
*  They certainly have a lot of momentum in the courts as well. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=629.0s)]
*  What is it that people like yourself, Democratic leadership members of the House, are going to do, ordinary Americans can do, when they see these institutions come under threat? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=632.0s)]
*  Well, what you don't do is pledge to work with them. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=641.0s)]
*  I think that this idea that we're somehow going to work with Elon Musk and Donald Trump in some sort of bipartisanship way to make the country better, they have no interest in making the country better. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=644.0s)]
*  Their idea of working together with Democrats is steamrolling any sort of progress that we have made. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=655.0s)]
*  And so I think and a lot of younger members believe that we have got to be in the fight. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=660.0s)]
*  We've got to fight every single day, call them out. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=664.0s)]
*  Look, the last Congress, we were in the minority. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=667.0s)]
*  We still pushed back against a lot of terrible ideas. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=669.0s)]
*  And so those of us, especially, for example, myself and others that are on the Oversight Committee, we've got to investigate the Republicans. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=672.0s)]
*  We've got to investigate and making sure that Elon Musk is not taking away people's hard earned benefits. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=678.0s)]
*  And we've got to be tough. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=683.0s)]
*  We cannot just roll back and think this is going to be a Kumbaya moment. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=684.0s)]
*  This is a moment we've got to fight like hell for our rights and essentially for the government that provides people with so many important services. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=687.0s)]
*  It's going to be a long four years. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=694.0s)]
*  Congressman Robert Garcia, thank you so much. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=695.0s)]
*  Greatly appreciate it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=697.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=698.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG31xcCrbhA&t=717.0s)]
