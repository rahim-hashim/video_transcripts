# Political Theater, “Candidate Quality” Signal Trouble For Republicans Come November
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY)
*  All right, so on Saturday morning, 50 migrants, including a one-month-old baby, arrived outside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=8.08s)]
*  These men, women, and children, originally from Venezuela, are part of a disgraceful, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=11.48s)]
*  inhumane act of political theater being carried out by Republican governors. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=16.44s)]
*  And later in the show, we're going to continue our coverage of these officials' horrendous [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=20.88s)]
*  treatment of asylum seekers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  But we bring it up now because we want to point out that while their treatment is cruel, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=27.38s)]
*  it's also a distraction. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=32.26s)]
*  And you might be asking from what? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=34.26s)]
*  Well, a new NBC News poll out just this morning could give us a little bit of insight into [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=35.739999999999995s)]
*  this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=39.62s)]
*  Democrats have now pulled even within Republicans on the generic congressional midterm ballot, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=40.62s)]
*  with both parties locking in support from 46 percent of voters. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  Now, being in a dead heat isn't typical in an off-year election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=48.86s)]
*  But Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell actually saw this coming. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=52.9s)]
*  In fact, last month, he downplayed his own party's chances of flipping the Senate, citing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=56.46s)]
*  issues with, quote, candidate quality. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  And last week, the field of subpar candidates added yet another name to its roster when [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=64.18s)]
*  Dan Bolduc won New Hampshire's Republican U.S. Senate nomination. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=68.78s)]
*  Bolduc, a retired Army general, is a noted conspiracy theorist who champions Trump's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=72.66s)]
*  election lies. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=77.78s)]
*  And last year, he referred to his state's own Republican governor as a, quote, Chinese [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=78.78s)]
*  communist sympathizer. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=83.7s)]
*  Bolduc has styled himself as a political outsider, a self-proclaimed maverick in the mold of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=86.86s)]
*  John McCain. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=91.62s)]
*  Well, let's be honest here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=92.62s)]
*  If John McCain, as a child, had been dropped on his head and into a vat of acid. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=94.62s)]
*  Now, you see why Republican governors are trying to change the conversation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=99.02s)]
*  Mitch McConnell knows that candidate quality really does matter, even when the political [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=103.62s)]
*  wins should be in his party's favor. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=108.58s)]
*  Look at the 2010 and 2012 election cycles. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=111.38s)]
*  Maybe you remember Delaware Republican Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell, who, after [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=114.46s)]
*  confessing she, quote, dabbled in witchcraft, had to air a campaign ad declaring she was [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=117.74s)]
*  not a witch. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=123.78s)]
*  Or Missouri Republican Todd Akin, whose lead in the polls came to a screeching halt when [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  he said there was, quote, legitimate forms of rape. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=130.4s)]
*  In 2010, when House Democrats got walloped and lost dozens of seats, McConnell and his [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  candidates couldn't win the Senate for Republicans, and they couldn't do it in 2012 either. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=138.92s)]
*  Mitch McConnell knows political losers when he sees them, and it's clear he doesn't have [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=143.38s)]
*  a lot of hope for his crop of contenders this year. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=148.22s)]
*  Joining us now is former Democratic Congressman Max Rose of New York. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=152.18s)]
*  He is running to retake New York's 11th congressional district. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=154.9s)]
*  He joins me live. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=158.04s)]
*  Former congressman, it's great to see you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=159.9s)]
*  It's good to see you again. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=160.9s)]
*  Great to see you back in the fight to reclaim this district. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=161.9s)]
*  I think people are excited to see you run in this race. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=164.02s)]
*  Before we get into the specifics of your district, I want to play for you and get your reaction [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=168.46s)]
*  to something we heard from Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  Take a listen to this and I'll get your reaction to it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=175.18s)]
*  I'm pro-life, even in an election year. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  And to those who suggest that being pro-life is losing politics, I reject that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=181.22000000000003s)]
*  If you know anything about me, Shannon, for 20 years I've been supporting federal legislation [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  banning late-term abortions. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=191.86s)]
*  But you said there are states that make these decisions. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  The states, here's what Dobbs says, elected officials can make the decisions, state or [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=196.14000000000001s)]
*  federal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm not inconsistent. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  So the reason why we brought that up is because obviously abortion has become front and center [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=205.34s)]
*  on everyone's mind. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=208.44s)]
*  It has become a huge motivating factor for a lot of the voters that are turning out in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=209.66s)]
*  some of these special elections. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=214.1s)]
*  I want to hear from you what you think, what do you think about this issue and how it's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=215.18s)]
*  playing from the voters you're speaking to? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=220.1s)]
*  Well, first of all, as it pertains to Lindsey Graham, he's an extremist. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=221.94s)]
*  But Lindsey Graham is only part of the issue here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=225.62s)]
*  Look at the actions of his Republican colleagues in both the Senate and the House. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=228.7s)]
*  So few of them, in fact you can barely name a couple, have been willing to come out and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=235.1s)]
*  say they do not support Graham's bill. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=240.01999999999998s)]
*  So this is not the Lindsey Graham bill for a nationwide abortion ban. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=242.66s)]
*  This is the extremist national Republican bill for a nationwide abortion ban. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=247.3s)]
*  A mere few weeks ago they were saying, well, look, look, this is just a states' rights [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=252.06s)]
*  issue. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  We all knew that there was a deeper held belief in and around, even in cases of rape and incest, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=258.66s)]
*  even in cases of the life of the mother, the life of the child, that they would not support [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=265.5s)]
*  this. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  So it's horrible. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  And the one thing that we can say now, though, is that we understand the stakes of this election. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=276.14000000000004s)]
*  What are they? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=283.5s)]
*  Well, the stakes plain and simple are freedom. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=284.5s)]
*  The stakes plain and simple are whether or not women have the right to make reproductive [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=287.46s)]
*  health care decisions. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=293.22s)]
*  That to me is not a decision that government should intervene in, and it is certainly not [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=295.58s)]
*  within the confines of the national Republican party to put their foot down and say we're [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=301.1s)]
*  going to institute a nationwide abortion ban. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=308.54s)]
*  It is inhumane, it's tragic, it's sick, it's disgusting, and all it does is reveal, though, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=310.46s)]
*  is the stakes of this election. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=315.3s)]
*  You heard Mitch McConnell talk about candidate quality. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=317.42s)]
*  It's obviously become a big issue across the board. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=320.42s)]
*  In the races that you're seeing, in down-ballot races, you have people who are election deniers [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=322.5s)]
*  running for powerful positions in this country, you have people who are extremists who are [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=328.18s)]
*  running. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=332.14s)]
*  What do you make of the quality of the candidates that you're seeing in this election cycle? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=333.14s)]
*  Well, look, I'll leave the punditry to you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=336.02s)]
*  But what I do know is that even if you look at my election on Staten Island, my opponent, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=339.18s)]
*  Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis, has been unwilling to state her position on the Lindsey [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=346.18s)]
*  Graham nationwide abortion ban. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  At first she claimed that she wasn't aware of the bill. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=355.66s)]
*  She said, well, I haven't seen it, deliver it to my office. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=359.14s)]
*  So a constituent delivered it to her office, and she has still not expressed her position [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=361.38s)]
*  on it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  It reverberates around such a fundamental human right, and she is unwilling to come [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=368.9s)]
*  out and say where her position is because she and so many other Republicans, look at [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=373.5s)]
*  their choice. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  Either be on the side of the vast majority of Americans who believe that this is a woman's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=380.53999999999996s)]
*  right to make this decision or go against the extremist leadership of the Republican [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=385.9s)]
*  National Party. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=390.84s)]
*  And unfortunately, she and so many other members of Congress and the Republican Party are unwilling [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=393.05999999999995s)]
*  to do the courageous thing and side with the majority. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=397.7s)]
*  You have probably seen, as I'm sure the rest of the country has, in Washington horror, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=402.02s)]
*  the images of migrants being trafficked effectively across state lines just for political theater [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=405.7s)]
*  by Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=413.0s)]
*  We're seeing it here in New York as well. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=416.5s)]
*  What is your reaction to it as a New Yorker when you see these migrants being used as [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=419.12s)]
*  political pawns in this Republican state? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=423.98s)]
*  We all know, and you used this word earlier, tragic. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=427.22s)]
*  It's tragic, it's inhumane, I think it's utterly disgusting. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=430.74s)]
*  But there's one other thing that we have not given as much attention to, which is that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=434.06s)]
*  in the case of Ron DeSantis, it demonstrates how feckless and ridiculous and ineffective [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=437.54s)]
*  of a leader he actually is. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  This was a guy that was so horrified by the fact that Greg Abbott was getting more coverage [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=444.26000000000005s)]
*  than him that he decided to utilize millions of dollars of public funds to charter a plane [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  just so he could enter, reenter the national debate. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=456.52s)]
*  I think sensible Americans, and that is the vast, vast, vast majority of human beings, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=461.0s)]
*  understand that human trafficking, kidnapping people is absolutely wrong and that we also [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  on the same hand can come together and execute comprehensive, sensible immigration reform [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=474.53999999999996s)]
*  that involves, yes, of course, a secure border, yes, of course, a surge of lawyers, but has [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  humanity and compassion built into its very core. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=486.06s)]
*  That is what this country is all about, and it's not too much to ask. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=489.68s)]
*  Let me ask you about the midterm elections, your specific race here for a moment if I [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=492.8s)]
*  can. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=496.9s)]
*  What have you learned this time around then from your previous election? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=498.0s)]
*  As I mentioned, you're a former congressman, you're back in the fight. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=501.96s)]
*  What are you bringing this time around that you didn't the first time? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=505.62s)]
*  Here's what I understand. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=508.66s)]
*  The stakes could not be higher than where they are right now, and we have seen that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=511.74s)]
*  continue and continue. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=518.24s)]
*  Starting from the very beginning of 2021, where we saw the Republican Party actually [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=520.64s)]
*  spit on the Constitution, the very same Constitution that I swore to uphold and defend as an army [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=526.3s)]
*  officer that I watched people get hurt in combat fighting for, they didn't care because [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=532.36s)]
*  Donald Trump said something and they went against this country. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=536.98s)]
*  But then you look at what would have happened if Kevin McCarthy had been the Speaker of [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=540.96s)]
*  the House over the course of the last two years. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=544.4200000000001s)]
*  The bipartisan infrastructure bill never would have happened. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=546.82s)]
*  Comprehensive gun reform never ever would have happened. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=550.26s)]
*  We never would have seen the massive, massive bill to finally do something about climate [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=553.34s)]
*  change. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=559.6600000000001s)]
*  All of these things, many of which are bipartisan, never would have occurred. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=560.6600000000001s)]
*  So the stakes are incredibly high, and I think that people across the country, to include [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=564.74s)]
*  in my district, understand that, and they're going to voice their opinions at the polls on Election Day. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=569.04s)]
*  We'll be watching very closely. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=574.0s)]
*  Former Congressman Max Rowe, it's great to see you in person, my friend. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=575.24s)]
*  It's been a long time. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=577.4s)]
*  It's great to see you again. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=578.4s)]
*  Best of luck to you. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=579.4s)]
*  Take care. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZH8nmiXEsY&t=580.4s)]
