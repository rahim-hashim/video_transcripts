# Rep. Lloyd Doggett blasts the House GOP’s marathon Speaker debacle
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg)
*  Good news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=0.0s)]
*  The House of Representatives officially has a new speaker. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=7.12s)]
*  In the early hours of the morning, after four days and, yes, 15 rounds of voting, Kevin [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=10.6s)]
*  McCarthy managed to drag himself across the finish line. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=17.3s)]
*  Earlier today, President Biden released a statement congratulating the new speaker, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=20.84s)]
*  pledging to work with McCarthy to deliver for the American people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=25.16s)]
*  While House Republicans spent the week bickering, Biden was busy building bridges, literally. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=28.72s)]
*  On Wednesday, the president traveled to Kentucky to celebrate last year's bipartisan infrastructure [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=38.32s)]
*  law. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=42.84s)]
*  More than $1 billion in funds from that bill will go towards repairs and upgrades for the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=43.84s)]
*  Brett Spence Bridge. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Biden stood alongside Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, you see there on your screen, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=50.84s)]
*  to make that announcement, creating a stark split screen between what was happening there [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=54.68s)]
*  and the chaos back in Washington. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=60.2s)]
*  And the bridge serves as a symbol of what can happen when Republicans and Democrats [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=62.96s)]
*  put aside their differences to work together for the good of the American people. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=67.64s)]
*  I know that sounds crazy at times. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=71.52s)]
*  It is something we expect to see very little of, in fact, in the 118th Congress. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=73.4s)]
*  In exchange for the gavel, McCarthy made a series of concessions to his party's far-right [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=78.2s)]
*  rebels, including allowing any member to call for a motion to vacate the speaker's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=82.36s)]
*  chair at any time, no doubt forecasting more chaos in the years ahead. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=87.96s)]
*  And McCarthy also promised members of the far-right Freedom Caucus key committee assignments. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=92.72s)]
*  Over the next two years, the Republican Party's far-right faction will be more emboldened [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=97.6s)]
*  than ever. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=102.36s)]
*  As one Democratic lawmaker told the New York Times, quote, the concessions he has made [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=103.36s)]
*  means that it will be a minority of a minority of the minority that will get to dictate [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=107.56s)]
*  the outcomes of legislative achievement. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=113.52s)]
*  So much for the People's House, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=116.76s)]
*  Let's discuss that and more with Congressman Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=119.28s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  First, let me get your reaction to these last few days on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=126.44s)]
*  What are your big takeaways when you see the chaos that we just witnessed? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=130.24s)]
*  Do you expect this kind of chaos to carry on over the next two years? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=135.2s)]
*  Well, thanks, Eamon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  We're really part of about a two-year marathon. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  For the majority party to select its speaker is supposed to be the easy part. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=144.16s)]
*  It's like the runner putting on his shoes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=148.76s)]
*  You don't get any applause at that point. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=151.48s)]
*  Normally, in this case, the runner, Mr. McCarthy, has tripped over his shoes about 14 times [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=153.32s)]
*  before he became speaker. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=159.2s)]
*  Now we have this crowd of Republicans, and it's pretty hard to find a moderate Republican [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=161.36s)]
*  these days. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=167.84s)]
*  I think you can count them on your fingers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=168.84s)]
*  But you've got this crowd of Republicans that McCarthy is indebted to. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=170.96s)]
*  And when we face a crisis, perhaps natural or manmade crisis over coming months, we're [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  going to be in a position where he's not really capable of negotiating a solution. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  When we have to pass the legislation to keep the government in operation, when we come [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=191.2s)]
*  up to the question of the full faith and credit of the United States, if Ukraine needs more [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  resources, these are the kind of major questions where it's not just the chaos of the last [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=201.76s)]
*  week, but what it portends about chaos going forward on these major questions that affect [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  our families and the world. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=214.76s)]
*  Yeah, and these are, in fact, major questions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=216.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about the substance and the style of what you can expect from the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=218.8s)]
*  Republicans, because if last week was an indicator, it does not bode well for you and your colleagues. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=221.72s)]
*  At one point during the 14th vote, you had Republican Congressman Mike Rogers, who had [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=227.24s)]
*  to physically be restrained from going after his own colleague, Matt Gaetz. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=231.36s)]
*  So if the GOP can't keep things civil between one another, how do you expect them to work [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  across the aisle with you and your colleagues? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=242.0s)]
*  I think it will be very difficult. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=244.52s)]
*  And as you know, mixed into all this is the ever-presence of Donald Trump. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=247.4s)]
*  He had an influence in this race. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=253.68s)]
*  Ironically, a speaker elected at the same time we are honoring the second anniversary [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=256.96s)]
*  of the attempt by Donald Trump to overthrow our government. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  But I think it will be a big challenge. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=267.8s)]
*  There certainly are some small matters that I'm working with some Republicans on trying [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=269.6s)]
*  to pass, but on the major questions of the day, our foreign policy, our national security, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=274.94s)]
*  the appropriations necessary to provide essential services to families across our country, those [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=280.22s)]
*  are going to be really tough because we will have a group of Republicans who really don't [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  believe in government. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=291.38s)]
*  And I guess to some extent, they're right when they say government's never the answer [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=292.98s)]
*  because when they're in charge, it seldom can be the answer. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=296.46000000000004s)]
*  What concerns you about the rules package? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=301.22s)]
*  It's obviously going to be the center of what may have been compromised between Kevin [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=303.74s)]
*  McCarthy and this far-right members of the Republican caucus. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=309.1s)]
*  What kind of impact will those new rules have on the ability to legislate? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  What are you concerned about? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, there are many aspects of it that are troubling, including aspects that McCarthy [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=320.90000000000003s)]
*  had agreed to before he ever got himself into this situation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=326.26s)]
*  One of those that always bothers me is the only way you can have an increase in a necessary [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=330.46s)]
*  expenditure for education or health under their plan is to cut something else. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=337.09999999999997s)]
*  But they don't apply that to taxes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=342.85999999999996s)]
*  Taxes have the same effect. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  These major cuts that they did under Trump, they have the same effect as increases in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=346.82s)]
*  spending, but they don't want to provide for paying for those cuts. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=351.94s)]
*  Then there's the role that will be permitted that any member of the House can call for [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=357.78s)]
*  the Speaker's basically removal. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=364.46s)]
*  And that's something they will hang over Speaker McCarthy's head anytime there are serious [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=368.34s)]
*  negotiations about a problem where the Senate has agreed on something and the President [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  has agreed on something and all that remains is for the House to come together and he will [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=377.9s)]
*  not have the capacity to do that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=382.5s)]
*  With the Republicans now in the driver's seat in the Congress over the next two years, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=385.53999999999996s)]
*  what game plan do Democrats, you and your colleagues have over the next two years? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=390.02s)]
*  What do you guys do over the next two years? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=394.7s)]
*  Will there be even more pressure on President Biden to use executive action or what do you [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=396.85999999999996s)]
*  plan on doing? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=402.58s)]
*  We do need to ensure, particularly in areas like the climate crisis where we made such [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=404.38s)]
*  progress last fall with the legislation we adopted on incentives to engage more families [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=409.82s)]
*  in fighting the climate crisis. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=416.82s)]
*  We need to be sure on that and on pollution that the President is using all of his authority. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=419.05999999999995s)]
*  The same thing is true with reference to worker safety and the standards for our workers. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=424.58s)]
*  But on some other areas that are very important to me, the right of choice of women to control [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=429.9s)]
*  their own bodies, we have to stand up for our principals and advocate them forcefully [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=436.26s)]
*  even if we can't pass the legislation we need to protect those rights. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=441.66s)]
*  We need to provide a respectful alternative to the extremist policies that the Republicans [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=446.86s)]
*  are advocating. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=453.1s)]
*  The first bill up, appropriately I guess after the rules package that they've scheduled [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=454.62s)]
*  next week, is basically a bill for tax cheats. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=459.66s)]
*  They propose to eliminate 90% of the funding that we increased last year to enforce the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=463.9s)]
*  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=470.58s)]
*  We know that over the last decade there's been a decline by about 75% of audits for [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=473.38s)]
*  those at the top and that's what they propose to eliminate. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=478.64s)]
*  I want to ask you about your party's leadership. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=483.46s)]
*  You have a new party leader, Congressman, not party leader but certainly party leader [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=485.34s)]
*  within Congress, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  Let me play for you a bit of his first speech as minority leader. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  We are white, we are black, we are Latino, we are Asian, we are Native American, we are [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=495.74s)]
*  Christian, we are Jewish, we are Muslim, we are Hindu, we are religious, we are secular, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=500.46000000000004s)]
*  we are gay, we are straight, we are young, we are older, we are women, we are men, we [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=505.46000000000004s)]
*  are citizens, we are dreamers, out of many, we are one, that's what makes America a great [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=510.2s)]
*  country. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=516.34s)]
*  And no matter what kind of haters are trying to divide us, we're not going to let anyone [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=518.34s)]
*  take that away from us, not now, not ever. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=526.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't think you could have casted a more contrasting speech to go before Kevin McCarthy [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=530.3000000000001s)]
*  if you tried in Hollywood or anywhere. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=536.62s)]
*  I mean put aside policy for a moment, just the oratory skills of leader Jeffries were [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=538.7800000000001s)]
*  quite remarkable in that display. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=543.98s)]
*  What does it say about his leadership, his skills, and what role he will play in the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=547.24s)]
*  next crucial few years? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=553.36s)]
*  Well, it was a beautiful speech. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=555.36s)]
*  It powerfully laid out what our priorities are and what our values and principles are, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  and all the more powerful in that he delivered that speech about one in the morning after [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=563.48s)]
*  a very long day's work. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=568.28s)]
*  The other thing that I think is equally important to his great ability as a communicator is [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=571.72s)]
*  his ability as a leader. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=577.36s)]
*  Time after time on those 14 votes, there were 212 Democrats, 212 Democrats voting for Hakeem [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=579.88s)]
*  Jeffries. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=588.08s)]
*  We're working together. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=589.08s)]
*  We have a big ten in our party, some great diversity among the different elements of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=590.08s)]
*  our party, but our working together with Hakeem and our new leadership is what will give us [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=594.2s)]
*  the strength to win in 2024 and to stand up to the worst of the extremism we can expect [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=599.28s)]
*  from the Republicans. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=606.72s)]
*  Sir, before I let you go, I wanted to ask you. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=607.72s)]
*  You sit on the House and Ways, the House Ways and Means Committee, which of course before [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=610.52s)]
*  the Democrats lost control, you released years of Trump's tax returns. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=616.16s)]
*  The information is now public. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=621.36s)]
*  What next? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=623.5s)]
*  Well, we saw that Trump had big credits that were never big losses, big credits, big deductions [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=625.22s)]
*  that were never audited until we began investigating this by the Internal Revenue Service. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=632.82s)]
*  I think we make the case based on the experience with Trump that the first bill these Republicans [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=638.86s)]
*  are offering is only designed to help tax cheats. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=643.82s)]
*  They need to believe in law and order for enforcing our tax code as much as they do [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=647.02s)]
*  in other forms of law and order. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=650.82s)]
*  I think that there may be some more work for the Democratic controlled Senate to do with [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=653.06s)]
*  reference to Trump's tax returns and certainly to see that those audits get completed of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  his returns and that he pays what's due. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=664.3399999999999s)]
*  Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett, sir, thank you so much for joining us this Saturday evening. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=668.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=671.6199999999999s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your time as always, sir. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl7Tc3m4eg&t=672.6199999999999s)]
