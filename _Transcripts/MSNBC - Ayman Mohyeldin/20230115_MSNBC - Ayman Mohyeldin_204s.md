Video Description: Republicans can’t run on their unpopular policies like passing anti-abortion bills so right-wing media has been working overtime obsessing over female M&M’s packaging and falsely accusing the Biden Administration of wanting to ban gas stoves. MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin breaks down the right-wing media’s desperate and cynical strategy of creating culture wars to deflect from the House GOP chaos.

# GOP distracts from unpopular agenda with culture war fantasies
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s)
*  All right, it's time now for our worst of the week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=0.0s)]
*  And man, these contenders, they prove just how desperate the GOP can get in these cultural [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=5.72s)]
*  wars. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=10.52s)]
*  Republicans have unpopular policies, and so of course they prefer to distract from those [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=11.52s)]
*  policies by getting people upset about fake controversies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=15.4s)]
*  And you've heard them all before. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=19.56s)]
*  Democrats want to cancel Dr. Seuss. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  There's the so-called war on Christmas, the weird pregnant Joker comic frenzy this week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=24.32s)]
*  It's all an attempt to paint Democrats as more radical than the GOP. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=29.52s)]
*  So as House Republicans pushed forward this week with their unpopular agenda, passing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=34.04s)]
*  anti-abortion laws, promoting tax cuts for the super wealthy, how did the right-wing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=38.08s)]
*  media respond? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=43.28s)]
*  By covering the true problems in this country, like woke M&Ms. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=45.34s)]
*  Fox began the week freaking out over M&Ms releasing female-focused candy packaging featuring [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=50.72s)]
*  the green, brown, and purple M&Ms. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=57.18s)]
*  The intended pro-woman message was deemed too woke. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=60.58s)]
*  And then there of course was the war on gas stoves. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=65.28s)]
*  The drama started when a member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in an interview [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=67.78s)]
*  that the agency was considering regulations on indoor air pollution from gas stoves. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=72.18s)]
*  The right twisted that to mean the Biden administration was in the process of banning gas stoves, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=77.98s)]
*  and in effect painted the White House as a big brother type who wanted to interfere [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=83.3s)]
*  in your kitchen. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=88.46s)]
*  This faux outrage was peddled by Jim Jordan who tweeted, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=90.2s)]
*  God guns gas stoves. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=93.0s)]
*  Ronny Jackson, the famed doctor, tweeted, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  If the maniacs come from my stove, they can pry it from my cold dead hands. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=98.06s)]
*  Of course, as with the M&M issue, Fox does freak out the best. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=103.86s)]
*  M&Ms, the candy, back to pushing woke politics. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=110.1s)]
*  Is this blue? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=113.3s)]
*  Is it non-binary? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=114.69999999999999s)]
*  Is it democratic? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=116.1s)]
*  I think this is the kind of thing that makes China say like, oh good, keep focusing on that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=117.1s)]
*  I'm glad that at least some of these M&Ms will have nuts to represent the transgender community. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  The White House is weighing a nationwide ban on gas stoves. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=125.5s)]
*  Watch out, the government is coming for your gas stove. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=129.1s)]
*  Not only is Biden coming for your paycheck, but he's also coming for your stove. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=132.7s)]
*  Big brother is coming for your kitchen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=137.3s)]
*  So naturally, they decided gas powered stoves, racist and have to go. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  Nobody's going to tell me I can't cook with gas. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=144.10000000000002s)]
*  It's totally fine to get fentanyl to addicts, but a gas stove is a threat to your life. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=146.5s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=152.3s)]
*  It works every time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=153.9s)]
*  You find a villain, real or in most cases for them, imaginary, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  and then you just stoke the fears over and over. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  Make the base afraid that the world is changing and that that change is so bad [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  and that the change is the fault of none other than the Democrats and the woke left. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=166.7s)]
*  You take the focus off of your bad policies and make your opponents the true enemies. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=171.1s)]
*  Thanks to a bunch of lies and innuendo. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=176.1s)]
*  You [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyquMAC7-1s&t=196.7s)]
