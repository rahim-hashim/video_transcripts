# Trump and allies demand mistrial based on debunked post by Facebook troll
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q)
*  Let me ask you, Renato, about this conspiracy theory. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  And we certainly know that Trump and his acolytes love a conspiracy theory. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=3.36s)]
*  On Judge Mershon on Friday, I believe, flagged this to the prosecution defense about a comment [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=7.04s)]
*  that was made on Facebook by someone who was claiming to be a cousin to one of the jurors, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  saying that Trump was going to be convicted ahead of the verdict. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=16.88s)]
*  Of course, the claim has since been debunked. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=19.88s)]
*  It came from a Facebook troll. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=22.8s)]
*  But that's not going to stop Trump and, as I said, his acolytes from running with this [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=25.16s)]
*  is to attack the judge in the process. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=29.56s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Was the fix in from the beginning? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=34.36s)]
*  Is this cause for a mistrial? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=35.92s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  Cause for mistrial? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  If that's not cause for a mistrial, I don't know what is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what it is either, but here we are. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=44.04s)]
*  So what do you make of how Sean Hannity is running with this? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=45.8s)]
*  And just lay it down for us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=49.84s)]
*  Lay the law for us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=50.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=51.84s)]
*  I mean, it's not serious, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=52.84s)]
*  When you look at the Facebook account that made that post, in the bio for that account, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=54.04s)]
*  it says it's a crap poster. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=59.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=61.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=62.0s)]
*  A non-offensive way to say that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=63.0s)]
*  But essentially, the person's come forward and admitted that that was just, you know, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=66.32s)]
*  you call the trolling. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=70.4s)]
*  You know, realistically, is that something that the judge should have brought to the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=71.4s)]
*  party's attention? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=76.28s)]
*  Is it something that people should have taken a look at? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=77.28s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=79.0s)]
*  But now that it's debunked, promoting that and trying to mislead people is irresponsible. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=80.0s)]
*  Should the judge have waited a little bit? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=84.0s)]
*  Should the judge have said, let's look at whether this is real before coming out publicly [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=85.68s)]
*  with it? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=90.04s)]
*  I think what the judge is trying to do is get out ahead of things and basically show [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=91.04s)]
*  that he is not putting a thumb in the scale one way or the other. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=94.16s)]
*  Tara, I'm sure you're shocked that Trump and his flock are holding on to this debunked [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=97.28s)]
*  conspiracy theory because I'm sure it'll be featured very prominently in many of his campaign [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=101.28s)]
*  stops for the next several months. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=107.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter that it's been debunked. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=109.16s)]
*  It doesn't matter how many times we're going to play any clips that show that it's not [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=110.48s)]
*  true. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=114.28s)]
*  How do you see them in their world now? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, they live in an alternative universe. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  And so it's a universe that we all don't live in. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=119.52s)]
*  And it's a truth free and fact free universe. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=121.4s)]
*  It's the alternative facts universe of MAGA world. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=124.2s)]
*  So you know, but he hasn't already started doing this at rallies, just doing that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=127.6s)]
*  It started on the Sunday shows today. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=132.24s)]
*  His surrogates were out there repeating this nonsense about how, oh, there's probably going [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=135.0s)]
*  to be a mistrial now because of misconduct by this judge and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=138.4s)]
*  They continue to repeat this over and over and over again. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=142.72s)]
*  But the only people who buy this are the 90 percent who already believe Donald Trump and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  think they're going to vote for him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=150.88s)]
*  It's the 10 percent of Republicans and those others being 10 to 15 percent that are they [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=152.28s)]
*  really looking at this case and saying, yeah, no, it's not a big deal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=157.24s)]
*  We're going to vote for the convicted felon. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=161.96s)]
*  So Trump and his acolytes can continue to do this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=162.96s)]
*  But the average American independent moderate voters, they're sick of it and not comfortable [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=165.56s)]
*  voting for a convicted felon, nor should they. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=169.52s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say for Judge Merchant, damned if you do, damned if you don't. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=171.4s)]
*  If he doesn't say anything about it, they're going to point and say he tried to cover it up. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=174.68s)]
*  If he comes out and says something about it, they use it and say, look, the judge is even [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=178.4s)]
*  saying now that there is something shady about here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=181.88s)]
*  Otherwise, the judge wouldn't have said it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=184.0s)]
*  So as I said, here we are. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70V4uNFiD6Q&t=185.28s)]
