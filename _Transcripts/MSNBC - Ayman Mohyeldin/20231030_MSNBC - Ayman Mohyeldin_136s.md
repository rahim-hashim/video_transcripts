# Judge reinstates gag order in Trump election case
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs)
*  The judge overseeing Donald Trump's federal election subversion criminal case just reinstated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=0.0s)]
*  the gag order she issued on the ex-president earlier this month, a significant development [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=11.32s)]
*  made by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkin, who denied Trump's request to pause the initial [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=16.04s)]
*  order while his appeal plays out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=21.68s)]
*  She also lifted a temporary freeze on the gag order that she issued on October 20th [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=25.54s)]
*  while she considered his request. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=31.22s)]
*  Now, you may recall the gag order, which was limited in its initial scope, had prohibited [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=33.22s)]
*  Donald Trump from making certain statements about the special counsel's team or potential [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=38.06s)]
*  witnesses, including any comments that directly targeted the court's personnel, potential [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=43.66s)]
*  witnesses or the special counsel and his staff. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=49.58s)]
*  Now, here's some important context on this late breaking development on this Sunday evening. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=53.86s)]
*  Earlier this week, following a report that his former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows might [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=58.74s)]
*  have actually reached an immunity deal with the special counsel, Donald Trump attacked [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=63.42s)]
*  Meadows on his failed social media site. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=69.42s)]
*  As a response to that attack against Meadows, Jack Smith accused Trump of threatening Meadows, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=72.6s)]
*  alleging that Trump sent, quote, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=78.5s)]
*  He then asked Judge Chutkin to unpause that stay and basically reinstate the gag order. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=85.38s)]
*  Now, in that 32-page filing, Smith offered a stark warning here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=93.06s)]
*  He wrote in part, quote, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  at risk. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuS-5aGkSYs&t=108.42s)]
