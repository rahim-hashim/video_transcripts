# Wisconsin At The Center Of GOP Election Litigation Chaos
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs)
*  All right, so tonight, as of tonight, already, 22 million ballots have been cast across the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=0.0s)]
*  country. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=7.84s)]
*  And while early voting is now in full swing, so, too, are the legal challenges. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=8.84s)]
*  According to NBC News, more than 100 lawsuits have been filed this year, largely by Republicans [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=12.88s)]
*  targeting rules over mail-in voting, early voting, voter access, voting machines, voting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=18.84s)]
*  registrations, the counting of mismarked absentee ballots and access for partisan poll watchers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=24.52s)]
*  All of this is echoing the tactics that perpetuated the election in 2020 by Trump and his allies [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=31.16s)]
*  in their effort to overturn the results of a free and fair election. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=38.72s)]
*  It is the most litigation ever before an election, and it's likely a preview of a potentially [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=43.2s)]
*  contentious post-election landscape. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=48.8s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=51.44s)]
*  The 2020 election effort was an ad hoc response, fronted by a collection of ill-prepared conservative [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  lawyers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  You remember their names, Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, and his air die. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  But this year's effort is actually more formalized. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=62.64s)]
*  It's well-funded. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=65.56s)]
*  It's actually very well-organized. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=66.56s)]
*  Republican Party officials say they are actively preparing for recounts, contested elections, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=69.1s)]
*  and even more litigation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  And there are thousands of volunteers in place, prying to challenge ballots and hunt down [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  evidence of malfeasance, even though there's always scant evidence of that in our elections. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=81.12s)]
*  Now, one of the states at the center of this conservative chaos is Wisconsin. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  Wisconsin's Republican Party has signed up more than 5,000 people to work the polls, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  three times as many as they did back in 2020 elections. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=97.72s)]
*  Frontline election workers say that they are facing aggressive questioning of longstanding [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  election practices from voters skeptical of fraud. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  And we have to remind you, there isn't significant fraud in this country. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=110.12s)]
*  And the executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission says that she's even gotten [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=113.84s)]
*  death threats. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=117.72s)]
*  Now, to counteract some of that, just last night, President Obama rallied an electric [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=118.72s)]
*  crowd in Milwaukee, campaigning for the Democratic ticket. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=124.24s)]
*  That includes Mandela Barnes, Tony Evers, and our next guest, Wisconsin Attorney General [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=127.6s)]
*  Josh Call. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=132.16s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=133.16s)]
*  Mandela's opponent has done more than just about anybody in Congress to spread conspiracy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=135.12s)]
*  theories about the 2020 election. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=140.92s)]
*  You've got Republicans in the Wisconsin state legislature trying to give themselves power [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=142.92s)]
*  to do whatever they want. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=148.8s)]
*  Here in Wisconsin, already the map is so gerrymandered. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=150.0s)]
*  And if they pick up a few more seats in both chambers, they'll be able to force through [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=154.8s)]
*  extreme unpopular laws on everything from guns to education to abortion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=159.52s)]
*  And there won't be anything Democrats can do about it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=164.28s)]
*  Now, right now, the only person standing in their way is Tony Evers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=166.08s)]
*  And that's part of the much larger fight ahead in the state of Wisconsin. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=173.72s)]
*  Due to years of unchecked redistricting, Wisconsin is so heavily gerrymandered in favor of Republicans [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=177.96s)]
*  that the state GOP is now within reach of a supermajority in the state legislature, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=183.96s)]
*  which, according to Mother Jones, would give them remarkable power to override the governor's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  veto and implement an extreme and unpopular agenda on issues ranging from guns to education [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=193.64s)]
*  to abortion. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=200.04s)]
*  It could even give them the ability to overturn the results of elections. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=201.04s)]
*  Everything, and I mean everything, is on the line in this election. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  When people like President Obama say democracy is on the ballot, it is not hyperbolic. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=210.44s)]
*  He is not exaggerating. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=215.16s)]
*  He's being dead serious. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=216.72s)]
*  Joining me now is Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Call. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=219.24s)]
*  Attorney General, sir, thank you so much for your time this evening. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=222.32s)]
*  I know we're in the midst of a campaign. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=224.96s)]
*  It's very busy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=226.4s)]
*  Your reaction, though, I have to ask you, to the growing number of mostly Republican [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=227.4s)]
*  election-related lawsuits. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=232.0s)]
*  And have you seen legal challenges in your own state? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=234.8s)]
*  You know, in Wisconsin, we are sort of in a state of constant litigation over our elections, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=238.24s)]
*  unfortunately. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=243.92s)]
*  I have seen that in this cycle. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=245.11999999999998s)]
*  There was a lawsuit brought that ultimately led to ballot drop boxes not being permissible. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=247.0s)]
*  There's been litigation over what needs to be included for the witness information on [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=254.0s)]
*  absentee ballots to be counted. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=258.68s)]
*  But what's, I think, really fundamental is that there's a clear set of rules going into [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=261.08s)]
*  the election. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=265.24s)]
*  I think we have that now because what we saw with Trump in 2020 was not just challenges [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=266.24s)]
*  to the rules, but challenges after the facts. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=272.12s)]
*  So people relied on their clerks. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=274.32s)]
*  They followed their guidance. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=276.4s)]
*  And then Trump still tried to challenge those ballots. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  That is my concern right now. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  I feel good that we're in a place where there's not going to be those kinds of challenges, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=282.23999999999995s)]
*  but we certainly need to be prepared. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=286.52s)]
*  Let me just dig in on that for a moment. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=288.2s)]
*  The Republican National Committee and its allies have staged thousands of, you know, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=290.4s)]
*  quote, training sessions around the country for election volunteers to spot so-called [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=295.2s)]
*  fraud. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  There's very insignificant quantities across the country. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  Are states like Wisconsin, is your state ready for this tactic? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=304.48s)]
*  We are. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=310.6s)]
*  I expect that we're going to have the election go smoothly and that we're not going to have [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=311.6s)]
*  issues at the polls. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=314.68s)]
*  But that being said, if there are issues, we're prepared. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=315.68s)]
*  And we had a dry run for this in 2020 when Donald Trump was out suggesting to people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  that they should intimidate voters at the polls. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=323.88s)]
*  We were prepared then. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=326.12s)]
*  We made clear to the public that if people engaged in voter intimidation, they should [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=327.88s)]
*  expect to spend time behind bars. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=332.0s)]
*  The same thing remains true in 2022. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Local law enforcement, DAs and the Wisconsin Department of Justice work collaboratively. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=337.2s)]
*  And if there are issues, people should know that law enforcement is going to respond. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=342.84s)]
*  We also have a lot of authority for the election officials who are running polling places in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=347.24s)]
*  Wisconsin. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=352.84s)]
*  It's fine for people to go to polling places to observe. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=353.84s)]
*  But once they start interfering with the process, that's where they're crossing the line. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=357.68s)]
*  And our election officials have a lot of authority to maintain order in polling places. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=361.52s)]
*  And if people don't follow those instructions, they could be committing a crime. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=366.68s)]
*  And we are very clear that if people do commit those kinds of crimes, we take them very seriously [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=370.8s)]
*  because this is our democracy we're talking about. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=375.06s)]
*  We need to protect the voting process and make sure that it's safe, secure, free and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=377.64s)]
*  fair. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=382.28s)]
*  Your opponent, your Republican opponent, Eric Tony, said in the debate that he will accept [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=383.28s)]
*  the results of the election. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=388.76s)]
*  And I'm almost a little embarrassed to say this, but this is where we are as a country [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=390.32s)]
*  with the Republican Party. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=394.84s)]
*  Do you believe him that we are at, when you have an official saying he will accept the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=396.41999999999996s)]
*  results of the election, we almost have to verify it these days. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=400.64s)]
*  Do you believe him? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=404.44s)]
*  You know, first, it's really a sad reflection on what happened with the Trump campaign that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=405.44s)]
*  we do have to have this question asked in the debate. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  I do believe my opponent will do that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  He has embraced some of these far right conspiracy theorists. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=416.36s)]
*  He supported Michael Gabelman's sham investigation into our elections, for example, and claimed [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  that election officials broke the law and should be removed from office. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  But I do think he'll accept the results. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=430.82000000000005s)]
*  Now we've also got Ron Johnson running here. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=433.0s)]
*  We've got Tim Michaels running who has Donald Trump support. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=435.70000000000005s)]
*  What kind of pressures they get from Trump or others remains to be seen. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  But the bottom line is that we know that our elections are safe and secure. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=443.56s)]
*  And in Wisconsin, they've been repeatedly tested. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=447.36s)]
*  We had a statewide recount in 2016. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=449.92s)]
*  We had recounts of our two largest counties in 2020 and then all sorts of litigation. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=452.36s)]
*  We know that our system works and that the results are accurate. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  So the question ultimately for candidates who lose these elections is going to be if [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  they're willing to accept the results and the truth or if they're going to fight back [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=464.96s)]
*  as we saw with Donald Trump in 2020. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=469.36s)]
*  Let me ask you about President Obama. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=471.68s)]
*  He campaigned with you last night and the entire Democratic ticket in Wisconsin. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=473.28s)]
*  What does it mean to have the support of the former president? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=477.44s)]
*  Obviously, having any president is incredible in a campaign, but somebody like Barack Obama, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  who is widely considered to be an amazing orator, a great politician, just a master communicator. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=485.76s)]
*  Well, first, it's great to have President Obama in Wisconsin. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  I think we are going to have record breaking turnout this year. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  And there was a packed house at the event with President Obama yesterday, and he laid out [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=500.24s)]
*  the stakes in this election as clearly as I think anybody had. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=506.0s)]
*  Republicans have a radical, extreme far right agenda. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=509.44s)]
*  We've already seen that with abortion, where a constitutional right that had been in place [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=513.44s)]
*  for almost 50 years was taken away from people. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=518.24s)]
*  But that's not where this agenda stops. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=521.6s)]
*  As he talked about very clearly last night, Republicans are coming after Social Security [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=523.36s)]
*  and Medicare. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  They want to reduce education spending. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  They want to reduce resources for our local governments, which fund local law enforcement [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=530.72s)]
*  and other critical public safety services. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=534.8s)]
*  They want to weaken protections when it comes to gun safety. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=537.6s)]
*  This is an extreme agenda, and the stakes are enormous, not to mention issues like our [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=541.36s)]
*  democracy. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  We need to win these elections. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=547.04s)]
*  I think people are really motivated, but having the president here certainly is going to help [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=548.4s)]
*  keep folks motivated as we head into the final days of the campaign. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=552.8s)]
*  All right, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Call, thank you so much for joining us this [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  evening. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  I greatly appreciate your time and insights. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=559.3599999999999s)]
*  you [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF_Pw7VJZCs&t=585.68s)]
