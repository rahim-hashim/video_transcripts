# Ending affirmative action: the result of a 50-year Republican passion project
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs)
*  If at first you do not succeed, try and try again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=0.0s)]
*  That has been the guiding mantra of the conservative legal movement for decades. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=4.8s)]
*  Float a case before the Supreme Court, get a couple of justices on your side, and then [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=9.24s)]
*  use their opinions as a guide to shop the nation for a case that gives the justices [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  everything needed for them to finally take action. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=19.52s)]
*  It is a strategy that actually predates the Trump era and this specific court, but became [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=22.0s)]
*  supercharged with this new conservative supermajority. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=29.78s)]
*  Republicans waited for decades to overturn Roe vs. Wade, bringing several unsuccessful [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  cases before the court until finally succeeding last term with the Dobbs decision. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=39.02s)]
*  Think about how Christian activists first brought the plight of a Colorado baker who [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=45.46s)]
*  didn't want to bake a gay wedding cake to the court in 2018, and then used a suggestion [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=49.42s)]
*  from Clarence Thomas that the case should actually have been considered on free speech [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=55.76s)]
*  grounds rather than a religious liberty test. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=60.68s)]
*  Five years later, we had the 303 creative vs. Ellenist decision effectively making LGBTQ [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=64.88s)]
*  plus individuals second class citizens. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=71.36s)]
*  That same cynical perseverance has now led to the gutting of affirmative action in college [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=74.6s)]
*  admissions. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=80.56s)]
*  Since Roe was overturned, it is clear this court has no qualms about undoing long established [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=81.88s)]
*  precedent. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=88.44s)]
*  And believe me, there were mountains of precedent upholding the constitutionality of affirmative [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  action in America, specifically because of the 50-year Republican project aimed at destroying [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=95.24s)]
*  that policy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=100.84s)]
*  So let's look at how we got to this point, because this is the playbook conservatives [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  are using for anything they don't like or approve of, even if it takes decades to overturn [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=108.16s)]
*  and see those results. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=114.32s)]
*  Affirmative action as a term actually entered the public lexicon back in 1935 with the Wagner [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  Act, a federal law that gave workers the right to form and join unions. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=122.16s)]
*  It was used to describe the process by which an employee would be given their job back [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=125.64s)]
*  if the National Labor Relations Board found they had been fired for union activity. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=131.12s)]
*  John F. Kennedy was the first president to link the term specifically with policies meant [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=136.44s)]
*  to advance racial equality. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=141.12s)]
*  And in the years after, the term started to be associated with education, a connection [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  made thanks to the civil rights movement. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=148.44s)]
*  The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 was a turning point. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=151.44s)]
*  Students demanded their colleges redouble their efforts to have students and student [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  bodies that actually better reflected American society. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=161.56s)]
*  As the New York Times reports, less than four weeks after Dr. King's death, Harvard's Dean [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=166.72s)]
*  of Admissions at the time, well, he announced a commitment to enrolling a substantially [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=171.68s)]
*  higher number of African Americans. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=175.72s)]
*  The following years admitted class included a 76% increase in black students. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=177.68s)]
*  And you better believe that conservatives immediately began gnashing their teeth. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=185.08s)]
*  The first Supreme Court case challenging the constitutionality of affirmative action [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=189.76s)]
*  programs and education came just a decade later. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  In 1978, the Supreme Court heard regents of the University of California versus Bank. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  At the time, UC Davis reserved just 16 out of every 100 admissions spots for qualified [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=203.16s)]
*  minority students. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=209.72s)]
*  Alan Bake, a white man, was denied admissions by the university's medical school despite [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=211.04s)]
*  having higher test scores than some minority students admitted that year. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=215.4s)]
*  And he sued. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  And ultimately, the Supreme Court decided that the quota system UC Davis used was unconstitutional. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=221.24s)]
*  But it also ruled that schools did have a, quote, compelling interest in the educational [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=227.36s)]
*  benefits of having a diverse student body, which allowed them to consider race in the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=232.94s)]
*  admissions process, so long as it was one of many factors they were considering. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, conservatives, of course, were outraged and spent decades shopping for the perfect [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  self-described victim of affirmative action to bring future challenges. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  2003, for example, conservative activists seized upon white people who were denied admissions [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  to the University of Michigan and presented Gratz versus Bollinger and Grutter versus [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=258.68s)]
*  Bollinger before the court. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=263.52s)]
*  Those decisions narrowed affirmative action policy slightly, making it illegal to use [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=265.68s)]
*  point-based systems with regard to race in college admissions. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=270.28s)]
*  Yet in the end, the court again reaffirmed the constitutionality of the broader policy. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=274.32s)]
*  So conservatives tried in 2013 and in 2016 with a white woman named Abigail Fisher, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=280.44s)]
*  who was denied admission to the University of Texas. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=286.2s)]
*  Again and again, the court ruled affirmative action was constitutional. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority at the time, stated that the attainment of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=294.64s)]
*  a diverse student body serves values beyond race alone, including enhanced classroom dialogue [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=298.36s)]
*  and the lessening of racial isolation and stereotypes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=303.72s)]
*  Affirmative action was both constitutional and a force for broader societal good that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=307.76s)]
*  cannot be denied. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  But conservatives, well, they went back to the drawing board, continued shopping for [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  the perfect plaintiffs, and returned to the court this past term with two cases, Students [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=320.04s)]
*  for Fair Admissions versus President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=325.18s)]
*  Fair Admissions versus the University of North Carolina. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=328.74s)]
*  By the way, that group named in both of those cases Students for Fair Admissions, well, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=333.58s)]
*  it's a right-wing activist group. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=340.02s)]
*  Its lawyers argued that admissions programs at Harvard and UNC violated the Equal Protection [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=341.62s)]
*  Clause of the 14th Amendment by discriminating against Asian-American applicants and providing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=345.8s)]
*  favorable treatment to students from other minority backgrounds. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=351.44s)]
*  And finally, John Roberts and his extreme colleagues said, enough deciding to end affirmative [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=355.68s)]
*  action as we know it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=361.4s)]
*  So this try and try again mentality, honestly, it's not going anywhere. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=363.8s)]
*  As we said earlier, those of us who breathe a sigh of relief after the Supreme Court didn't [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=369.72s)]
*  end American democracy this past week with the Moore versus Harper ruling, well, they [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  shouldn't rest easy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=379.8s)]
*  If we know anything, it's this conservative activist court has demonstrated time and time [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=381.36s)]
*  again, in fact, too many times now, that settled law isn't really settled in their eyes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  It's just settled for the moment, not forever. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=393.2s)]
*  And there will be another more perfect case to threaten democracy soon enough in this [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=398.2s)]
*  country. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEEorj2kyvs&t=402.84s)]
