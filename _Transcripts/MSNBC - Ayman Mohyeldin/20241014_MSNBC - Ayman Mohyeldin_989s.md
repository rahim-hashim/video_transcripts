Video Description: With just three weeks until the election, a new NBC News poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump tied at 48%. So how has the race gotten this close?

# 'A wake-up call for Democrats': NBC News poll shows Trump, Harris in dead heat
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ)
*  We are just a little more than three weeks away until Election Day, and as of today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the race has become a dead heat. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=4.84s)]
*  New NBC News polling released today has the race tied with Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=6.84s)]
*  and Donald Trump, both at 48 percent nationally among registered voters. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=11.08s)]
*  It's a noticeable drop from last month's NBC poll that had Harris leading Trump by five [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=16.0s)]
*  points. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=20.72s)]
*  Now, the comparison couldn't be more stark compared to the last time an incumbent vice [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=21.72s)]
*  president ran for the top of the ticket. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=25.72s)]
*  At this point in 2000, then Vice President Al Gore had a 60 percent approval rating [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=28.28s)]
*  compared to Harris's now 43 percent. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=33.28s)]
*  And while Gore won the popular vote, the infamous Bush versus Gore ruling from the Supreme Court [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=36.44s)]
*  allowed Bush to win the Electoral College. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=41.36s)]
*  So how did we get here? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  How is the race this close? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=45.6s)]
*  After all, Trump has been opting out of debates in favor of interviews with podcast bros, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=48.0s)]
*  nonsensically about circles, even appearing at Coachella yesterday of all places in his [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=54.4s)]
*  last-minute Hail Mary strategy for blue states. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, Harris has been acting like a presidential candidate. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=63.08s)]
*  She has been holding town halls with voters. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=67.36s)]
*  She has spent all of last week going on a heavy-duty media blitz. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=69.52s)]
*  But what if that's part of the problem? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=74.4s)]
*  What if adhering to presidential norms is the thing that is hurting her campaign? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=76.96s)]
*  After all, Harris has positioned herself as a new candidate for the future. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  We've heard tonight two very different visions for our country, one that is focused on the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=84.56s)]
*  future and the other that is focused on the past. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=92.12s)]
*  It's time to turn the page. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=95.28s)]
*  America is ready for a new way forward. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=97.28s)]
*  I believe in my soul and heart the American people are ready to turn the page. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  It was a message anxious Democrat voters needed and wanted to hear after Joe Biden finally [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  caved to pressure and dropped out of the race. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=114.0s)]
*  But since then, she hasn't distanced herself from Joe Biden. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  She's held on tight to him and his policies. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=119.88s)]
*  In fact, here she is in just two different interviews in the past few days. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=123.08s)]
*  Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=129.56s)]
*  There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of most of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=135.24s)]
*  the decisions that have had impact. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=141.52s)]
*  What would the major changes be and what would stay the same? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=144.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm obviously not Joe Biden. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  Also, I think it's important to say with, you know, 28 days to go, I'm not Donald Trump. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=150.4s)]
*  I'm not Joe Biden, but I'm not Donald Trump. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=156.72s)]
*  The problem is that distinction may not be enough for voters. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  The closer she has kept herself to Biden's unpopular policies, especially on Gaza, the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=163.48s)]
*  more harmful it has been for her campaign. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=167.76s)]
*  And instead of meeting with leaders of the uncommitted movement, for example, to ease [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=170.12s)]
*  their concerns about Israel's assault on Gaza, to create daylight between his stance and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=173.92s)]
*  on the war and hers on the war, Harris is instead touting the support of Republicans [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=179.52s)]
*  like Liz Cheney. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=184.2s)]
*  She's even promised to convene a bipartisan council of advisors, including Republicans [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=185.64s)]
*  on policy, should she win. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=189.72s)]
*  Now, compare the vice president's position today to that of a complete political novice, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=191.64s)]
*  Donald Trump, back in 2016. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=196.16s)]
*  Eight years ago, when voters didn't know how he would govern, they still voted him [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=198.24s)]
*  into office. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=202.76s)]
*  Today, his supporters know exactly who he is and who he'll be as president, so much [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=203.76s)]
*  so that according to USA Today's David Jackson, Trump is polling better today than he was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=209.48s)]
*  back in 2016 and 2020. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=215.24s)]
*  Now, this poll should serve as a wake up call for Democrats. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=218.12s)]
*  There is one silver lining here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=221.88s)]
*  That same NBC News poll shows abortion is the top motivating issue at 22 percent above [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=223.4s)]
*  immigration, protecting democracy and the cost of living. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=228.6s)]
*  It's an issue Harris has been able to successfully campaign on, making herself a concise and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=231.96s)]
*  clear messenger for reproductive rights in this country. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=237.44s)]
*  With Trump, we know what we're getting. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=241.64s)]
*  He stands for fascism, authoritarianism, mass deportations of immigrants, so much so [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=243.92s)]
*  that his former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired General Mark Milley, has [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  referred to him as fascist to the core. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  So the question for Democrats in the last stretch remains, what are you for? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=258.44s)]
*  What is Vice President Kamala Harris for, and will that be enough to stop Donald Trump's [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=263.44s)]
*  authoritarian vision for this country? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  We have an all-star panel to break this down for us. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=271.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Amisha Cross, Democratic strategist and former Obama campaign advisor. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=273.0s)]
*  Tom Nichols, staff writer for The Atlantic, and Wajahat Ali, the co-host of Democracy-ish [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  and author of the book, Go Back Where You Came From and Other Helpful Recommendations [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  on How to Become American. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=287.0s)]
*  It's great to have all three of you with us. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=289.12s)]
*  Amisha, I'll start with you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=290.44s)]
*  What is your understanding? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=292.72s)]
*  How do you explain, how do you decipher the fact that this race is as close as it is when [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=293.72s)]
*  we know who Donald Trump is, what he has done, what he represents, and what he is promising [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=298.52s)]
*  to do? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=302.76s)]
*  Well, I think that it's explained because the voters know all those things as well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=303.76s)]
*  We are in a hyper-polarized American culture. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=308.48s)]
*  We are in one that is buoyed by disinformation and misinformation on a regular basis, specifically [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=310.96s)]
*  those who are utilizing social media and things like YouTube as their top reliable news source. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=317.8s)]
*  We're also seeing more and more people who are latching on to this anti-immigrant xenophobic [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=324.96s)]
*  sentiment. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=329.36s)]
*  That isn't something that's holistically just American. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=330.36s)]
*  We saw it with the Break for Brexit in Europe as well. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=332.44s)]
*  We're seeing time and time again that some of these very dark, categorically ridiculous [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=335.68s)]
*  commentaries about immigrants, migrants specifically, are being touted by the right but are also [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=341.96s)]
*  being eaten up by individuals who should, quite frankly, know better. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=347.32s)]
*  But in addition to that, I think that it's also because, again, America's original sin [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  is racism. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=355.0s)]
*  America has a habit of going back to its mean, and unfortunately we've seen with this do-nothing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=356.68s)]
*  Congress as it's been touted multiple times over, but they have done something. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=360.56s)]
*  The Republican Congress has done a lot of something when it comes to the House specifically. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=363.56s)]
*  They've worked strategically to dismantle civil rights. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=367.4s)]
*  They've worked to strip people of their very humanity, specifically people who look like [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=370.32s)]
*  me and people who are brown across this country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  I think that we have to understand where we are as a nation and where we're going, and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=375.96s)]
*  Donald Trump tapped into something that America has had for quite some time, a refusal to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=379.72s)]
*  accept the multiculturalism that exists here. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think that that is represented very strongly in somebody like Kamala Harris running. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=387.36s)]
*  She represents that multiculturalism. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=391.76s)]
*  She represents diversity. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=393.48s)]
*  She represents and obviously is a woman. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  And there is a healthy bit of misogyny that is really unfortunate going on across this [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=397.12s)]
*  country as well. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  All of those things come to bear this election cycle, and I think that's why we're seeing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=403.2s)]
*  the polls be extremely tight. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  Tom, same question to you, but before I get you to answer, let me play for you, Michael [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  Tyler, the communications director for the Harris campaign. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=412.48s)]
*  He was just on with my colleague, the Reverend Al Sharpton earlier, to react to this new [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=416.24s)]
*  poll. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=419.8s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=420.8s)]
*  This is going to be a margin of error race down until November 5th. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  For us as a campaign, down the final stretch here, it's about using every tool that we [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=427.16s)]
*  have at our disposal to reach those voters that are going to ultimately decide the pathway [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=431.44s)]
*  to 270 electoral votes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=436.48s)]
*  So the word that I'm interested in there, Tom, and feel free to take this however you [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=438.96s)]
*  want, is reach voters as opposed to activate voters or mobilize voters or inspire voters. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=442.84s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that's the right strategy at this point so close to the race, trying [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=449.4s)]
*  to appeal to undecided, if there are any undecided voters. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=452.72s)]
*  I don't personally believe there are left in this country, but trying to reach people [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=456.2s)]
*  who still may not know who they're going to vote for as opposed to really energize those [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=459.76s)]
*  who want to vote for you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the notion that you've got to reach these voters and somehow that there's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=467.28s)]
*  one more thing Kamala Harris says that's finally going to press the lever and change the outcome. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=472.92s)]
*  And I think part of the problem is that there are millions of voters who are still thinking [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=482.88s)]
*  that this is just a normal election and that the outcome isn't that serious. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=491.8s)]
*  And that includes, I think, people that know Donald Trump is dangerous. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=497.08s)]
*  They know he's terrible, but still can't bring themselves to think about not vote, leave [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=501.08s)]
*  aside voting for Kamala Harris, can't bring themselves to not vote for the Republican [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=505.64s)]
*  candidate. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  I also think that that problem of energizing voters is something that bedevils the Democratic [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=511.47999999999996s)]
*  Party. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=520.48s)]
*  For example, if you had the youth vote, if you had a reliable kind of turnout among [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=522.32s)]
*  typical Democratic constituencies, the election would be over. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=529.6s)]
*  But this is always the problem that Democrats go through, where people say, well, I'm not [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=533.6s)]
*  excited to vote and I haven't really been paying attention. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=537.24s)]
*  Republicans are always excited to vote. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  They are always motivated. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=542.2s)]
*  They pay close attention and they vote every single time. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=543.48s)]
*  And that's how we end up with minority rule in this country, because we have a majority. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=547.56s)]
*  Donald Trump will not win a majority of the popular vote again. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=553.88s)]
*  He's going to try and thread the needle through two or three states. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=556.72s)]
*  And we're going to end up with minority rule because so many Democratic voters just can't [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=560.06s)]
*  bring themselves to get organized and go vote. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=565.0s)]
*  And that's really a tragedy. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=568.14s)]
*  Waj, Tom brings up such an important point about the energy factor here and Republicans [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=569.88s)]
*  have it, Democrats don't have it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=575.8199999999999s)]
*  It was one thing to say people didn't know who Donald Trump would be as president back [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=577.08s)]
*  in 2016. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=580.88s)]
*  He's only gotten worse since then. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=582.32s)]
*  I mean, here he is today on Fox escalating his dangerous rhetoric. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=592.08s)]
*  And I think they're the big and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=596.24s)]
*  national guard or if really necessary by the military. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=600.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, six, six stuff talking about the enemy from within code for we know what he means [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=604.5999999999999s)]
*  by all of that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=609.76s)]
*  He's pulling better today than he did in 2016 and 2020. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=610.76s)]
*  A, how do you explain that? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=614.3599999999999s)]
*  And is it a mistake for Democrats to move to the center, try to win the center as opposed [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=616.1999999999999s)]

*  The hoods are off. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=630.64s)]
*  Trump has gone full fascist, full Nazi, full racist. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=631.64s)]
*  It's always been this way. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=634.48s)]
*  People just didn't pay attention because they wanted to chalk it up to economic anxiety. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=636.16s)]
*  It's not economic anxiety. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=640.0s)]
*  For the last past nine years, we have seen that more that Trump is cruel, hateful, xenophobic, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=641.16s)]
*  misogynistic, anti-Semitic. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=645.88s)]

*  His base adores him and we cannot normalize it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=649.48s)]
*  Corporate media cannot normalize it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=652.44s)]
*  Our establishment cannot normalize it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  And especially when General Milley calls him a total fascist, pay attention to him. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=655.2s)]
*  They don't pay attention to you or me. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=659.12s)]

*  Who are we? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=661.64s)]

*  Listen to General Milley calling him a total fascist. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=664.8s)]
*  I think for Democrats, they have to stop being timid. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  Go straight to the mattresses. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=669.56s)]

*  Tell people about the threat he represents to our freedom, for our democracies, on all [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=678.8s)]
*  those issues, on abortion. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=681.88s)]

*  When it comes to healthcare, he has no plan. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=686.48s)]
*  He will take away your Social Security. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=688.28s)]
*  This man is an authoritarian and uses his own quotes against him and then going to the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=689.98s)]

*  They'll bear hug Liz Cheney and they'll drop kick Rashida Tlaib. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=696.46s)]
*  I think they should lean in, expand the pie by going for a bold progressive message and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=700.02s)]

*  There's no need for Tim Walz to sit there and go JD Vance, I agree with you. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=709.4200000000001s)]
*  No, go against him. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=712.82s)]

*  So this is why, Aiman, they need to make that bold case because Amisha was right. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=722.76s)]
*  We're dealing with disinformation in a right wing ecosystem that is beholden to these lies [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=727.14s)]
*  while Republicans right now are willing to kill themselves because they believe Donald [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=731.6800000000001s)]
*  Trump and his conspiracy theories during a hurricane that is killing the Republican base. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=734.64s)]

*  Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=742.86s)]
*  Amisha, Democrats could take solace, should take solace that reproductive rights is the [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=745.04s)]
*  top rated issue for the NBC poll that we showed earlier. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=751.08s)]
*  The vice president has been a great communicator and advocate on that issue. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=755.44s)]
*  To watch his point, what do Democrats need to do to capitalize on that in these last [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=760.9s)]
*  few weeks to make it again front and center to mobilize people within the left and the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=765.4s)]
*  right to vote on this issue? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=770.26s)]
*  We need to put names and faces to it, bring out women and families in the battleground [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  states who have been affected, those who have had to travel to other places, those who could [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=776.7800000000001s)]
*  not travel to other places. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=780.38s)]
*  They've got to be able to name and shame the conservatives who are leading this movement, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=782.1s)]
*  but they've also got to put a heart to it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=786.62s)]
*  And I say that in full recognition that the message of this affecting black women and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=788.58s)]
*  affecting women in poverty at greater rates than anybody else because those are the people [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=792.94s)]
*  who can't afford to leave are not going to always be moving those middle class, those [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=796.46s)]
*  middle class white women voters. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=801.34s)]
*  What will move them is other middle class white women voters who are going through this [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=802.86s)]
*  at the same time, those people who have to understand that when they say that there are [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=805.4599999999999s)]
*  exceptions, you know who's deciding those exceptions? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=809.5799999999999s)]
*  An elected official, not your doctor. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=811.9399999999999s)]
*  So that means you could be up to and including risk of losing your reproductive organs or [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=813.54s)]
*  reproductive capacity completely and on the verge of death. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=818.18s)]
*  And the person who makes that decision who is not comfortable doing so would have been [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=822.3399999999999s)]
*  your doctor because now they've criminalized that doctor and he's up to and including possibly [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=825.9399999999999s)]
*  giving a felony charge for trying to save your life. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=830.02s)]
*  Make it plain for people in real time. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=832.66s)]
*  Get the young people who have been victims of rape and incest to be some of your spokespeople [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=835.1s)]
*  as well. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=839.42s)]
*  They've got to paint this picture in a way that showcases exactly the detriment that [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=840.42s)]
*  these anti-abortionists are causing up to and including trying to get rid of all forms [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=844.34s)]
*  of birth control because that is the Republican main strategy. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=848.54s)]
*  Tom, your former Republican, I'm sure it is encouraging for you to see the vice president [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=851.46s)]
*  like Liz Cheney to show her bipartisanship and the threat that Donald Trump poses to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=856.94s)]
*  this country. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=860.86s)]
*  But do you think that may turn off younger Democratic voters who are not enthralled with [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=861.86s)]
*  any of these key figures of the Republican Party? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=867.5s)]
*  I'm going to maybe start a food fight here because I disagree with a lot of this. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=871.2600000000001s)]
*  The last thing the Democratic Party needs is more Rashida Tlaib. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=874.46s)]
*  And I don't think it's bad that Harris is embracing Liz Cheney. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=878.58s)]
*  I do agree, however, and I agree with Wajahat about this, especially with Walz and Vance, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=883.26s)]
*  that, you know, trying to show all that common ground during the debate. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=888.22s)]
*  The problem is that Harris was running really well by not taking the bait from journalists [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=892.94s)]
*  about you've got to show how you're different from Biden. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  You have to tell us about your housing plan. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=902.26s)]
*  You have to give us all the wonky details. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=903.78s)]
*  And you notice that Trump has wisely just faded out. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=906.7s)]
*  Ducking another debate was smart because debates hurt Trump. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=911.7s)]
*  And as a result, we end up talking about what's Harris's strategy? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=916.6600000000001s)]
*  Why aren't young voters more energized? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=919.46s)]
*  Well, maybe because we're not talking about the fact that Donald Trump this morning talked [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeviZX8zjQ&t=922.82s)]
