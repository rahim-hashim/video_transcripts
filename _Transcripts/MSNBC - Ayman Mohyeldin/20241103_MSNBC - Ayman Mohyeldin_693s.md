# Leaked videos of Project 2025 architect reveal planned MAGA takeover of federal government
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4)
*  Tonight, Vice President Kamala Harris is delivering a dire warning to Americans who might still [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=0.0s)]
*  be on the fence about who to vote for on Election Day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=5.84s)]
*  This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  This is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=15.4s)]
*  and the man is out for unchecked power. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  And in less than 90 days, is he going to be him or me in the Oval Office? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=29.76s)]
*  Now this comes as we see Donald Trump on defense after using what little time he has to deliver [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=40.08s)]
*  a closing message to attack former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=45.24s)]
*  It's a fake news and they're trying to make something out of it and it's so biased to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=50.2s)]
*  start off with. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=55.28s)]
*  All I'm saying is she was a nutty war hawk. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=56.52s)]
*  She wants to go to war with anybody that moves and lose a lot of people, lose a lot of soldiers, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=59.56s)]
*  put the nation in trouble. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=65.2s)]
*  Now I want to play the comments that sparked intense backlash. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=67.72s)]
*  Here is Trump speaking at an event in Arizona with Tucker Carlson on Thursday. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  She's a radical war hawk. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=78.84s)]
*  Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  Let's see how she feels about it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=85.4s)]
*  You know, when the guns are trained on her face. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  You know, they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  oh gee, Will, let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=94.92s)]
*  But she's a stupid person. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=101.48s)]
*  Trump maintains that he was simply criticizing Cheney for being a war hawk. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=104.28s)]
*  Arizona Attorney General Chris Mays, slightly different interpretation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  She has announced an investigation into Trump's comments as potential death threats against [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=112.72s)]
*  Liz Cheney. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=117.88s)]
*  It is no wonder Trump's remarks have been so divisive. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=118.88s)]
*  After all, he has regularly used violent rhetoric to talk about his perceived adversaries. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=121.32s)]
*  And this comes as we are learning more about secret plans for a MAGA takeover of the federal [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=127.56s)]
*  government if Trump reclaims the White House. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=132.24s)]
*  Like most things in Trump world, it all leads back to Project 2025. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=135.2s)]
*  Earlier this week, ProPublica and Documented released a report which uncovered shocking [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=141.2s)]
*  videos of private speeches delivered by this guy, Russell Vogt. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=147.16s)]
*  He is a Chief Project 2025 architect and the president of the far right think tank, the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=151.72s)]
*  Center for Renewing America. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=157.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=159.12s)]
*  We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=164.92s)]
*  are increasingly viewed as the villains. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=170.72s)]
*  We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=173.6s)]
*  our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  We want to put them in trauma. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  We're trying to build a shadow office of legal counsel so that when a future president says, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=186.44s)]
*  what legal authorities do I need to shut down the riots, we want to be able to shut down [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=192.4s)]
*  the riots and not have the legal community or the defense community to come in and say [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=198.6s)]
*  that's an inappropriate use of what you're trying to do. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=203.0s)]
*  Vogt, who has remained a close ally of Trump since leaving government, went on to call [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=206.6s)]
*  these plans a response to the quote, Marxist takeover of the United States. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=212.76s)]
*  He also likened this moment in history to 1776 and 1860, you know, when the US was at [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=217.84s)]
*  war or on the brink of war. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  This is the extreme framework Vogt and MAGA leaders are pushing over and over and over [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=227.64s)]
*  again and there is good reason to believe that this is much more than just rhetoric. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=233.48s)]
*  Back in August, ProPublica and Documented shared previously unpublished training videos [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=238.4s)]
*  training future political appointees in a hypothetical Trump administration and offering [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=243.32s)]
*  advice on how to change the way the federal government functions. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=248.24s)]
*  According to a ProPublica review, 29 of the 36 speakers featured in that training video [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=252.84s)]
*  or those training videos have worked for Trump in some capacity. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=258.8s)]
*  And then there's everything we have heard from Trump himself. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=263.28s)]
*  According to an NBC News review of Trump's public comments, he has called for the criminal [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=266.52s)]
*  prosecution of 16 politicians, 15 law enforcement, military and intelligence officials, just [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=270.8s)]
*  since he entered the 2024 race. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=278.36s)]
*  He has also threatened the prosecution of workers, of federal public health agencies, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=281.46s)]
*  tech billionaires, and basically anyone who engages in what he has called, quote, unscrupulous [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=286.29999999999995s)]
*  behavior. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=290.9s)]
*  But the question is, could Trump actually carry out unprecedented prosecutions? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=291.9s)]
*  Well, NBC News asked current and former Justice Department and FBI officials and a group of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=297.29999999999995s)]
*  legal experts that very same question. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=302.58s)]
*  And they all said, yes, there are ways around the guardrails, even though doing so would [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=305.02s)]
*  shatter half a century of post-Watergate norms in this country. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=310.54s)]
*  For starters, a new president appoints about 300 senior Justice Department officials, including [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=315.54s)]
*  powerful positions and U.S. attorneys who ultimately run offices across the country. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=320.58s)]
*  All 300 of those appointees must be confirmed by the Senate. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=325.54s)]
*  But multiple former officials said they fear Trump would install partisans who are willing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=328.58s)]
*  to do his bidding. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=333.74s)]
*  According to ABC News, one of the names on a draft list of people Trump might nominate [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=335.62s)]
*  is Attorney General is, you might recognize her, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=339.9s)]
*  She is the one who, of course, threw out the classified documents case against him in Florida. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=346.18s)]
*  Also on the list, this guy, Jeffrey Clark, a mid-level Justice Department official who [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=350.97999999999996s)]
*  backed Trump's claims of 2020 election fraud. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  Of course, you'll remember that days before the January 6th insurrection, Trump attempted [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=357.5s)]
*  and luckily failed to install Clark as the acting attorney general at the time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=362.94s)]
*  Speaking of acting attorney generals, Trump's more hard-line advisors have discussed appointing [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=367.94s)]
*  a series of them since they wouldn't require confirmation from the Senate. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=373.86s)]
*  In fact, under current federal law, an acting attorney general can serve up to 210 days [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=378.18s)]
*  at a time. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=383.86s)]
*  And it doesn't end there. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=385.58s)]
*  One of Trump's more far-reaching proposals, Schedule F, calls for the reclassification [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=386.58s)]
*  of about 50,000 civil servants across the federal government. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=392.26s)]
*  In other words, they could be hired, promoted, and fired at the whims of Donald Trump and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=396.14000000000004s)]
*  his inner circle. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  Even if Trump never took action on Schedule F, officials and experts said the likely outcome [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  of this level of upheaval would be an even more extreme version of the chaos and legal [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=407.26s)]
*  battles that marked his first term. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=412.66s)]
*  So what is the big takeaway here? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  Don't call Donald Trump, potentially in a second term, a comeback. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's call it what it is. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=423.70000000000005s)]
*  It would be a revenge tour that Trump and his allies have spent years meticulously planning [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=425.22s)]
*  and telling us about. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=431.02000000000004s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this, Molly-Jung Fast, MSNBC political analyst, host of the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=432.62s)]
*  Fast Politics podcast and special correspondent for Vanity Fair. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=436.14000000000004s)]
*  Charles Coleman Jr., MSNBC legal analyst, former prosecutor and host of the Charles [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=439.74s)]
*  Coleman podcast. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=443.8s)]
*  And Jason Stanley, professor of philosophy at Yale University. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=445.14000000000004s)]
*  He is, of course, the author of Erasing History, How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=448.22s)]
*  Future. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=453.42s)]
*  Thanks for having us, and thanks for the interview in person here. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=454.74s)]
*  Molly, your reaction to what is happening, I would argue, in plain sight. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=456.78000000000003s)]
*  It may not get the national attention that it gets. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=461.42s)]
*  People go about their lives. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=464.38s)]
*  A lot of people thought after 2020 that Trump chapter is over. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=465.38s)]
*  They stopped paying attention to the votes of the world or the Steve Bannons of the world [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=470.18s)]
*  thinking we had dodged a bullet. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=473.38s)]
*  And yet here we are four years later now going back, listening to these tapes, finding these [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=475.02000000000004s)]
*  comments where they are telling us in plain sight how they want to remake the American [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=479.06s)]
*  government in their vision. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=483.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=484.24s)]
*  So Project 2025 operates from the theory that the first Trump administration was a failure [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=485.24s)]
*  because they were not able to remake the federal government the way they want to. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  So a lot of the stuff you're hearing about is this idea of firing all of the federal [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=495.56s)]
*  employees, making them schedule F. And the goal here is really to shrink the federal [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=500.68s)]
*  government, get rid of things like the Department of Education, which Trump has mused about, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=505.96s)]
*  and the EPA and NOAA and a lot of the government services that are nonpartisan, scientific, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=510.96s)]
*  you know, et cetera. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=517.56s)]
*  And then to get rid of really all the nonpartisan employees in the federal government. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=518.68s)]
*  Remember, there are tens of thousands of people who work in the federal government and install [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=523.84s)]
*  them with loyalists. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=528.12s)]
*  So it's part of it is really to make the federal government an arm of the Trump campaign, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=529.12s)]
*  right, to make the DOJ serve the pleasure of Donald Trump. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=535.0s)]
*  And you'll remember the Supreme Court last season gave him this very vague sort of immunity [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=539.36s)]
*  that he could sort of use for anything he wants and that is so unstructured that he [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  really could just do anything with it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=549.72s)]
*  Jason, the scary part in all of this is, as Molly was saying, they went through the dry [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=553.24s)]
*  run from 2016 to 2020. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=559.48s)]
*  They now have a blueprint and certainly a playbook. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=562.12s)]
*  I mean, Jay, you've got Doug Vogt here talking about creating a shadow legal counsel, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=564.6800000000001s)]
*  traumatically affecting bureaucrats going after them. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=571.12s)]
*  You know, everything Trumpism infects becomes infested. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=575.76s)]
*  You look at his takeover of the Republican Party. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=581.0s)]
*  We thought at some point the Republican Party would be able to withstand him and stand up [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  to him. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=586.4s)]
*  That has not happened. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=587.4s)]
*  He has completely infested the party with his ideology and it now has become a cult of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=588.4s)]
*  Donald Trump and now he wants to do that to the federal government. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=593.6s)]
*  Yeah, you said the scary part. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=596.52s)]
*  I think there are many scary parts here. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=598.64s)]
*  I agree with Russell Vogt that it is a historical moment, but it's not 1776, it's 1932. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  This is just the perfect blueprint of National Socialism circa 1932. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=609.16s)]
*  What they're doing is called Gleichschaltung, what the Nazis call Gleichschaltung, which [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=616.88s)]
*  is replacement of all agencies by loyalists, by Nazi Party members, Nazi Party loyalists. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=620.96s)]
*  So you replace everyone. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=628.32s)]
*  This tactic, rhetorical tactic of calling centrist Democrats, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=631.24s)]
*  centrist Democrats, Marxists, is exactly what the National Socialists did. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=638.32s)]
*  The idea that there's a Marxist takeover of the United States is one of the more absurd [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=643.48s)]
*  ideas floating around today, but what it's going to justify is targeting political opponents [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=649.52s)]
*  as national enemies. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=657.24s)]
*  And that's what the National Socialists did. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=659.84s)]
*  The first people they targeted were the Social Democrats, the moderates, and they said they [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=661.52s)]
*  are dangerous Marxists and they imprisoned them. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's kind of the playbook that it looks like now. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXP0zSSKFM4&t=669.64s)]
