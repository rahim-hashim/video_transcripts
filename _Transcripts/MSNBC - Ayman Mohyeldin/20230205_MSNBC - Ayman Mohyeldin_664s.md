# State Attorneys General Panel on Police Reform, Election Integrity, Abortion
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE)
*  As of this year, seven states now have black men and women as their top law enforcement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=0.0s)]
*  officers, state attorneys general. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  It is a record, and that progress deserves to be celebrated. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=10.96s)]
*  And yet, it comes at a time when broader racial progress still seems uneven at best, because [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=14.4s)]
*  it is a time, or at a time, when other black men and women are dying unnecessarily at the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=20.32s)]
*  hands of police officers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=25.7s)]
*  This week, Tyree Nichols, the 29-year-old black man who was brutally beaten by Memphis [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=27.86s)]
*  police officers, was laid to rest. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=31.9s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at Tyree Nichols' funeral. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=34.7s)]
*  As vice president of the United States, we demand that Congress pass the George Floyd [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=39.6s)]
*  Justice and Policing Act. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=45.9s)]
*  Joe Biden will sign it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=48.18s)]
*  And we should not delay. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  And we will not be denied. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=55.54s)]
*  It is non-negotiable. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=57.86s)]
*  Now there is a clear contrast between the initial police report on Tyree Nichols and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=61.26s)]
*  what we saw on police body camera footage. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=67.14s)]
*  Four of the five officers charged in the death of Tyree Nichols had prior work violations. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=70.38s)]
*  His killing was unnecessary. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=75.2s)]
*  It was unjust. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=76.9s)]
*  And it is a reminder of the ongoing systemic issues with policing that remain in our country. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=78.86s)]
*  Tonight, I am honored to be joined by three state attorneys general from around the United [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  States to discuss this issue and much more. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=90.41999999999999s)]
*  Andrea Campbell of Massachusetts, Andrew Foer, Aaron Foer, excuse me, of Nevada, and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=93.66s)]
*  Kwame Raul of Illinois. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=98.14s)]
*  Attorneys general, it's great to have all three of you with us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  Andrea, I'd like to start with you, if I can. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=103.66s)]
*  In your statement about Tyree Nichols' death, you wrote about the tremendous work needed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=106.86s)]
*  to address corruption, police brutality, and racial injustice. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=111.22s)]
*  Talk to us about how you and your community members are doing on that front and what work [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=116.26s)]
*  would you like to see done to address police violence? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=121.58s)]
*  First of all, thank you for having me and it's great to be on with my colleagues who, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=124.46s)]
*  of course, have been doing the work for a long time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=129.46s)]
*  We all didn't need to see another video to know that we still need transparency and accountability [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=132.86s)]
*  in our policing systems and our criminal legal systems. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=138.74s)]
*  In my past work as a local counselor in the city of Boston, worked on making sure our [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  officers were equipped with body cameras. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=146.46s)]
*  We now have a civilian review board in the city of Boston to review incidents of misconduct. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  At the state level, we have a post system where an officer can be decertified based [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=156.0s)]
*  on certain behavior. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=160.86s)]
*  But as attorney general, I have pledged to create a police accountability unit within [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=162.78s)]
*  the office. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=166.8s)]
*  That is critically important because even though in Massachusetts we have not seen an [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  incident quite at the scale and magnitude related to Tyree Nichols, there is still tremendous [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=172.02s)]
*  work to do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=179.02s)]
*  There are still folks who are being racially profiled. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=180.02s)]
*  There are folks, of course, who have had unfortunate incidents with police officers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  And there's still a lot more work to do to ensure our systems have processes within them [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  to hold officers accountable when something goes terribly wrong. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=193.34s)]
*  We're all doing the work of diversifying our state agencies and making sure they're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=196.7s)]
*  transparent and accountable to the people they serve. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  Aaron, you said that law enforcement must listen to the pain of the community. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=203.38s)]
*  Why do you think they are not listening? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  I mean, with everything that we have seen with police violence, it seems there are still [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=210.7s)]
*  police departments that are not listening to these communities and their pain. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=215.98s)]
*  What is your understanding of why that is not happening? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=220.76s)]
*  Well, listen, I think that the lines of communication certainly have to open up, remain open in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=224.3s)]
*  certain instances here in Nevada, similar to what has happened in Massachusetts. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=229.66000000000003s)]
*  We've made great strides in trying to improve relationships between law enforcement and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=233.62s)]
*  the communities that we serve. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  I say we because I'm a part of law enforcement. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  And so what we've done is passed, for example, bills that have a duty to intervene and that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=240.82000000000002s)]
*  when an officer sees bad things happening to one of our residents or one of our citizenry, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=245.86s)]
*  they're supposed to intervene and there are repercussions because of that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  We are waiting for the federal government to pass the Justice and Policing Act, the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  George Floyd Act. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=258.78s)]
*  But we have also in our own state, passed pattern and practice investigation authority [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=259.78s)]
*  for my office to allow me to investigate police departments to improve, again, the relationship [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=263.62s)]
*  between law enforcement and the communities that we serve. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=268.78s)]
*  There are certain communities that have no trust at all in law enforcement. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=270.86s)]
*  And frankly, I came from a community like that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=273.86s)]
*  And so what I endeavor to do is to create that trust where it's never existed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=276.3s)]
*  And it begins with listening to the outcry. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=280.58s)]
*  Now, I will say this before I give you the mic back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=283.02s)]
*  We don't have to go to Minneapolis or to Memphis or elsewhere to understand the turmoil that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=285.7s)]
*  is brought between law enforcement and our communities. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  We in our own state have had instances like Byron Williams. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=294.18s)]
*  We've had instances like Jorge Gomez that have undercut the trust in the community between [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=297.86s)]
*  law enforcement and the community. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=303.06s)]
*  And we have to continue to work toward rectifying those issues. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=304.06s)]
*  Aquamit, can you talk to us about how your office works with police officers and precincts [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=307.74s)]
*  in your state? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=311.94s)]
*  What steps would you like to see taken towards accountability? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=312.94s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=316.66s)]
*  So one of the things Andrea mentioned, having a decertification statute. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=317.66s)]
*  I work with police chiefs and sheriffs and state's attorneys to make sure that the decertification [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=326.54s)]
*  statute that we had in our state was enhanced such that we can have an accountability that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  touches things beyond conviction for a felony. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=339.42s)]
*  We know that it's very difficult. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=344.1s)]
*  It's rare that a police officer gets convicted for a felony, even if he or she commits one. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=347.86s)]
*  And so we wanted to make sure that there was accountability in those cases. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=352.94s)]
*  We also added the patterns and practice investigation authority for our office that A.G. Ford mentioned. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  And we advocated for the inclusion of that in the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=366.94s)]
*  that state AGs would have the authority to conduct patterns and practice investigations [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=372.58s)]
*  because the Department of Justice on their own cannot handle it throughout the state. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=378.3s)]
*  We have to work collaboratively with DOJ in order to make sure that we work towards [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=383.66s)]
*  constitutional policing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=388.94s)]
*  Let me change pace for a moment. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=391.38000000000005s)]
*  Attorney General Campbell, you are the first black woman to be elected attorney general [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=393.82000000000005s)]
*  in Massachusetts and the first black woman to any statewide office in your state. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=397.5s)]
*  Talk to me about what it means to you to take on this role at this time and be breaking [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=403.18s)]
*  these barriers. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  I see it as an incredible opportunity. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=410.62s)]
*  I spent my day today actually behind the wall visiting men at a prison here in Massachusetts, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=412.82s)]
*  really speaking to them while I recognize the historic nature of my victory, what it [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=419.14s)]
*  means to them and so many folks across the Commonwealth. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=425.54s)]
*  We still have work to do. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=428.98s)]
*  I'm very faith driven. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=430.42s)]
*  I don't feel as though me being in this role is by accident in this moment in time. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=431.62s)]
*  I was, of course, emotionally overwhelmed by the video of Tyree Nichols. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  But at the same time, it's an opportunity to really address systemic racism that still [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=441.56s)]
*  exists in this country and all of the injustices that we see. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=446.12s)]
*  Most of my life has been connected to a loss in my life has been connected to the prison [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=450.88s)]
*  system. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=455.0s)]
*  All of my biological parents are deceased, my twin brother the same, cycling in another [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=456.0s)]
*  prison system and as a result of being in that system, losing their lives in many ways. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=460.96s)]
*  So this is an opportunity to really deliver for constituents all across Massachusetts, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=466.44s)]
*  but to do it in partnership with folks across the country to address systemic racism and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=471.24s)]
*  racial injustice. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=476.04s)]
*  Attorney General Raul, you've talked about the significance of your position as a black [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=477.92s)]
*  attorney general and having a presence in this space. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=482.8s)]
*  Can you talk to us about how diversity in these leadership roles makes or doesn't make [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  a difference? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  We saw black police officers beating a black man in Memphis, Tennessee. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  The diversity in of itself may not be enough to bring about the reform this country needs. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=495.12s)]
*  Yeah, listen, after the murder of George Floyd, I wrote a letter to my staff and I reflected [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=501.88s)]
*  in that letter my own personal experiences as a black man who was raised on the south [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=509.4s)]
*  side of Chicago, who had my own experiences, unfortunately, with unconstitutional policing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=514.8s)]
*  Being the father of a young black man and a young black female who have had their own [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=523.4s)]
*  encounters. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=530.64s)]
*  And so those lived experiences brought to be through the Office of Chief Legal Officer [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=531.64s)]
*  of the state brings about a perspective that is not had in many other states. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=536.56s)]
*  And that perspective, even within my office and freeing up others in my office to bring [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=545.08s)]
*  their perspectives from their diverse backgrounds, is a healthy thing towards working towards [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=553.04s)]
*  good policy and good enforcement of good policy. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=559.08s)]
*  Mr. Ford, you were the first black attorney general in Nevada. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=562.6s)]
*  Talk about the challenges and the highlights of this office for you as a first as well [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=565.88s)]
*  and what it symbolizes for your state. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, as you say, in my church, I'm blessed and highly favored to be in this position. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  I view it as an honor. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=579.72s)]
*  I view it as an opportunity and I view it as a responsibility to speak truth to power [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=580.72s)]
*  from my position of power. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  Utilizing a voice that is heretofore been unrepresented in this particular office. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=587.28s)]
*  I know we're talking about more than just policing particularly, but in the aftermath [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  of George Floyd as well, I spoke to the issue from a very personal perspective. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=596.24s)]
*  I'm a black man married to a black woman raising three black sons and a black nephew. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=600.6800000000001s)]
*  George Floyd wasn't the first time we had to engage in encountering conversation around [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=605.92s)]
*  the death of a black man at the hands of police. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=610.12s)]
*  It wasn't the last, clearly. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=613.88s)]
*  And so what we look to do in this position is to utilize our position in order to enhance [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=616.12s)]
*  again communication between law enforcement and the communities that we serve and beyond [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=620.5200000000001s)]
*  enhancing communication, enhancing trust. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=624.44s)]
*  And I think that I view this as an opportunity to do exactly that through this position and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=626.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm again blessed and highly favored to be here. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=630.48s)]
*  Aaron, Andrea, Kwame, please stick around. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=632.84s)]
*  We're going to continue this conversation with state attorneys general right after a [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=635.24s)]
*  quick break. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=638.5200000000001s)]
*  Don't go anywhere. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560JrkjVRbE&t=639.5200000000001s)]
