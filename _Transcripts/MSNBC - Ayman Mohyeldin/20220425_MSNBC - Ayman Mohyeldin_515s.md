# Obama Warns That “People Are Dying Because Of Misinformation,” But Is His Warning Coming Too Late?
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo)
*  So, after years of dangerous disinformation being spread on social media, it is time for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=0.0s)]
*  Silicon Valley's unregulated days to end. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=4.92s)]
*  That is the message President Obama delivered to an audience actually at Stanford University [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=8.84s)]
*  just this week, where he said, quote, people are dying because of misinformation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=12.88s)]
*  BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America People like Putin and Steve Bannon, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=17.44s)]
*  for that matter. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=23.56s)]
*  Understand, it's not necessary for people to believe this information in order to weaken [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  democratic institutions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=32.04s)]
*  You just have to flood a country's public square with enough raw sewage. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=35.6s)]
*  You just have to raise enough questions, spread enough dirt, plant enough conspiracy theorizing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=40.32s)]
*  citizens no longer know what to believe. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=51.76s)]
*  Now, I applaud the president's message, but I have to ask, where have you been? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=55.0s)]
*  This is a speech that should have been delivered years ago and not on some random Thursday [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=62.68s)]
*  in April at a California university, but on a platform the whole world would pay attention [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=67.44s)]
*  to. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=73.52s)]
*  Our panel is back with us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=74.52s)]
*  Maya, correct me if I'm wrong here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=76.16s)]
*  Those are my thoughts. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=78.0s)]
*  I'm a firm believer that we have a disinformation pandemic around the world. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=79.24s)]
*  Your reaction to Obama's speech? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=86.04s)]
*  MAYA BARROWS, President, National Department of State, University of California, University [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=87.64s)]
*  of California, University of California, University of California, University of California, University [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=89.64s)]
*  of California, University of California, University of California, University of California, University [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=90.64s)]
*  of California, University of California, University of California, University of California, University [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=91.64s)]
*  of California, University of California, University of California, University of California, University [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=92.64s)]
*  of California, University of California, University of California, University of California, University [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=93.64s)]
*  of California, University of California, University of California, University of California, University [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=94.64s)]
*  of California, University of California, University of California, University of California, University [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=95.64s)]
*  of California, University of California, University of California, University of California, University [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=96.64s)]
*  of California, University of California, University of California, University of California, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=97.64s)]
*  it is an intentional strategy, sadly and unfortunately for our democracy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=99.28s)]
*  And, yes, look, we can always talk about when and how and whether he should have done it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=104.28s)]
*  sooner. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=109.48s)]
*  I think there's a debate there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=110.48s)]
*  I just don't think it's our problem right now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=111.48s)]
*  I think our problem is that we have to now come together as a nation and understand that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=113.24s)]
*  we have disinformation coming from our own elected officials. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=119.16s)]
*  We have a great big lie that too many Americans actually believe are true or might be true, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  that our elections are somehow up for grabs based on conspiracy theories that have no [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=130.76s)]
*  data or support behind them, where we have had Republicans who even worked for the president [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=137.04s)]
*  Donald Trump at Homeland Security, his own attorney general who protected him in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=142.32s)]
*  context of the Mueller probe. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  Yet, we know that they actually told the president that there was simply no facts or evidence [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  of any substantial voter fraud. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=158.16s)]
*  I mean, when we've got those kinds of conditions, I think the message is welcome. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=159.64s)]
*  I think we have to be glad he gave those words. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=164.16s)]
*  I think it's more incumbent on for us to make sure that Congress actually tries to act on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=168.2s)]
*  it, but that actually every state and every municipality does what it can do in the midst [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=173.56s)]
*  of it and not wait for Congress, which is far too broken right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=179.2s)]
*  And the American public that we have a real conversation about how we educate ourselves [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=182.92s)]
*  in order not to fall victim to disinformation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  It does require actually having some good civic engagement training. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=190.48s)]
*  It's time we did that again and stop fighting about history lessons in our schools and what [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=195.32s)]
*  books our children are reading and hope they're reading a lot more of them and that we all [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=199.72s)]
*  understand how this works, because this is fundamental right now to our democracy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  David, Obama, no doubt about it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=209.44s)]
*  President Obama, no doubt about it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=213.04s)]
*  Former President Obama, excuse me, no doubt about it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=214.04s)]
*  One of the greatest orators of the modern era. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=215.72s)]
*  And he acknowledges that he should have recognized the extent of the problem sooner. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  He referenced the 2016 election as a major turning point. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=222.16s)]
*  But it actually goes back longer than that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, in my opinion, it goes back to 2011 when he had Trump spreading the birther conspiracy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=228.92s)]
*  Is that not so? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=233.88s)]
*  It goes back further than that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=235.0s)]
*  It goes back to the Clinton administration when technology companies were given a set [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=237.64s)]
*  of rights that sort of absolved them of responsibility for being the media companies they were. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=243.12s)]
*  And then for year after year after year as they gained power and we saw the power of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=249.2s)]
*  this disinformation and we saw the need for them to self-regulate and they weren't doing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=254.56s)]
*  it, politicians on both sides said, you know, I'm not going to mess with them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=259.88s)]
*  Those guys are pretty rich. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=264.44s)]
*  They could be helpful to me. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=265.52s)]
*  So I think there's plenty of blame to go around here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=267.56s)]
*  And I totally agree with you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=271.6s)]
*  I think that President Obama should have been out there with this earlier. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=272.88s)]
*  But it ties into the point that Maya made. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=277.92s)]
*  It ties into the point from the last segment. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=280.92s)]
*  We can't have a discussion about this politely on Thursday afternoons in lovely academic [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=284.18s)]
*  settings. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=289.68s)]
*  The disinformation that is being put out there ties to the desire to suppress textbook, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=290.68s)]
*  ties to the lies of Republican politicians, ties to the desire to suppress the vote. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=297.92s)]
*  It's all part of an effort to create a false reality in which these Republicans can gain [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=304.92s)]
*  power and keep power indefinitely. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=313.32s)]
*  And that's the reason that President Obama and every Democratic leader ought to be out [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=316.72s)]
*  there on every available platform every day from now until the election sounding the alarm [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=322.4s)]
*  that we are in a critical moment and putting the pieces together, trying to show people [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=330.6s)]
*  how all the pieces of this puzzle fit together in an authoritarian power grab that we never [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=338.88s)]
*  thought was possible in the United States of America. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=346.36s)]
*  Yeah, I completely agree with you on all those points. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  Fernand, Obama addressed Silicon Valley's responsibility. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=354.2s)]
*  I want you to listen to this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  Companies need to be more transparent about how they operate. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  So much of the conversation around disinformation is focused on what people post. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=365.12s)]
*  The bigger issue is what content these platforms promote. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=369.48s)]
*  So a major speech like this is great, no doubt about it, but what more can and should the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=375.36s)]
*  president, former president be doing to tackle this problem with the resources he has, with [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=382.64s)]
*  the platform he has? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=386.8s)]
*  Well, that's really the question, isn't it? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think the burden should just fall on former President Obama. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=391.24s)]
*  You also have former Republican President George W. Bush. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=394.72s)]
*  You have former Democratic President Bill Clinton. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=398.32s)]
*  Bush should be all of the leaders of the country who still have some sort of influence [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=401.36s)]
*  in standing, banding together like David Rothkoff talked about, and talk about the position [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=406.32s)]
*  that the country finds itself in today. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=412.64s)]
*  Very sadly and candidly, I don't think that you are going to be able to stop this disinformation [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=415.56s)]
*  cancer, which has metastasized and been left to grow rampant in time for the 2022 elections. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=420.92s)]
*  Frankly, I doubt we're going to be able to do anything for the 2024 elections, which [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=427.68s)]
*  is why I come back to the point I made earlier. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=431.08s)]
*  We are hanging by the thread with the last line of defense being the rule of law. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  And right now, the rule of law falls firmly in the hands of the Department of Justice [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=439.2s)]
*  and to what they can do to protect election integrity, to what they can do to protect [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=443.88s)]
*  voting rights, and to what they can do to hold accountable the traitors and the saboteurs [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=448.96s)]
*  that Senator Warren talked about and that we all saw act in unison in the run up to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  January 6th and January 6th and then after January 6th, hold them accountable to the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  rule of law. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=464.72s)]
*  If that doesn't happen, Eamon, no amount of legislation on Silicon Valley or no tough [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=466.12s)]
*  worded letters to the CEOs of these companies, I think, will be able to solve and tackle [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  the real problem, which is a democracy that is under assault right now and that is on [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=477.72s)]
*  the brink of being lost if we don't use the rule of law to hold accountable those that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=483.24s)]
*  threatened and tried to overturn the democracy a year and a half ago. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fr89LXNzRo&t=489.72s)]
