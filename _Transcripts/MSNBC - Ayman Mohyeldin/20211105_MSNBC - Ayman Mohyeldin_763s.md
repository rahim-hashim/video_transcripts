# Why Is The U.S. Failing At Affordable Home Covid Testing? | Ayman
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM)
*  I think the bottom line is the end of the end of the pandemic, at least as it relates [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=0.0s)]
*  to the United States is in sight right now, given all the tools we have to combat this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=6.4s)]
*  disease. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=10.88s)]
*  Now, we still have to get through this Delta wave. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=11.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to vaccinate our way out of it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=13.36s)]
*  These therapeutics are coming too late to really affect that wave of infection. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=16.12s)]
*  But once we get through this Delta wave of infection over the course of the next two [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=20.06s)]
*  months, I think that this therapeutic and the other innovations that we've seen coming [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=22.92s)]
*  to market really mark the end of the pandemic for the United States. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=26.16s)]
*  So we need to think about how we put that, you know, victory sign on the side of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=29.4s)]
*  White House, how we declare victory over this pandemic, at least here in the United States. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=33.28s)]
*  So that's Pfizer board member Dr. Scott Gottlieb talking about how we declare victory [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=38.16s)]
*  over the pandemic. Now, his comments came this morning after Pfizer announced that it [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=43.28s)]
*  is stopping a trial for its covid-19 pill after results show that it cuts the risk of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  hospitalization by 89 percent. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=52.36s)]
*  The company will submit data on the therapeutic to the FDA before Thanksgiving. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  But Dr. Gottlieb's optimistic view about the end of the pandemic is actually at odds [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=58.36s)]
*  with others in the scientific community who argue that rather than debate how to end [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=63.28s)]
*  the pandemic, we need to debate how to live with it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=67.28s)]
*  Now, the reality is that any future containing covid involves heavy testing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  But surging demand for covid-19 tests from U.S. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=74.72s)]
*  employers has worsened a nationwide shortage of rapid tests, leading to scarcity and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=77.48s)]
*  high prices. Now, compare that to Europe. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=82.32s)]
*  In Britain, you can get free rapid tests delivered to your house on demand in France, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  Germany and Belgium. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=90.28s)]
*  They're about as expensive as a morning cup of coffee. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=91.6s)]
*  And they're the same ones that we have right here in the United States. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=94.36s)]
*  In fact, one company has a virtual lock on the U.S. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=97.88s)]
*  market. According to Nielsen IQ, Abbott's tests dominate 75 percent of the market. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  How did this happen? You might ask. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=107.32s)]
*  Well, a new report from ProPublica highlights how the U.S. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=108.8s)]
*  dropped the ball on rapid home tests. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=111.8s)]
*  The answer appears to be a confounding combination of overzealous regulation, anemic [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=113.92s)]
*  government support, speed bumps that have defined America's testing response from the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  very beginning of this pandemic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=123.48s)]
*  And the report describes companies painstaking efforts to try and get approval. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=125.4s)]
*  Quote, we spent our own million dollars developing this thing at the FDA's encouragement. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  And then they just treat you like a criminal. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what the head of WHPM, a medical diagnostic manufacturing company, said of his [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=138.08s)]
*  encounters with the FDA. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=143.88s)]
*  They treat you like a criminal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, a separate California Diagnostic Center company described the FDA's unrealistic [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=148.08s)]
*  timelines during the review process. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=153.52s)]
*  While biopharmaceutical giant Roche told ProPublica that its home tests were rejected [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=155.56s)]
*  because the trials had partly been done in Europe. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's be clear about this. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=164.12s)]
*  What's going on with this process is the exact opposite of what Dr. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=165.56s)]
*  Fauci said he wanted back in March. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  They actually have been saying that for months and months and months that we should be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=173.28s)]
*  literally flooding the system with easily accessible, cheap, not needing a prescription [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  point of care, highly sensitive and highly specific. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=185.0s)]
*  Eight months later, the system is literally not flooded with cheap tests. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=190.44000000000003s)]
*  And there were once hopes of quick, easy saliva tests everywhere. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  What happened to those? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=198.2s)]
*  America prides itself on having the greatest health care system in the world. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  But what this investigation lays bare is how the richest country on Earth has lagged the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=203.0s)]
*  world on testing, diagnosing and crucially moving on from this pandemic. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=208.28s)]
*  Joining us now to talk about her report for ProPublica is Lydia DePillis. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  Also with me is Dr. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=218.44s)]
*  Naheed Vidalia, founding director of Boston University Center for Emerging Infectious [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=219.56s)]
*  Disease Policy and Research. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  It's great to have both of you with us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=226.32s)]
*  Lydia, I'd like to start with you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=227.92s)]
*  Your story is incredibly fascinating here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=229.0s)]
*  And it gets to the question of why can't I just simply go to a pharmacy or even a local [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=232.64s)]
*  library or a public health center and easily get a cheap or free home test? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much for that, Iman. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=244.92s)]
*  I mean, it's a it's a sad reality at this point in the pandemic. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=246.56s)]
*  And as we wrote, it's a result of a combination of policy choices. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=249.6s)]
*  One was to keep a fairly high bar for approval of rapid tests. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=254.64s)]
*  And the other was to not invest billions of dollars in buying tests and making them [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=259.32s)]
*  available for free. And you just contrast that with how we approached vaccines. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=264.2s)]
*  Like there was an intense focus on improving a couple of them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=268.52s)]
*  You didn't need a ton of them, but there was a real process for doing that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  And then the U.S. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=276.08s)]
*  government bought as many doses as it could get its hands on the commitment of making [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=277.32s)]
*  one available for free to every American. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=281.8s)]
*  And that was absolutely different from how we have approached testing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=285.64s)]
*  That has been very private sector. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=289.68s)]
*  And yet the FDA is also keeping a very tight hold on the number of tests that can be [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  on the market. And this particular type of test, something that you could take at home, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=296.68s)]
*  you can get in the pharmacy, is one that has been in particularly short supply because [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=300.2s)]
*  the FDA has been very wary of the accuracy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=305.28s)]
*  So, Dr. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  Bedelia, functionally, how would having mass and free or cheap testing, how would it [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=309.2s)]
*  have changed what happened over the past almost two years? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=314.2s)]
*  And how could it make things better over the next several months as we see progress on [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=317.84s)]
*  both vaccines as well as therapeutics? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we'll write a textbook at some point in the future for public health practitioners [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  like me, and we'll talk about the importance of testing and then use all the examples of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  how the U.S. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=335.56s)]
*  failed over the last two years as wide as needed. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=336.24s)]
*  And early on we failed because by not having enough testing, we didn't have an idea of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=338.92s)]
*  how big the problem was. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=344.12s)]
*  And throughout this pandemic, the idea of having cheap, affordable tests that are [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  available everywhere, it could make people change their behaviors. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=350.36s)]
*  You know, you saw people who just got frustrated and didn't take advantage of any of the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  pharmaceutical interventions that we wanted them to. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=358.44s)]
*  But if you could link some of those activities that they were able to do, such as potentially [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=360.44s)]
*  going to restaurants to this type of testing, right, you could have identified people who [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=364.64s)]
*  were infected. It could have reduced the amount of transmission that was going on in the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=368.56s)]
*  communities. I mean, looking forward, right, to new horizons with testing, we've seen the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=372.24s)]
*  difficulty with the lack of availability for schools for testing and how that's led to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=377.44s)]
*  clusters of cases. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=381.56s)]
*  Parents could quickly test them, test their kids before they sent them to school. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  To new horizons. Now the mandate with vaccines and vaccines versus testing, for example, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  you're seeing this crunch and moving forward, you may need more tests because we are asking [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  a greater number of people to get tested and potentially either that or get tested or I'm [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=398.68s)]
*  sorry, get vaccinated or get tested. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  Last bit, all these oral drugs that we think are promising because people can take them [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=405.0s)]
*  and potentially avoid getting hospitalized early on in their disease. That's dependent [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=410.28s)]
*  on them getting tested within the first five days, for example, for both the Pfizer and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  the Mark test. So if you don't get your hands on one of these tests, you don't know your [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=419.23999999999995s)]
*  status, you might as well be in the same place you were before these antivirals were available. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  Lydia, your reporting focuses on a top health official at the FDA, Tim Stencil. You report [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  that he holds the most day to day power over whether a test gets approved. How has his [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=435.24s)]
*  department's handling of testing applications complicated things based on your reporting? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=442.2s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple of things. They worked really hard in 2020 to vet thousands of applications [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=448.12s)]
*  for tests that are mostly the PCR tests that you have to go to a laboratory or a clinic [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=456.76s)]
*  or sometimes a pharmacy to get, but under the supervision of a healthcare provider most of the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=464.04s)]
*  time. And then next generation of tests were serology tests. These were for antibodies that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=469.0s)]
*  would tell you if you've already been infected. And those they decided to let on the market in [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=477.72s)]
*  a really almost unfettered way. And when they turned out to be really terribly inaccurate, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=482.36s)]
*  they withdrew a bunch of them. And they learned that lesson almost too hard because [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=488.6s)]
*  the third generation of tests to come around, these antigen tests, they didn't really let out [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=495.72s)]
*  the door for much of 2020, especially the ones for home use that you don't need to be under [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=501.8s)]
*  supervision to take. And so they insisted that they be sensitive even for people who don't have [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=509.64000000000004s)]
*  symptoms. Now that makes sense because we do want to test people who don't have symptoms, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=518.2s)]
*  but they work best among folks who have a lot of virus in their system. And when you can take them [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=522.68s)]
*  often enough, that might be okay because it catches people who are most likely to pass the disease [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=529.48s)]
*  onto other people. So the European systems where they have master distribution of tests [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=535.24s)]
*  work when you have to take one to go to the opera or take one to go to school. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=541.88s)]
*  It's just a very different approach that prioritizes frequency even if the tests [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=547.4s)]
*  aren't perfectly accurate. So Dr. Badali, I'd like to go back to a point that you mentioned about, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=553.0s)]
*  you know, when we look back in history one day and the lessons learned in all of this, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=559.16s)]
*  one of the major moments was when we saw the government shut down their government-run [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=564.6s)]
*  testing vaccination sites, those mass sites that we saw pop up at stadiums all across the country. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=571.64s)]
*  Did that make the situation worse? Was that too premature to shut down these testing and vaccination [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=577.64s)]
*  sites ahead of the Delta variant? Yeah, and I think Delta variant didn't change the equation, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=583.72s)]
*  right? I mean, because I think that we realized that a lot more people needed to be vaccinated [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=590.52s)]
*  for us to stop the transmission because there's a lot more transmissible variant. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=594.84s)]
*  I do think that we were already reaching a point where we had reached everybody who was very ready [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=600.84s)]
*  to get vaccinated right away. And we were reaching a point where we needed to open up vaccinations [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=606.84s)]
*  in spaces where you need to have conversations with people to allay their fears, to really share [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=614.2s)]
*  the safety data. And so it made sense to move the vaccines into many, many more places at the cost [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=618.2s)]
*  of potentially closing down these large vaccination sites. However, for testing, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=624.92s)]
*  I think that, again, we've gotten to a point where to make them available, to make them useful, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  just like the oral antivirals, to make any of these tools useful, they need to be affordable, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  they need to be available, they need to be accessible to everybody in different geographical [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=642.1999999999999s)]
*  areas. And we haven't managed to do that. It's not so much one area having a ton of testing, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=646.12s)]
*  it's testing everywhere, affordable, easily accessible, anytime that you need to get tested. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=651.48s)]
*  Lydia, last month the Biden administration announced that it will be spending an additional [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=658.04s)]
*  $2 billion or a billion dollars on top of the $2 billion that were announced back in September [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=662.36s)]
*  to boost access for home testing. Based on your reporting, is that going to be enough? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=667.64s)]
*  I hope so. I mean, the other thing that they're doing is revising the process for approving tests [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=674.12s)]
*  so that it's a little bit less sporadic, so that the companies don't have to go back and forth [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=679.24s)]
*  with the FDA for months. So hopefully that will get more different types of tests on the market [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=685.64s)]
*  and solve some of the supply chain issues, honestly, that have also constricted the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=690.04s)]
*  availability of tests. And then funding is really key, right? Because that not only makes tests [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=694.84s)]
*  available, it also gives companies the confidence to believe that this is a market that will be [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=699.8s)]
*  sustainable for them. Because when vaccines rolled out, a lot of companies thought, oh gosh, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=705.32s)]
*  this is not something that we can really justify investing in. So I hope so. It would have been [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=710.7600000000001s)]
*  way better if it had happened a year ago. But who knows what other variants are around the corner. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=715.5600000000001s)]
*  This could all happen over again. Yeah, I was going to say it's absolutely inexcusable that we [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=721.0s)]
*  still cannot walk into a pharmacy anywhere else just to pick a at-home test two years into this [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=726.2800000000001s)]
*  pandemic. Lydia DePillis and Dr. Naheed Badelli, thank you so much for joining us this evening. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=731.8s)]
*  Greatly appreciated your insights. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=735.9599999999999s)]
*  you [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3-HUwv2eCM&t=761.8s)]
