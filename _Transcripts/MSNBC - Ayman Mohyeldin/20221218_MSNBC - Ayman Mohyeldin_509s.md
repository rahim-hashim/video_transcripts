# Kevin McCarthy’s Path To Speaker Is In Peril
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U)
*  This hour, we're continuing our focus on the January 6th committee's final report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC News reports that the panel has yet to make a final decision on criminal referrals [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=10.08s)]
*  for Donald Trump, but is actively considering recommending charges for insurrection, obstructing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=14.64s)]
*  unofficial proceeding and conspiracy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=20.5s)]
*  All three recommendations are possible, but three different sources involved in the January [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=24.46s)]
*  6th committee's deliberations tell NBC News that a final call has not been made yet. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=29.740000000000002s)]
*  More on that in just a moment. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=37.54s)]
*  But first, we have to talk about Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=39.5s)]
*  Yes, we have to talk about Kevin. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  You've heard never Trumpers? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=46.46s)]
*  Well, what about never Kevins? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=47.94s)]
*  A group of five members of McCarthy's own party are vowing to stick together against [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=50.5s)]
*  threatening his candidacy for House Speaker while simultaneously tearing the GOP apart. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=56.260000000000005s)]
*  Republican Congressmen Andy Biggs, Matt Gaetz, Bob Good, Matt Rosendale and Ralph Norman [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  have made a pledge, so goes one, so goes all, meaning McCarthy will have to flip all five [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=68.54s)]
*  of these never Kevins in order to become Speaker. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=74.98s)]
*  That's because Republicans have a slim House majority. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=78.86s)]
*  McCarthy can only lose four Republicans if he wants the votes for the Speaker's gavel, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=82.58s)]
*  meaning he won't get it without their support. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=87.74s)]
*  It's no surprise then that McCarthy is getting increasingly desperate. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  This week, he made the unusual move of pushing the races for committee leadership spots until [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=95.82s)]
*  after the Speaker's elections on January 3rd. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=101.2s)]
*  The thinking is that McCarthy could use that as leverage to lock down support from disgruntled [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=105.5s)]
*  members. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=110.86s)]
*  McCarthy has been on a year's long quest to become House Speaker, and now, less than [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=112.34s)]
*  three weeks before the vote that would seal the deal for him, he can't get his own party [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=117.66s)]
*  on his side. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=122.6s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board put it best, quote, Republicans are the gang that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=124.18s)]
*  couldn't shoot straight except at one another. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=129.5s)]
*  They can't even find the votes to elect the GOP Speaker, much less agree on budget strategy [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=132.38s)]
*  or much of anything else. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=138.3s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Ted Lew of California. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=140.38s)]
*  He is a member of the House Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=143.86s)]
*  Congressman, it's good to see you again. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=148.18s)]
*  Let's start with that Speaker vote. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  What's your reaction to the GOP disarray at this point? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=153.78s)]
*  Thank you, Michael, for your question. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=158.46s)]
*  Right now, we have Democrats in array and GOP in disarray. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=160.46s)]
*  One reason I think is because of Kevin McCarthy himself. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  I served with Kevin McCarthy when we were both in the California state legislature. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  I've known him for many years, and many of us actually don't know what he stands for. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  So for example, right after the insurrection, he spoke the truth about what happened and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=178.04s)]
*  that Donald Trump was responsible. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  And then a few days later, he completely reversed his course and bends the knee to Donald Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=185.0s)]
*  So I think his own members are seeing that, and they have difficulty understanding what [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=189.92s)]
*  his principles are. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  Your colleague Congresswoman Nancy May said this week that she wouldn't support removing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=197.12s)]
*  Democrats from committees, a step that Kevin McCarthy heads vile to take if he gets the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=201.16s)]
*  Speaker's gavel. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=206.72s)]
*  What do you make of that dissension, especially from a more moderate voice inside the Republican [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=208.04s)]
*  Party? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=213.44s)]
*  So Democrats are focused on putting people for politics and on safer communities, lower [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=215.6s)]
*  costs and better paying jobs. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  And what is Kevin McCarthy focused on? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=223.1s)]
*  Revenge. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=225.68s)]
*  And if you look at his Twitter account, he's pinned to the top of his Twitter account what [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=226.68s)]
*  he thinks is the most important thing for Republicans next term, and it's Hunter Biden's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=231.96s)]
*  laptop. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=235.96s)]
*  Actually, he's even more stupid than that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=236.96s)]
*  It's what Twitter said about Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=238.84s)]
*  So that's where the Republican Party is. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=242.74s)]
*  Revenge and what Twitter said about Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=245.12s)]
*  So Congressman, the GOP barely holds the majority that they need to try to get anything done. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  So how can the Democrats use this opportunity, and certainly the infighting that we see among [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=254.4s)]
*  Republicans, to their advantage in the next Congress to try to shift the way things flow? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=260.96s)]
*  Democrats had the best performance in midterm since FDR, and as a result, the Republicans [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=268.4s)]
*  in their majority only have essentially a five-seat advantage. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=274.64s)]
*  That's a very slim majority. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=280.48s)]
*  And if they cannot be unified, which we're seeing they're not unified right now because [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=283.0s)]
*  they can't even get a speaker, then it's going to be very hard for Republicans to pass anything [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  off the House floor without Democratic support, which means Democrats will have a lot more [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=292.52s)]
*  leverage in these next two years than we normally would have. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=297.56s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to the goings on down in Mar-a-Lago, because this week a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  New York Times investigation showed visitors of Mar-a-Lago were partying within feet of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=305.4s)]
*  where top-secret government materials were stored after Trump left office. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  This is, as the Washington Post reported just last week, that an outside team working with [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=316.22s)]
*  Trump's lawyers in a court-ordered search had found two additional documents marked [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=322.3s)]
*  classified in a Florida storage unit. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=327.3s)]
*  So from your perspective, how concerning is all of this? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=329.98s)]
*  Not only am I concerned, I'm angry. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=333.22s)]
*  I had a security clearance before Congress. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=337.06s)]
*  I served in active duty in the United States military. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=339.94s)]
*  Anyone who had security clearance that came even close to doing what Donald Trump did [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=342.7s)]
*  would be in prison. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  And in fact, we sent a federal employee to prison earlier this year because she brought [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=348.62s)]
*  some secret documents to her hotel room. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=354.02s)]
*  Donald Trump's actions are far worse. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=357.38s)]
*  He had documents way above the secret level at the SCI top-secret level, and they were [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  all over the place at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=365.66s)]
*  It is an embarrassment to the United States of America, of Donald Trump, when he can't [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  even get his act together and keep these documents in a classified location at a SCIF. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=374.02s)]
*  But to have it all over Mar-a-Lago is a federal crime. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=379.58s)]
*  So talking about federal crimes, the NBC News is reporting that the January 6th committee [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  is actively considering recommending three potential criminal charges against Trump, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=388.46s)]
*  including insurrection and others. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  Do you support those recommendations if they go forward with them? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=400.26s)]
*  I was a house impeachment manager for the second impeachment. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=402.62s)]
*  And by the way, I think it's hilarious that we still have to identify which impeachment [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=405.74s)]
*  because a former president was just that bad. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=409.86s)]
*  But it's very clear that in that proceeding that Donald Trump got people to come to Washington, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=412.70000000000005s)]
*  on January 6th for the purpose of stopping the certification of the election for Joe Biden by Congress. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=420.62s)]
*  And so that is a federal crime. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=428.74s)]
*  Essentially, conspiracy to defraud the United States government is an action that interferes [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=430.98s)]
*  with legitimate governmental activity. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=436.26s)]
*  And Congress certifying the Electoral College results was a legitimate governmental activity [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=438.58000000000004s)]
*  and also obstructing an official act, which in this case was that certification is also a federal crime. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=443.5s)]
*  So, Congressman, before I let you go, what would you like to see from the final January [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=450.74s)]
*  6th committee hearing and the final report? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=455.14000000000004s)]
*  How do you think all of this should be packaged? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=457.38s)]
*  So the committee members are doing a fantastic job on the January 6th committee. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=461.34000000000003s)]
*  Because I'm not on the committee, I'm not going to speak for them as to how they should [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=465.62s)]
*  vote or not vote. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=469.06s)]
*  But I do know that whatever vote they take is going to be based on the best interests [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=470.06s)]
*  of the United States of America in contrast to what Donald Trump ever does. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=474.54s)]
*  Congressman Ted Lew of California, thank you very much. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=479.82s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2DtBQRnM4U&t=482.42s)]
