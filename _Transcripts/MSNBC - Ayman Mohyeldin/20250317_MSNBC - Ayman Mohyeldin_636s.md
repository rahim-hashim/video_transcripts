Video Description: A new NBC News poll shows support for the Democrats at an all-time low with only 27% having a positive view of the party. That same poll shows 65% of Dem voters want the party to stick to their positions and fight Trump. This comes as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is facing a party-wide backlash over his leadership and giving Trump a win in voting for the GOP-led CR bill. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin spoke with Former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-IL) and Former Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) on the dire situation Democrats find themselves in and how they need to fight back against Trump.

# 'Chuck Schumer's gotta go!' Dems face reckoning amid dire polls
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM)
*  In a normal world, Democrats would be happy campers tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=0.0s)]
*  New polling from NBC News shows a majority of Americans are souring on Trump's policies, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=4.32s)]
*  including 54 percent who say they disapprove of his handling of the economy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=8.96s)]
*  Trump's allies like Vice President J.D. Vance aren't faring any better, with 47 percent [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=14.36s)]
*  of voters having a negative view of him as well. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=18.48s)]
*  Elon Musk is unpopular, with 51 percent holding negative views of America's first buddy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=21.2s)]
*  Again, in a normal world, this would be ripe for celebration among Democrats. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=26.8s)]
*  But the same poll shows support for the Democratic Party is super weak. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=33.96s)]
*  Just 27 percent of voters say they have positive views of their party. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=37.88s)]
*  That's the party's lowest positive rating in NBC News polling, dating back more than [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  30 years. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=46.2s)]
*  So tonight the question is, how did Democrats get to this moment? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  How did they get here? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  And it appears to stem from the fact that the party has failed to stand by its principles [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  and so far has failed to push back against a president it claims is a threat to our democracy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=56.08s)]
*  Look, no one really encapsulates that more these days than Senate Minority Leader Chuck [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=62.08s)]
*  Schumer. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=67.0s)]
*  The New York Democrat is facing party-wide backlash after he and nine other Senate Democrats [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=68.0s)]
*  voted Friday to support the GOP's continuing resolution, which effectively keeps the government [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=72.56s)]
*  open, but also gives more power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=78.08s)]
*  The embattled senator sat down recently for an interview with the New York Times to discuss [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=83.44s)]
*  the direction of his party. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  The interview released today did little to soothe his critics. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=88.74s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=91.84s)]
*  The Republicans would like to have some freedom from Trump, but they won't until we bring [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=92.84s)]
*  him down in popularity. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=99.28s)]
*  I am hopeful that our Republican colleagues will resume working with us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=100.68s)]
*  And I talk to them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=104.6s)]
*  One of the places I talk to them is going to the gym, you know, when you're on that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=105.6s)]
*  bike and your shorts panting away next to a Republican. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  A lot of the inhibitions come off. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=111.56s)]
*  I believe that my hard work against Trump will pay off. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, that supposed hard work isn't paying off. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=118.0s)]
*  Voters are not buying it, whether he's running on a treadmill or not. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=123.16s)]
*  Our New Poll finds 65% of Democratic voters want the party to stick to their positions [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=126.28s)]
*  and push back against Trump, even if it means not getting things done. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=130.84s)]
*  That's a stark reversal from eight years ago when 59% of Democratic voters wanted the party [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=136.76s)]
*  to compromise with Trump during his first term. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=141.0s)]
*  Democrats are looking for a fighter who's willing, able and unafraid of battling Trump's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=144.88s)]
*  dismantling of our government and erosion of our civil liberties. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=149.36s)]
*  Until that happens, they are actually helping Trump. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=153.4s)]
*  Because while 51% of voters disapprove of Trump's performance, our survey finds that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=156.84s)]
*  Trump has the highest approval rating he has ever had at 47%. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=166.24s)]
*  Kicking us off tonight, former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=167.44s)]
*  He is now host of the podcast White Flag with Joe Walsh. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=170.76s)]
*  Also with us is former Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=174.04s)]
*  It's great to have both of you with us. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=177.68s)]
*  So Joe, this polling showing that Democrats' approval hitting an all time low, what does [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=178.72s)]
*  it say about the party when they are polling worse than Elon Musk and Donald Trump? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=184.52s)]
*  You know, Eamon, it's good to be with you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=192.4s)]
*  It shows voters have no faith right now in the Democratic Party. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=193.92s)]
*  Democrats said all of last year that Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=197.64s)]
*  I said that all of last year. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=203.76s)]
*  I believe that if Democrats truly believe that, Eamon, they haven't been acting like [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=206.04s)]
*  it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=211.76s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=212.76s)]
*  Trump, for the past eight weeks, Donald Trump has proven he's a threat. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=213.76s)]
*  I mean, my God, we have a tyrant in the White House who, as you said, is attacking our civil [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=219.12s)]
*  liberties every day. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=225.44s)]
*  Trump and Musk are attacking the Constitution every day. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=227.2s)]
*  And damn it, we don't have an opposition party that's fighting against that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=230.12s)]
*  Chuck Schumer and these other nine to 10 Senate Democrats, are you serious? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=235.96s)]
*  My God, again, Trump and Musk have been taking a hatchet to the Constitution for eight weeks, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=241.2s)]
*  and you're going to get down on your knees and support a six month continuing resolution [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=248.92s)]
*  to allow Trump to do the same? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=255.04s)]
*  Man, if I were a Democratic voter, I'd be pissed off and disgusted as well. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=257.36s)]
*  Yeah, and some of them are, Senator, and I wanted to play the sound of your former Democratic [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=262.08s)]
*  Senate colleague, Chris Murphy, giving the opposite rhetoric from Schumer on working [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=266.44s)]
*  with Republicans. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=270.4s)]
*  Here's what he told my colleague, Kristen Welker, this morning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=271.4s)]
*  I think the American people want us to take risks right now in order to save our democracy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=275.36s)]
*  If we don't get that right, if we continue to work with Republicans, if we continue to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=280.28s)]
*  hand Donald Trump more power, we are going to lose our democracy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=284.98s)]
*  Is Chris Murphy more in touch with the Democratic base, with the pulse of the party and its [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  voters than the leader, Chuck Schumer? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  Chris is a great messenger for the Democratic Party. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=300.62s)]
*  We have several. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=303.22s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg is another. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=304.22s)]
*  There are several that are absolutely outstanding. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  I've seen Elizabeth Warren. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=309.98s)]
*  You know, I've seen Bernie. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=311.74s)]
*  I've seen others. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  You're terrific. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=314.41999999999996s)]
*  And I agree. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=315.46s)]
*  We need to fight and we need to be unified. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=316.5s)]
*  And I think the biggest problem with what just happened that you talked about, where [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=319.29999999999995s)]
*  you had eight or 10 Democrats refusing to shut down the government, I think the biggest [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  problem with that is how the House was blindsided by that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=330.29999999999995s)]
*  You know, I spent 24 years in the Senate. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=334.09999999999997s)]
*  You can't blindside your party. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  You can't come up with another thought. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=338.58s)]
*  But I do want to say this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=340.82s)]
*  And I want people to think about this. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=342.2s)]
*  What I'm about to say isn't popular in my base, but I think it's important. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=344.36s)]
*  I think there were truly reasons why some Democrats voted the other way. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=348.52s)]
*  Basically, what they felt was a government shutdown would give Trump the ability to shut [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=354.76s)]
*  down the courts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=361.44s)]
*  And if you look at this battle we're in to protect—and I agree with Joe. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=363.34s)]
*  The only place where we're seeing any hope is the courts. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=368.5s)]
*  And if Trump was able to effectively shut down the courts in the shutdown, where would [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=373.26s)]
*  we be? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=378.06s)]
*  So I get it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=379.06s)]
*  But frankly, if I were there, I couldn't have voted for that CR, what it did to veterans. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=380.14s)]
*  And it also gave up the power of the Congress to fight back against the tariffs. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=386.42s)]
*  But I do see the other side, and I just want to put that out there. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=392.18s)]
*  Joe, Senate Democrats have been tiptoeing around the question if they need new leadership. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=396.62s)]
*  Senator Murphy in that same interview said that he does support Chuck Schumer as minority [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  leader. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=406.41999999999996s)]
*  House Democrats, though, different story. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=407.41999999999996s)]
*  They are not doing that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=409.58s)]
*  Here's what Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett said of Schumer earlier. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=410.58s)]
*  The idea that Chuck Schumer is the only one that's got a brain in the room and the only [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=415.53999999999996s)]
*  one that can think through all of the pros and cons is absolutely ridiculous. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=420.26s)]
*  Do you think Senate Democrats should replace Chuck Schumer? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=424.3s)]
*  I think Senate Democrats have to sit down and take a look and decide whether or not [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=430.86s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is the one to lead in this moment. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=434.38s)]
*  What do you think, Joe? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=438.22s)]
*  Chuck Schumer's got to go, Aiman. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=441.22s)]
*  My God, Chuck Schumer is acting like he's dealing with the Republican Party back in [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=443.46000000000004s)]
*  the 1990s when when Bob Dole and Trump. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=449.94s)]
*  He keeps saying that he's hopeful that they're going to come work with them. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=453.54s)]
*  No. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=456.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=457.82s)]
*  Bob Dole ain't coming back. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=458.82s)]
*  John McCain, Trent Lott, that Republican Party, that doesn't exist anymore. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=460.26s)]
*  This Republican Party, and I say it, Aiman, as someone who left the party, it's an authoritarian [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=465.78s)]
*  embracing cult and the authoritarian is in the White House. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=471.94s)]
*  Chuck Schumer doesn't get that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=475.74s)]
*  This is not your mama and your grandma's Republican Party. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=478.62s)]
*  The Democrats need to understand that Donald Trump is the leader of this party. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=483.02s)]
*  They got to fight. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=488.26s)]
*  They got to fight him. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=489.26s)]
*  Senator Boxer, same question to you. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=490.26s)]
*  I mean, you work with Schumer for years in the Senate. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=491.9s)]
*  You know him well. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=493.94s)]
*  Is he the right leader for this moment? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=494.94s)]
*  Not taking anything away from what he has done in the past. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=497.62s)]
*  I'm talking about right now, given what this country faces. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=499.62s)]
*  Is he the right leader for the Democrats in the Senate? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=503.02s)]
*  If I was in the Senate Democratic caucus, I would make that decision. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=507.06s)]
*  I'm not in the arena. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=510.62s)]
*  But what I will say is there are so many terrific Democrats right now in the arena and they [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=512.14s)]
*  know what Chuck brings and what he doesn't bring. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=518.62s)]
*  So they're going to figure it out. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=522.02s)]
*  I look at the House. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=523.74s)]
*  They had fight after fight, so many of them, to get rid of Nancy Pelosi. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=524.74s)]
*  I always felt she was fabulous. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=528.34s)]
*  So this could be a big fight. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=530.42s)]
*  But let me just say this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=532.38s)]
*  I get back to where we are. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=534.38s)]
*  We have a tremendous threat on our hands with this president. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=536.74s)]
*  And Joe is right. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=540.94s)]
*  I serve with these Republicans. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=542.3s)]
*  I don't know one of them that I could go to. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=544.46s)]
*  Maybe Lisa Murkowski is the only one who would be a tad bit independent. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=546.46s)]
*  Everything I did, a thousand things, I always did with a Republican. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=551.46s)]
*  They're not there. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=555.0600000000001s)]
*  They've taken the Kool-Aid. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=556.46s)]
*  So we must unite. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=558.42s)]
*  It is so important. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=560.9s)]
*  So to me, what I want is a united Democratic Party that can work with people like Joe, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=562.02s)]
*  who's a disaffected Republican, and the disaffected independent voters to take back our country. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=567.54s)]
*  Because really, it's a matter of life and death that I could go through. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=574.02s)]
*  Who's actually threatened now between what they did to take away health care from veterans, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=578.06s)]
*  what they're doing with air traffic controllers, what they're doing cutting cancer research, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=583.34s)]
*  the things. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=588.26s)]
*  It's on and on, going after grandmas and grandpas in nursing homes by their threats [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=589.26s)]
*  on Medicaid, and we could go on. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=594.62s)]
*  This is life and death. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=596.9s)]
*  So I'm not into saying bad things about any particular person, but I want to say to my [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=598.5s)]
*  colleagues in the United States Senate, we can't have any more surprises. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=603.98s)]
*  We have to work together with the House, and we have to stand up united, because this is [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=608.16s)]
*  a threat that is deadly serious. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiEGXpKpzM&t=613.18s)]
