Video Description: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a legislative juggernaut, a fundraising titan, a woman who served at the vanguard of liberal politics for decades, announced her intention this week to step back from her role leading House Democrats. She is a once in a generation political talent, and that’s all the more clear now that Americans have gotten a glimpse of what's likely to come in her wake – a desperate Kevin McCarthy and a radical House Freedom Caucus more empowered than ever. MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin speaks to Rep. Debbie Dingell about her friend and leader’s legacy.

# Nancy Pelosi’s Legacy And Final Political Masterclass
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI)
*  New House Democratic leadership is starting to take shape. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=0.0s)]
*  Since Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and Majority Whip James Clyburn [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=5.92s)]
*  announced that they are stepping back from these specific leadership roles, candidates [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=9.76s)]
*  for each have emerged. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=14.22s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, and Pete Aguilar of California [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=15.88s)]
*  have announced their intention to run for the number one, two, and three spots respectively. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=20.64s)]
*  Congressman Clyburn announced his bid now to be the fourth ranking Democrat in the next [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=25.88s)]
*  Congress. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=31.32s)]
*  But before we dive into that news, let's reflect for a moment on what's arguably the biggest [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=32.32s)]
*  headline of the week. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a legislative juggernaut, a fundraising titan, a woman who [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=38.32s)]
*  through both her triumphs and missteps served at the vanguard of liberal politics for decades, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=42.92s)]
*  announced her intention this week to step back from her role leading House Democrats. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=49.28s)]
*  For me, the hours come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=55.68s)]
*  respect. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=61.14s)]
*  And I'm grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=62.76s)]
*  Now, it's hard to convey just how momentous a change this will be for Capitol Hill, and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=68.12s)]
*  it's almost impossible to put into words the legacy of Nancy Pelosi. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=75.36s)]
*  From the beginning of her congressional career, Nancy Pelosi has been a stalwart defender [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  of democracy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=84.64s)]
*  In 1991, she risked her life to defy the Chinese government and display a banner commemorating [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=85.64s)]
*  the Tiananmen Square protesters literally at Tiananmen Square. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=91.28s)]
*  She'd use that grit to her advantage countless times throughout her career, whether it be [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  in working with President Bush to tackle the HIV AIDS crisis and pass PEPFAR, the single [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=100.94s)]
*  largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, or rallying House [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=106.84s)]
*  Democrats when all seemed lost in the fight for Obamacare, or uniting progressives and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=112.4s)]
*  moderates within her coalition to pass the lion's share of President Biden's legislative [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  agenda. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  She was and is a once-in-a-generational political talent. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=123.14s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=126.92s)]
*  And that's all the more clear now that we have gotten a glimpse of what's likely to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  come in her wake. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=131.6s)]
*  As Kevin McCarthy embraces far-right radicals who deny the election, have bigoted beliefs [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=132.84s)]
*  and advocates for dangerous policies, all so that he can wield the speaker's gavel in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=139.0s)]
*  the next Congress. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=144.24s)]
*  That is the bargain he is making. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=145.24s)]
*  In stepping back as leader of the Democrats, but not retiring, Nancy Pelosi has offered [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=147.24s)]
*  one last master class in political strategy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=151.9s)]
*  With Pelosi staying in Congress rather than creating a temporary vacancy, Kevin McCarthy [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=155.44s)]
*  and Republicans are under more pressure to produce majority votes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  What's more, Pelosi's denying Kevin McCarthy a boogeyman that he could use to twist arms [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=164.36s)]
*  to get the 218-plus votes he needs to be speaker. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=168.7s)]
*  Because if there's one thing Nancy Pelosi knows how to do well, it is make Republicans [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=172.54s)]
*  squirm. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=177.2s)]
*  So, prospective new leaders, take note. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=178.2s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to see you again. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=185.7s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming back on the program. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=187.14s)]
*  I want to start with, if I can, a personal question for you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  I know you and Speaker Pelosi have grown quite close over the years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=193.06s)]
*  Talk to me about your relationship with her on a personal level and your thoughts on her [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=197.16s)]
*  decision to step back. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=200.52s)]
*  It's good to be with you tonight. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=202.28s)]
*  I have a very complicated relationship with Speaker Pelosi. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=207.6s)]
*  I love her. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=211.36s)]
*  I have been on the good side of Nancy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=213.28s)]
*  I've not been on the bad side of Nancy, the winning and the losing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=215.88s)]
*  I think she is without fail one of the most toughest, strongest, courageous women I know. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=220.88s)]
*  And at the same time has taken all of the skills as a woman. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=228.84s)]
*  As a young woman, when I was in business, you know, it used to be you didn't think that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=233.0s)]
*  you could do it all. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=238.84s)]
*  You couldn't be a mother and have a career. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  Nancy has shown people that women can balance juggle of multiple bears and balls in the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=244.08s)]
*  air and you bring that perspective of one world to your other world. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  She learned how to listen. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=255.24s)]
*  She knew when to be empathetic. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=257.04s)]
*  She knew when to be compassionate. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=258.78000000000003s)]
*  She knew when to be tough. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=260.54s)]
*  And she has opened the door wider for every woman around the world. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  What she has done in so many things will impact generations upon generations of people. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=269.08s)]
*  When discussing Pelosi's major accomplishments, lots of people point to what she did with [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=276.08s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=282.56s)]
*  And even more recently, President Biden's legislative agenda with all that has been [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=284.44s)]
*  passed in her in the first two years of his term in office. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=288.08s)]
*  What stands out in your mind? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=291.9s)]
*  You have a much broader context of what has been accomplished from inside Congress. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=293.24s)]
*  What stands out to you? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=297.8s)]
*  Well, clearly the Affordable Care Act is one of the most important things. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=299.68s)]
*  It's something that my family has cared about. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=303.44s)]
*  You know, Nancy and I have so many similarities in that we both had different careers before [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=305.92s)]
*  we came to, she was a homemaker. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  We both came up to party politics, to the jobs that we had. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=316.52s)]
*  My husband was certainly a child and member of the House forever. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=321.28s)]
*  Her family was a member of, who believed in public service. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=325.96s)]
*  But healthcare is just something that, my father-in-law was the first person to introduce [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=332.91999999999996s)]
*  universal healthcare, 1940, after he was one of the authors of Social Security. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=338.26s)]
*  Nancy never gave up. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  She worked with people. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=345.44s)]
*  She knew she had to bring the coalition of different perspectives and different people [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=346.44s)]
*  together. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=351.0s)]
*  And when that Affordable Care bill went through, she had the spine and the backbone to not [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=352.0s)]
*  give up, not let people give up. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  You saw what happened in the 90s when Bill Clinton tried to get something through. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi is singularly the person that deserves the most credit for getting that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  bill done. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=369.4s)]
*  If Kevin McCarthy wields the speaker's gavel in the next Congress, do you think he will [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=370.94s)]
*  have the success Speaker Pelosi had? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  I, first of all, I don't ever wish for somebody not to be successful, because if we get policies [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  passed that help every American, that is something we should all be doing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  But by the way, I think that the Republican caucus now is so focused on oversight and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=391.6s)]
*  they're so divided within themselves that they need to understand the American people [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=398.32s)]
*  are still worried about a lot of issues and they want to see us get something done. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=403.2s)]
*  I think Kevin McCarthy's first got all got to get the votes become speaker. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=407.6s)]
*  You saw what happened to Paul Ryan when he was speaker. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=411.96s)]
*  It's a tough, tough job. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=415.56s)]
*  And you got to have an agenda. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=418.2s)]
*  I don't know what the Republican agenda is, quite frankly, for the next Congress. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=419.48s)]
*  So I think he has a lot of challenges ahead. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=425.2s)]
*  I don't wish him not to succeed for the American people, but I think he's going to be very [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=428.52s)]
*  challenged and I, of course, would like to see Democrats take back the House in 2024. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=434.44s)]
*  There was an interesting development this week and perhaps it offers some insight. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=440.2s)]
*  You had Republican Congressman Don Bacon say that if conservatives don't unite around [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=443.24s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy, he is open to working with Democrats to elect a moderate alternative. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=449.0s)]
*  Do you see that as a possibility in Congress? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=455.24s)]
*  Would you support that? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=458.52s)]
*  Well, you need to see how scenarios play out. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=459.48s)]
*  I think that it would have been something that would have been very real had we not [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=465.16s)]
*  seen so many moderate Republicans, those who voted for impeachment or expressed concern [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=470.44s)]
*  about January 6 or actually voted to support how the American people voted [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=475.72s)]
*  in the last election, not election deniers aren't in the Congress. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=483.08000000000004s)]
*  So I don't know how many Don Bacon's are really left in the Congress. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=486.28s)]
*  But I think America sent Republicans and Democrats a message on Election Day and that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=491.88s)]
*  election deniers and the normalization of violence and the democracy was at stake and that the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=498.52s)]
*  American people are paying attention to that issue. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's no doubt in American politics, talk is cheap. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=507.23999999999995s)]
*  It's all about what people actually do. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=510.2s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts on the likely next House Democratic leadership teams that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=512.1999999999999s)]
*  has emerged. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=516.12s)]
*  You have representatives Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=516.68s)]
*  What do you think of this leadership team in its current construct? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=520.44s)]
*  Look, I've known all three of them for a long time. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=524.68s)]
*  They're all close friends. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=527.72s)]
*  They're all are up to this task. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=528.92s)]
*  They're strong, effective people. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=532.52s)]
*  But you know what's unique about the way that this transition is occurring is that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=534.84s)]
*  they're going to have the wisdom and the knowledge of Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=540.2s)]
*  Jim Clyburn and anybody who doesn't think that those three are not going to still be [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=545.48s)]
*  very strong leaders in this Congress who understand the dynamics, the ebbs and flows, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=550.44s)]
*  the different needs of members to be heard, to be understood, to be part of the strategizing. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=555.72s)]
*  And I don't think there isn't one of three, but I know that Nancy Pelosi and Steny, well, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=561.24s)]
*  all three of them are not when they think someone is not doing what they need to do, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=567.0s)]
*  they will have the backs of all three of those leaders as they move into these. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=571.8s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say they may not have the titles, but will they still have the power? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=575.16s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a student of this institution. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=580.36s)]
*  And the respect that a member has, the relationship, people forget the importance [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=583.8s)]
*  of a relationship. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  These are people with very strong relationships. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=590.92s)]
*  You know, I've seen some losses for the record. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=594.12s)]
*  My husband lost a very difficult chairman's race that Nancy Pelosi was on the other side of. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=596.92s)]
*  And it was very important to me that when I came to Congress, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=602.52s)]
*  I have my own relationship with Nancy Pelosi and that there be no history connected to it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  But you will not talk to anybody from President Obama on down that will not tell you that that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=611.48s)]
*  affordable character wouldn't have passed without John Depp working so closely with Nancy Pelosi. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=616.36s)]
*  And it's these are human organizations that relationships very much matter. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=621.56s)]
*  Congressman, final question. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=627.7199999999999s)]
*  You've announced your bid for vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=628.92s)]
*  Talk to us about that and why you felt the need to do it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=632.04s)]
*  Well, I it's going to be probably the most watched race in the leadership races. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm doing it because I first of all believe that mid America, the Midwest and going down that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=640.68s)]
*  southern is where elections are won and lost in that it's very important that we have [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=647.4s)]
*  representation from mid America in that leadership. It's frequently the coasts that have the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=653.16s)]
*  representation and quite frankly, they're no chairman from the Midwest or mid America either. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=659.88s)]
*  That's one of them, too. I have a long record of bringing people of disparate issues together. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  One of the reasons the announcement was made at the White House a year ago is because I brought [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=671.24s)]
*  the environmentalists, the labor unions together, six months of talks and negotiations and then [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=675.0s)]
*  brought the OEMs in. So I know how to actually get things done. And I'm not afraid to say what [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=679.8s)]
*  needs to be said, which sometimes isn't ever. They don't you don't want to step in. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=685.56s)]
*  Those I will say what needs to be said in the room. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=690.12s)]
*  We're lucky for you. We're lucky to have you say what needs to be said sometimes, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=692.68s)]
*  certainly in our in our line of work. Congressman Debbie Dingell always appreciate it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=696.2s)]
*  Best of luck to you in your pursuits. And thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=699.56s)]
*  Thank you. Be safe. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=703.4s)]
*  You too. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxLuQXf-kI&t=704.76s)]
