# Rep. Ted Lieu on Trump indictment: 'It is a solemn moment for America'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44)
*  So, Trump's unprecedented indictment has led to some unprecedented reactions from Republicans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=0.0s)]
*  who have yet to actually see the specific charges. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=8.08s)]
*  And now Alvin Bragg's office is hitting back at what they call, quote, unlawful political [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=11.0s)]
*  interference from those Republicans. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Bragg's counsel just sent a letter to Trump allied members of Congress urging them to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=17.88s)]
*  withdraw their demand for information on Bragg's case and chastising them for their refusal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=22.32s)]
*  to denounce the violent racist attacks on Bragg. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=27.8s)]
*  The DA's counsel also blasted Republicans for collaborating with the ex-president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=30.96s)]
*  NBC News has learned that Trump has been reaching out to his allies on the Hill and consulting [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=34.8s)]
*  about the next steps in their public defense of him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=40.6s)]
*  Trump has been speaking with Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Matt Gaetz in particular. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=43.88s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu of California. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=48.88s)]
*  He served as a manager for Trump's second impeachment trial. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=51.6s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to see you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=55.2s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=57.24s)]
*  Really appreciate your time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=58.24s)]
*  Let me start out with something that you tweeted or a statement that you released after this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=59.24s)]
*  indictment came out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=62.56s)]
*  You write this is a somber moment for America. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=63.56s)]
*  And noting that, you know, it's when you look at the reaction that we've seen from Republicans [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=67.44s)]
*  and reflecting on the moment that we're in, I want you just to talk about where we are [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=73.64s)]
*  as a country at this moment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=77.84s)]
*  Thank you, Amir, for your question. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=81.12s)]
*  It is a solemn time for America. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  It sets a terrible precedent to indict a former president of the United States. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=85.64s)]
*  And the only precedent worse than that is to not indict a former president if he committed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=90.76s)]
*  crimes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=95.68s)]
*  And Donald Trump, like any other American, is entitled to the presumption of innocence [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=96.8s)]
*  in a court of criminal law with an entire third branch of government dedicated to resolving [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=101.0s)]
*  whether or not someone committed crimes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=107.16s)]
*  And a judge or jury is going to assess the evidence and then decide if Donald Trump is [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=109.44s)]
*  guilty. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=113.56s)]
*  So if you let our judicial system do its job without political interference, that is the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  American way. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=119.64s)]
*  Specifically of the reaction from some of the Republicans, and I want to get your reaction [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  to them and how they've been responding to this moment. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=124.8s)]
*  In particular, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, let me play for you and our viewers [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=127.44s)]
*  what he and how he reacted to this news on Fox Watch. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=131.36s)]
*  Give the president some money to fight this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=137.44s)]
*  This is going to destroy America. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=140.84s)]
*  We're going to fight back at the ballot box. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=143.24s)]
*  We're not going to give in. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=145.72s)]
*  How does this end, Sean? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=147.16s)]
*  Trump wins in court and he wins the election. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=149.16s)]
*  That's how this ends. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=152.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=153.88s)]
*  So a very emotional Lindsey Graham there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=155.96s)]
*  Some would say somewhat tearful perhaps. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=158.12s)]
*  But what do you make of that response? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, first of all, he has not seen the charges. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  So I don't know why he thinks that Donald Trump is going to win when he doesn't even [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=164.08s)]
*  know what the charges against him are. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=166.56s)]
*  But what do you make of his reaction and some of the hysteria on the Republican side? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  We are seeing, unfortunately, a number of extreme and historical reactions from Republicans. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=172.44s)]
*  As you said, they haven't seen the charges. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=179.4s)]
*  They haven't seen the evidence presented to the grand jury. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=181.4s)]
*  They don't know what other evidence the Manhattan DA may have. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=184.72s)]
*  We should just wait to see what the charges are. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=188.68s)]
*  We're going to see what the evidence is. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  And then people can at least have more information to go on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  Right now, they're just making stuff up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  They don't even know what this case is about. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  Making stuff up in the form of Lindsey Graham, you had the more measured response from somebody [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=201.36s)]
*  like former Governor Asa Hutchinson, which seemed to strike the appropriate tone for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=206.4s)]
*  where we are as a country. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=211.86s)]
*  And then you had the response from somebody like Kevin McCarthy, which seemed to suggest [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  that he's going to use the full weight of the legislative branch of government and certainly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  the committee or the committee is under his control to go after Alvin Bragg. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=222.56s)]
*  And that sends chills, I think, for most Americans on their spine that you would weaponize [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=226.8s)]
*  the legislative branch to go after a DA doing his job. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, thank goodness we have the United States Constitution, which has a separation of powers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=235.8s)]
*  And the legislative branch cannot interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  the judicial branch, especially of a local DA. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  And again, Kevin McCarthy doesn't know what the charges are, hasn't seen the evidence. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  What he said was actually quite outrageous. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=254.96s)]
*  He's essentially saying that you cannot prosecute Donald Trump just because he's Donald Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  There's really no other reason for his remarks when he hasn't even seen the evidence or the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  charges. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=267.88s)]
*  And finally, there's been some of this kind of anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros, trying [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=269.44s)]
*  to link him to Alvin Bragg. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=275.08s)]
*  But I wanted to get your thoughts on the calls for protest. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=279.52s)]
*  We have Marjorie Taylor Greene saying she's going to come to New York to protest. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=282.52s)]
*  And I think a lot of people who remember what happened on January 6th, and certainly you [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=286.88s)]
*  probably know better than most, and we have her tweet up there on the screen, how afraid [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  are you of not mass protests, but violence, the threat of violence, the rhetoric, the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=296.44s)]
*  posts that Donald Trump has been posting on social media with the insinuation of violence? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=302.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=307.88s)]
*  So just at a very general level, if Republicans like Kevin McCarthy would just issue one statement [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=308.88s)]
*  that said the election was not stolen, that would tamp down the political violence that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=314.92s)]
*  could happen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=319.8s)]
*  And with respect to this case, certainly every American has the right to exercise their First [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=320.84s)]
*  Amendment rights. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=325.76s)]
*  But if you're going to assault someone or engage in property damage like the January [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=326.76s)]
*  6th mobsters, well, then yes, you're going to get prosecuted. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=331.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=334.64s)]
*  Congressman Ted Lieu, always a pleasure. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=335.64s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming in. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=337.56s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=339.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=340.24s)]
*  Take care. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKELh89UV44&t=341.24s)]
