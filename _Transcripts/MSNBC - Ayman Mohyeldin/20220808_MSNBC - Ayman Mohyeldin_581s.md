# Senate Democrats Pass Inflation Reduction Act
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E)
*  The Inflation Reduction Act will now head to the House, where it's scheduled for a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=0.0s)]
*  final vote this coming week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=7.0s)]
*  Joining me now, Democratic congresswoman Judy Chu of California. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=9.92s)]
*  She's the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=13.52s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=19.52s)]
*  Let's start with the big news of the day. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=20.68s)]
*  I guess it started yesterday, but into today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Your reaction to the Senate passing this bill, and I guess more importantly, do you expect [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=26.82s)]
*  any complications, hiccups, whatever, when it comes to the House next week or this week? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=31.54s)]
*  I am just so thrilled that it passed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=38.66s)]
*  You know, we've gone through ups and downs on this bill over the past year, and there [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=41.18s)]
*  were moments at which we wondered whether it would ever pass at all. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=45.82s)]
*  But to have this bill, which will do so much for consumers in America, which were lower [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=50.54s)]
*  costs for them and reduce inflation, this is a major step forward. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=56.26s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to flying back to Washington, D.C., to cast my vote to make [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=62.06s)]
*  sure that Americans can have a better future and to make sure that they will be able better [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=68.7s)]
*  to handle their economic situation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=76.14s)]
*  You'll cast a yes vote. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=79.62s)]
*  I guess the question is, are there a handful of your Democratic colleagues who may want [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=80.62s)]
*  changes to the legislation which could imperil its passage? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=85.82s)]
*  Because as we all know, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has an extremely thin margin through which [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=88.58s)]
*  to move this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=93.5s)]
*  Well, count me in as one who did want changes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  I wanted to make the child tax credit permanent and to also have paid family leave and to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  include vision and hearing in Medicare provisions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  But we all know that this is a result of compromise. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=109.02s)]
*  In fact, some some difficult forms of compromise where people really have to give up a lot [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=113.9s)]
*  of their dreams. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  Nonetheless, this is the most major investment in fighting climate change that we've ever [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=120.86s)]
*  had. And in addition to that, this will reduce costs for consumers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=126.98s)]
*  They are going to get actual rebates to make their homes more energy efficient. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=131.9s)]
*  And there will be one billion dollars in grants for affordable housing energy updates, which [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=137.34s)]
*  means that for so many Americans, the cost for their utilities will be lower. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=141.5s)]
*  And in addition to that, drug prices will be lower because there's a two thousand dollar [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=147.54s)]
*  cap on drugs for senior citizens in Medicare and also insulin [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=152.74s)]
*  will be capped at thirty five dollars a month, at least for those in Medicare. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=159.06s)]
*  So there will be significant portions of Americans that will see lower drug costs. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=163.94s)]
*  And I guess my curiosity here on the strict political terms, you talked about the benefits, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=170.38s)]
*  you outlined all of them, but we only have about three months before the midterm elections. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=176.18s)]
*  The insulin provision, for instance, will people who are on Medicare see before they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=181.38s)]
*  cast ballots that their prescription drug costs are going down? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=188.1s)]
*  Will people who are buying solar panels see tax rebates before they go and cast polls? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=192.26s)]
*  How do you communicate this lot of voters with such a short time frame to actually do [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=197.38000000000002s)]
*  so before people go to the polls? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=202.82000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think those who are going for rebates will see some immediate relief and the caps [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=206.18s)]
*  on the drugs will take place fairly immediately. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=212.58s)]
*  Some things will take a little longer time, such as negotiating for the prices of 10 drugs [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=217.5s)]
*  with Medicare. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  But I think that there will be things that people can see immediately. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=227.62s)]
*  And in fact, this is a major accomplishment in terms of fighting inflation in this country, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=233.3s)]
*  as people can see their prices come under control finally, because we know that we should [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  not have ever had the situation where Americans pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=246.74s)]
*  the world for the exact same drugs like insulin, which actually has not changed its formulary [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=252.66s)]
*  in 100 years. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=259.54s)]
*  Why are we in this situation? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=261.14s)]
*  Well, we're finally getting a handle on it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=262.34s)]
*  I want to switch gears a little bit to the other big topic that we've been dealing with, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=265.06s)]
*  which is abortion policy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=270.18s)]
*  This week, Kansas voted to keep their abortion legal under their constitution, a surprise [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=271.86s)]
*  result in that ballot measure. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=278.98s)]
*  At the same time, though, Indiana passes a very strict ban on abortions, with exceptions [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=280.66s)]
*  for rape and incest and the health of the mother, but a ban nonetheless. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=286.26000000000005s)]
*  I guess I just sort of want to step back. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  Where do you see the politics of abortion right now at this moment when you have these [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  two very different currents between Kansas and Indiana? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, there was a big difference in the vote in Indiana versus Kansas. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=303.54s)]
*  Indiana was a vote of the legislature. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=307.38s)]
*  Kansas was a vote of the people, and the people spoke. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=309.7s)]
*  Now, Kansas has a population that is majority Republican that voted for Trump, and yet the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=314.18s)]
*  vote to ensure abortion rights was overwhelming. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=322.58s)]
*  There was an 18-point spread between the yes and no vote. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=327.94s)]
*  I think it says something about the desire of Americans to keep abortion as the law of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=334.02s)]
*  the land, to keep Roe versus Wade. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=342.9s)]
*  In fact, I believe that that will translate into the November elections. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=346.26s)]
*  We will see a reinvigorated electorate. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=350.26s)]
*  They will come out in numbers. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=354.1s)]
*  In fact, actually, the numbers that came out for the primary was twice as what they'd normally [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=355.46s)]
*  seen in Kansas. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=363.3s)]
*  So people were definitely invigorated. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=364.82s)]
*  Again, it might be too late in the process for this, but would you like to see Democrats [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=368.58s)]
*  in some of these purplish, reddish states try to get ballot measures on the ballot for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=373.86s)]
*  November in order to juice turnout like what we saw in Kansas? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=380.18s)]
*  I do think that it would make the population very, very excited to see that they could [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=384.74s)]
*  actually raise their voices on this very important issue. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=392.26s)]
*  People today cannot believe that young women have fewer rights than their grandmothers, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=395.94s)]
*  that women today have less rights than they've had for 50 years. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  So they are stunned by this. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=410.34s)]
*  Of course, we are actually losing lives because if there's a woman with an ectopic pregnancy [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  and she doesn't have time to go to another state, what's going to happen to her? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=416.82s)]
*  So we know that women's futures is at stake. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=421.38s)]
*  They need the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=424.82s)]
*  That's why I think there should be a ballot election in each state. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=428.02s)]
*  Finally, last question for you, congresswoman. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=433.7s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to the stat, which when I read it was honestly startling, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=436.02s)]
*  but maybe I'm naive. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=441.46s)]
*  You're the chairwoman, as we established, of the Congressional Asian Pacific American [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=443.14s)]
*  Caucus. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=446.66s)]
*  So a poll comes out from the Asian and Pacific Islander American vote. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=447.46000000000004s)]
*  It found that 52% of AAPI voters say they've never heard from or been contacted by the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=453.22s)]
*  Democratic political party. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=461.06s)]
*  60% have never heard from the Republican party. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=463.3s)]
*  I guess I just am shocked that Democrats are not doing more to reach out to this obviously [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=467.3s)]
*  important and growing constituency that if you look at the numbers does vote heavily [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=473.7s)]
*  democratic. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=478.9s)]
*  It's like leaving low hanging fruit basically uneaten. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=480.02s)]
*  What is your explanation for why there's been so little outreach and what could be [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=484.26s)]
*  done differently? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=489.3s)]
*  Well, actually, this is a trend that had been there in the previous polls done by [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=491.62s)]
*  AAPI vote. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=499.53999999999996s)]
*  And believe it or not, these numbers are a little bit better than in the previous polls [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=500.97999999999996s)]
*  that they had done. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=506.82s)]
*  Now, what I can say that is positive is that the presidential campaigns have recognized [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=509.29999999999995s)]
*  the power and the potential of the AAPI vote. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  And in the battleground states, they did do the outreach. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=519.6999999999999s)]
*  In Georgia, they did the outreach. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=524.18s)]
*  And as a result, the AAPI vote increase was 141%. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=526.1s)]
*  Now, that came down to many thousands of votes. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=533.7s)]
*  In fact, there were 30,000 newly registered AAPI voters. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=539.3s)]
*  And in a state where the presidential election came down to just 12,000 votes, there is no [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=542.82s)]
*  doubt that the Asian American community helped to secure Joe Biden's victory. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=549.7s)]
*  That shows the power and potential of the AAPI vote. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_z_snJ0E&t=553.62s)]
