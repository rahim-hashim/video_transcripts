# Ayman: Hungry children are left to pay the price for GOP partisan games
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs)
*  In June, the government is set to kickstart a new federally funded program that provides [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=0.0s)]
*  food assistance to hungry children during the summer months. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=5.36s)]
*  The deadline for states to opt in was January 1st. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=8.8s)]
*  However, 15 states, all run by Republican governors, said no. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=12.44s)]
*  Explaining her reasoning, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said that she saw no need to add [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=18.96s)]
*  money to a program that helps food insecure children by saying, quote, when childhood [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=23.18s)]
*  obesity has become an epidemic. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=29.38s)]
*  And Nebraska Governor Jim Pillin said bluntly, quote, I don't believe in welfare. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=32.62s)]
*  Because of their decisions, among many others, more than 8 million children across this country [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=39.22s)]
*  will be shut out for our much needed aid. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=44.78s)]
*  And there's more. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  Right now, the Biden administration is sounding alarm bells warning that a key nutrition [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=49.18s)]
*  assistance program could face a major funding shortfall unless the GOP controlled house [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=52.86s)]
*  acts. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=58.1s)]
*  And the White House is pushing Congress to provide additional funds to the special supplemental [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=59.1s)]
*  nutrition program for women, infants, and children, also known as WIC. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=63.72s)]
*  Now, if Congress fails to pass a permanent bill with funding, millions of low income [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=68.7s)]
*  women and children could stop receiving these necessary benefits. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  Now, all these examples I just gave you make one thing abundantly clear here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=78.86s)]
*  Republicans don't really care about helping children. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=83.22s)]
*  They don't want to ensure kids receive the best education possible or even keep the most [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=85.86s)]
*  vulnerable kids fed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=91.94s)]
*  For the GOP, the only thing that matters is scoring cheap political points and winning [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=94.44s)]
*  their made up culture war, leaving children to pay the price for their partisan games. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS4O3IQxQVs&t=98.86s)]
