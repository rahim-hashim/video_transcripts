# Congressman Swalwell: “Our criminal justice system will survive this test"
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU)
*  Well, another week has come and gone since Donald Trump claimed that he would be arrested, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=0.0s)]
*  and we're still waiting to see whether an indictment will actually come down in New [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=6.74s)]
*  York City. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=10.6s)]
*  But in that time, Trump has gone from making predictions to launching some dangerous attacks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=11.76s)]
*  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been receiving death threats over his investigation [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=16.8s)]
*  into Donald Trump's alleged role in the 2016 hush money payment made to adult film star [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=20.68s)]
*  Stormy Daniels. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Those threats came on the heels of a series of social media posts from Trump, including [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=27.56s)]
*  one warning of, quote, death and destruction if he were to be charged in that case. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=31.68s)]
*  Now, one post featured split screen stills as well of Trump holding a baseball bat next [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=36.44s)]
*  to an image of Alvin Bragg. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=42.32s)]
*  That post has since been taken down. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  One of Trump's lawyers, Joe Tacapina, talked about these threats on Meet the Press earlier. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=50.92s)]
*  Again, I'm not his social media consultant. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=52.92s)]
*  I think that was an ill-advised post that one of his social media people put up, and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=57.44s)]
*  he quickly took down when he realized the rhetoric in the photo that was attached to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=61.56s)]
*  it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=64.76s)]
*  But that being said, I'm not here to defend those attacks. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=65.76s)]
*  You're only referring to the baseball bat. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=66.76s)]
*  He didn't take down the other rhetoric. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=67.76s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=68.76s)]
*  We went through January 6th. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=69.76s)]
*  So it's not like a possibility that Trump's rhetoric creates violence. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=71.44s)]
*  It's already happened once. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=76.0s)]
*  Are you not concerned this could happen? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=77.68s)]
*  Well, I'm not accepting that proposition that his rhetoric created violence. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=79.76s)]
*  Donald Trump might have a lot of thoughts online, but he's taking a different approach [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=85.44s)]
*  in person. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=88.48s)]
*  Bristol-ing with NBC News correspondent Vaughn Hilliard asked about the details of the multiple [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=89.48s)]
*  investigations that he's facing right now on the plane back from his rally yesterday [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=94.2s)]
*  in Waco, Texas. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=98.2s)]
*  And speaking of multiple investigations, as the Manhattan grand jury is expected to reconvene [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=99.2s)]
*  tomorrow, there are new developments in the dual probes led by special counsel Jack Smith. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=103.44s)]
*  A federal judge has ruled that former Trump White House aides, including Mark Meadows [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=108.2s)]
*  and Stephen Miller, must testify to a grand jury investigating Trump's efforts to overturn [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  the 2020 election. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=117.04s)]
*  That same judge ruled that Trump's attorney, Evan Corcoran, must testify as well to a grand [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=119.04s)]
*  jury investigating Trump's handling of classified documents. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss is Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell of California. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=128.56s)]
*  He's a member of the House Judiciary Committee. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Representative, thanks for being with us. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=135.68s)]
*  It certainly has been another week after Trump's unsubstantiated arrest claim. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=138.6s)]
*  Still no indictment that we have been hearing from here in New York City from the DA. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=144.76s)]
*  Yet, we've seen an increase in the death threats, which I just described to Alvin Bragg. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=149.4s)]
*  Tell us more about how Trump's posts shaped the week we just saw. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=154.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's posts, Richard, are exactly, looking back up, Donald Trump's posts are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=159.32s)]
*  inspiring the acts of violence that are being carried out in his name, the threats of violence. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  And this is exactly what Donald Trump wants. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  So I have zero faith that he's going to stop. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=173.72s)]
*  A leopard doesn't change its spots. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=177.2s)]
*  This guy has priors going back to candidate Trump with this type of rhetoric. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  I have a lot of faith, though, that our criminal justice system will survive this test where [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  a former president is under multiple investigations. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=190.27999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, this is nothing for anyone to celebrate, over, or destroy for. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=193.96s)]
*  Our justice system affords Donald Trump, if he's a criminal defendant, every right that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  every other person in the justice system has, which means equal protection under the Constitution [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  and due process under the rule of law. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=208.84s)]
*  With your experience in the impeachment trials, where do you think these particular cases [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=211.68s)]
*  are now going? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  Four of them that we're watching. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  Again, we thought something was going to happen this past week here in New York City. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  We have Jack Smith, who's moving straight ahead. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=222.88s)]
*  You can see, as we described in the introduction to our conversation, he is still undergoing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=224.8s)]
*  yet more testimony. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=229.72s)]
*  Who do you think will break first in terms of hearing who will be indicted? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=231.2s)]
*  Hard to say, Richard. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=235.16s)]
*  They're all serious, though. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=237.4s)]
*  And the more serious ones, of course, involve January 6 and Donald Trump inciting the mob [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=239.38s)]
*  and then aiming the mob at the Capitol, and then, of course, trying to put pressure on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=245.04s)]
*  election officials in different states, and then obstructing the effort to investigate [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=251.54s)]
*  that, and then the theft of top secret documents and obstructing the effort to get those back. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=256.3s)]
*  Those are the most serious, and my experience as a former prosecutor is it's going to take [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=261.44s)]
*  time to put those together. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=265.14s)]
*  And the prosecutor knows you almost have to be bulletproof. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=267.18s)]
*  That's not the legal standard. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=270.5s)]
*  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the legal standard. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=271.78s)]
*  But Donald Trump is going to put an absolute pressure campaign, a public pressure campaign, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=274.06s)]
*  on any of these charges. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=279.62s)]
*  And so you're going to have to make sure that you can really knock out every element of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  each crime in front of a jury. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=286.82s)]
*  But again, Richard, at the end of the day, we can't control what Donald Trump says, and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=288.85999999999996s)]
*  it's going to bring more violence. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=293.02s)]
*  But as leaders, we can all condemn the violence. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  And I invite my Republican leaders, who have been absolutely silent on this, to condemn [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=297.46s)]
*  what Donald Trump is doing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=301.86s)]
*  Jim Jordan, for crying out loud, was asked about the threats the other day, and he said [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=303.18s)]
*  he didn't have his glasses on, so he couldn't read the threats. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=307.58s)]
*  I mean, that's nonsense. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=310.5s)]
*  It's time for us to be adults. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=312.5s)]
*  Stand up for not a party, but a country, because this is serious stuff. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=314.46s)]
*  And we've seen where his rhetoric has taken us before. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's particularly relevant, given your seat and what you do there in the House. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  When we look at what the Republicans are doing, they are reaching out into the state of New [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=326.14s)]
*  York and trying to get in the middle of a case. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=330.18s)]
*  And you were just mentioning, as a prosecutor, this is something you probably have never [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=333.29999999999995s)]
*  seen. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=337.3s)]
*  You know, last night, D.A. Bragg responded to Republicans' attacks on his investigation, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=338.3s)]
*  the outreaches that they have been making. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=342.22s)]
*  In a tweet to Congressman Jim Jordan, Alvin Bragg laid out clearly that it's not appropriate [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=343.86s)]
*  for Congress to interfere with pending local investigations. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=348.74s)]
*  Very unprecedented here, as we do see Alvin Bragg, a D.A. in Manhattan, having to respond [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=353.94s)]
*  to federal lawmakers repeatedly asking him if he can provide information, data, testimony, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=360.38s)]
*  again, evidence that is not relevant to the federal government. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=369.02s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy is asking Alvin Bragg to commit a felony, because that's what Alvin Bragg [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=374.94s)]
*  would be doing if he came to Congress and talked about a grand jury hearing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=379.02s)]
*  He'd be committing a felony, because he'd be betraying the law that says you're not [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=383.34s)]
*  allowed to discuss that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=387.18s)]
*  But again, they don't care. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=388.86s)]
*  By the way, Kevin McCarthy also oversees a weaponization of government. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  We call it an obstruction of justice committee that Jim Jordan is leading. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=394.7s)]
*  And I can't think of a greater weaponization of government than the Congress to involve [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=399.06s)]
*  itself in a local prosecution. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=402.94s)]
*  And this is all because McCarthy's speakership survives every day on a corrupt bargain that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=406.02000000000004s)]
*  he has struck with Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, George Santos and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  others. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=416.18s)]
*  These reoccurring payments almost every week where to stay in power, he has to be silent [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=417.26s)]
*  or enable this type of destructive behavior rather than being an adult and speaking out [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=422.98s)]
*  against it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=428.22s)]
*  Representative, I want to move to what happened yesterday in Waco, Texas during Trump's rally. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=429.22s)]
*  They played a song titled Justice for All. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V858dD1vzWU&t=433.46000000000004s)]
