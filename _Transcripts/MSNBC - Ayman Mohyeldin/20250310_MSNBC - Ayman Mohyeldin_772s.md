Video Description: Republicans have complete control in Washington... and yet, they're running away from their voters. As angry constituents continue to confront Republicans over Trump's policies, GOP leaders are urging lawmakers to stop doing town halls altogether. But while Republicans hide from their constituents, Democrats are reaching out across the country to voters even in GOP-led areas. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin spoke with Rep. Mark Pocan on how Democrats are talking to voters impacted by Trump and Elon Musk's cuts and whether this is the beginning of a new movement.

# Rep. Mark Pocan: 'people are pissed' that Republicans are fleeing town halls
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U)
*  All right, let's get real tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans have everything they could ever want. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=2.32s)]
*  They have the White House, Congress, and yes, they even have the Supreme Court. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  So why are they running away from the American voters, the very people who gave them all [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  of that power? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=15.4s)]
*  Well, over the last month, Republicans have been bombarded with angry voters at town halls [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=16.4s)]
*  in response to Trump's policies, including the thousands of jobs that have been cut by [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=20.96s)]
*  Elon Musk's Doge. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=25.28s)]
*  Now publicly, Republicans are dismissing these angry voters as Democratic plants or paid [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=27.16s)]
*  operatives. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=31.72s)]
*  Here's Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=32.72s)]
*  The problem is they're being ambushed right now by what are some, in many cases, paid [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=33.72s)]
*  protesters. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=39.28s)]
*  You've got George Soros-funded groups. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=40.28s)]
*  They're very well organized. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=42.08s)]
*  They fill all the seats. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=43.28s)]
*  And so the actual constituents of these Republican members can't actually make it into the arenas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=44.28s)]
*  Now, President Trump has also joined that chorus, baselessly claiming on his knockoff [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  social media site that demonstrators are paid troublemakers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Of course, there has been no evidence to support this claim as of yet. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  And privately, however, Republicans are freaking out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=63.24s)]
*  Let's say Mike Johnson, who dismissed these protesters, has been encouraging Republican [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=66.36s)]
*  lawmakers to actually skip town and skip town halls that are populated with angry voters. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=70.04s)]
*  GOP Congressman Richard Hudson, who chairs the NRC, went further, telling Republicans [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=76.04s)]
*  to stop having in-person town halls altogether. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=81.16s)]
*  Hudson grimly compared this current situation to 2017, when Republicans were confronted [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=84.84s)]
*  by angry voters at town halls over their attempts to repeal and replace the widely popular Affordable [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=89.4s)]
*  Care Act. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=95.72s)]
*  That comparison should have Republicans panicked. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=97.84s)]
*  That next year, in 2018, Democrats campaigned on protecting the Affordable Care Act and, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  believe it or not, actually won the House in what became the biggest midterm election [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  turnout in more than a century. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=109.76s)]
*  Ironically, Republicans now find themselves in the same position as Democrats were back [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=112.12s)]
*  in 2009. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=116.0s)]
*  Back then, Democrats were the ones facing angry constituents at town halls due to backlash [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=118.04s)]
*  over Obamacare. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  Here's how the Obama administration responded to those town hall protests at the time, and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  ask yourself if this sounds familiar. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  Is it your contention, is it the White House's contention, that the anger that some members [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=130.84s)]
*  of Congress are experiencing at town hall meetings, especially over health care reform, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=136.28s)]
*  is manufactured? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=140.96s)]
*  I think some of it is, yes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=141.96s)]
*  They've bragged about manufacturing to some degree, that anger. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=143.84s)]
*  Now, to quote Michael Scott from the office, how the tables have turned. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=148.44s)]
*  Republicans won the election in part by appealing to working class voters that felt abandoned [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=155.12s)]
*  by the Democratic Party. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=159.28s)]
*  Those same Republicans are now running from the very working class voters they promised [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=160.72s)]
*  to protect. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=165.08s)]
*  Democrats, meanwhile, are smelling blood in the water and are taking advantage. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=166.08s)]
*  Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has been leading that charge, holding what he calls a fight [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=171.12s)]
*  oligarchy tour across the country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  Sanders has been able to do something no one else has. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=178.56s)]
*  He's been able to mobilize people in the dead middle of winter in both remote areas and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  packed arenas, railing against Trump and Musk's corruption. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=186.24s)]
*  And finally, Democrats are following Sanders' lead. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  Here's what Congressman Robert Garcia of California said just last night on this program. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=193.84s)]
*  We hold town halls to hear back from constituents. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=199.16s)]
*  So myself, a couple others in Congress have essentially decided we're going to host these [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=202.12s)]
*  town halls ourselves in Republican districts. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=205.92s)]
*  My next guest is actually one of those Democrats reaching out beyond their own districts to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=210.0s)]
*  speak to the very voters Republicans are trying to run away from. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=214.64s)]
*  Look at the turnout last night in the small town of Belmont, Wisconsin. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=219.0s)]
*  That is where Congressman Mark Pocan hosted a town hall with voters. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=223.2s)]
*  And despite the town only having just over 1,000 residents, hundreds turned out, some [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=226.44s)]
*  of them waiting outside, others watching through windows to hear Pocan's remarks. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=232.04s)]
*  He did formally invite Republican Congressman Van Orden, whose district actually borders [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=236.72s)]
*  the town of Belmont. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=241.28s)]
*  I'm sure you know what he did. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=243.28s)]
*  He declined the invitation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=244.92s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Mark Pocan of Wisconsin joins me now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=247.04s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to see you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=249.6s)]
*  Thanks for coming back on the show. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=251.24s)]
*  Let's start with this packed town hall that you had last night. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=253.24s)]
*  What did you hear from the voters? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=256.24s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about that event. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=257.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=260.88s)]
*  And I also was with Bernie and Kenosha in the first congressional district on Friday [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=261.68s)]
*  night. And then I was at the very edge of my district yesterday morning and we invited [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=266.0s)]
*  Derek Van Orden, who represents Wisconsin's third congressional district. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  He was a no show like he's pretty much been since he's been in Congress. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  But people are pissed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=278.92s)]
*  They're very concerned about cuts to Medicaid in particular. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=280.56s)]
*  They're worried about cuts that are going to happen through the Supplemental Nutrition [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=284.32s)]
*  Assistance Program. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=287.48s)]
*  They're worried about what could happen if you take away subsidies on the Affordable [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=289.04s)]
*  Care Act. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=292.16s)]
*  They're worried. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=293.08s)]
*  Many of these people are in very rural part of Wisconsin about farm grants and the lack [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=294.16s)]
*  of food going to USAID that comes from places like my district. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=299.56s)]
*  And they just want to be heard. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=303.12s)]
*  So I bet you a third of the crowd came from Derek Van Orden's district. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=304.16s)]
*  Some people broke two hours from La Crosse just to come and be heard. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=307.44s)]
*  And you shouldn't have to drive two hours to be heard by your member of Congress. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=311.56s)]
*  They should just get out from whatever rock they're hiding under and talk to their [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=314.28s)]
*  constituents. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=317.48s)]
*  So just to set the record straight, how many of those people do you think were paid [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=318.28s)]
*  protesters that were there last night? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=322.4s)]
*  Do you have any evidence that anyone there was incentivized to be there other than for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=324.24s)]
*  simply being a constituent who cares about what is happening to their country and their [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=327.92s)]
*  state? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=332.96s)]
*  Yeah, I did not see any limousines with George Soros' name on them, dropping people off. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=334.36s)]
*  We filled the streets with people. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=338.88s)]
*  And it was interesting. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=340.4s)]
*  They came from La Crosse and Potosi and Tomah and Platteville, all parts, by the way, not [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=341.24s)]
*  of my district, but of Derek Van Orden's, plus people from that area in my district, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=346.84s)]
*  the western part of my district. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=351.6s)]
*  Again, a lot of people who are very much based in the agricultural economy, this is going [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=353.32s)]
*  to hurt them a lot. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=358.88s)]
*  At the State of the Union, I brought a farmer who has lost two of his grants, even though [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=360.88s)]
*  Donald Trump has said no farmers lost grants. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=364.2s)]
*  He's living proof that Donald Trump is a liar. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  And he also is on Medicaid, his family, just to get by, because farming, especially small [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=369.32s)]
*  farms, is not all that lucrative, but you're helping feed your neighbors. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=373.32s)]
*  So people were just, you know, rightfully so, very concerned. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=376.32s)]
*  And they just want to make sure that we're doing more. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=379.96s)]
*  I think that was one of the strongest messages. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=382.55999999999995s)]
*  They want Democrats to do exactly what we're doing right now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=384.52s)]
*  And I know some other members are doing is getting into their districts and make them [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=387.8s)]
*  uncomfortable because they want to be heard and their members won't listen to them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=391.32s)]
*  As you mentioned, you spoke as well with Bernie Sanders at that fight oligarchy rally in Kenosha, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=394.6s)]
*  Wisconsin on Friday. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=400.16s)]
*  Just tell me about, I mean, do you see this as a beginning of a movement? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=401.88s)]
*  What is it about what you have been able to do, Senator Sanders have been able to do, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=405.68s)]
*  that is galvanizing people or connecting with people, reaching people? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=409.64s)]
*  How do you explain that? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  Why is that happening with you but not with other members of your caucus and Democrats? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=415.04s)]
*  So you know, there's a bumper sticker I had printed once from my campaign that said if [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=420.88s)]
*  people lead, eventually the leaders will follow. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=424.72s)]
*  The people are leading. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=427.16s)]
*  Now it's our job to start following and doing what we need to do to help have some accountability [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=428.16s)]
*  on these Republican members. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  We're getting record calls and emails in our office. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=434.36s)]
*  I hit my all-day record. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  I hit my week record. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=438.20000000000005s)]
*  And every member I talk to is having the same thing happen. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  So we simply have to rise to that occasion. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=443.32s)]
*  I think the best way to do this is you go and make those Republicans uncomfortable. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=445.64s)]
*  If what they're doing is so good, why wouldn't they want to go on the rooftop and scream [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  about it, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=454.3s)]
*  Instead, they're hiding in a hole. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=455.3s)]
*  That alone tells you everything that they don't want to talk to their constituents. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=457.04s)]
*  So I'm going to make it that they're uneasy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=460.92s)]
*  If they're going to cut Medicaid from one out of three kids in Wisconsin who gets their [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=463.64s)]
*  health care from that, 55% of seniors who are nursing homes like my mom was at the end [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=467.28s)]
*  of her life on Medicaid, 45% of adults with disabilities living independently just in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=472.32s)]
*  Wisconsin, those numbers, those are the people impacted, 1.3 million people. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=477.47999999999996s)]
*  And if you're a member of Congress, you better listen to your constituents because they can [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  either see if you're continuing to be elected or if you're fired and they can do that in [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=486.28s)]
*  the election. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  Let me ask you about your counterpart on the other side of that border there, Derek Van [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  Orden, the Republican congressman whose district neighbor is Belmont. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  You said he was invited last night to the event. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=500.44s)]
*  He declined, but I do want to play for you what he said on a podcast about these town [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=502.16s)]
*  hall protesters. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=505.92s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=506.84s)]
*  People associated with the communist movement and the national socialism movement used to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=509.44s)]
*  get their way politically is they would do stuff like this and they were called agitators. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=517.2s)]
*  He is basically calling constituents agitators, but then associating them for those who care [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=522.68s)]
*  and are speaking up and protesting and letting their voice be heard in these town halls. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=530.12s)]
*  He's basically associating them with the communist party. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=533.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell you, when someone comes up to you crying because their child has a disability [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=537.56s)]
*  and they can only get by because they have Medicaid, that is such an arrogant, ignorant [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  and word I can't say on your program comment from a member of Congress to say about their [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=550.4799999999999s)]
*  own constituents. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's just so utterly ridiculous, but too many members of Congress think they're [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=557.48s)]
*  better than their constituents. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=562.2s)]
*  Clearly, that kind of response comes from someone who thinks he's just better than the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=563.6s)]
*  people who ultimately he's supposed to represent. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=568.32s)]
*  Let's switch gears for a moment and talk about what is actually happening to the federal [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=571.8000000000001s)]
*  government. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=574.6400000000001s)]
*  Republicans can try to avoid voters all they want, but these cuts that we're seeing from [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=576.08s)]
*  Trump and Doge and Musk, they are having devastating impact on workers. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  NBC News has spoken with 20 federal employees across several agencies, many of whom are [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=583.72s)]
*  veterans saying they've been dealing with suicidal ideations, rapid weight loss, prolonged [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  lack of sleep, panic attacks and visiting the emergency room after mental breakdowns. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=594.12s)]
*  And sadly, this was pretty predictable. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=599.6s)]
*  I mean, when people lose their livelihoods and their lives, more or less, it's unnecessary. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=601.96s)]
*  But we are seeing people being destroyed in real time. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  These are the real life ramifications of what Donald Trump and Elon Musk are doing. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=613.0799999999999s)]
*  When I went to a town hall in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, that was in again, Derek Van Orde's [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=617.04s)]
*  district, and he didn't show up and he was invited. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=621.12s)]
*  But I went and at the very end of 90 minutes of listening to about 75 farmers who all had [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=623.9599999999999s)]
*  stories like Emmett Fisher, the farmer that I brought to the State of the Union, about [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=629.16s)]
*  funds that were frozen and problems over Medicare and and other grants that were frozen. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=633.0s)]
*  At the very end, they told about someone who works for one of the agencies that works with [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  farmers in that part of the state and that they were one of the casualties of Elon Musk [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=642.08s)]
*  firing. And when that person went home that night, they took their life. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=648.0s)]
*  That's the real life ramifications. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  And for Derek Van Orde for any Republican to ignore their constituents at a time, this [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=655.32s)]
*  is the real life effects of what's happening. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  You don't deserve to be in office. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=665.84s)]
*  And that's why people have to be heard aloud. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=667.5200000000001s)]
*  This is a vote that's likely going to happen in April. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=670.48s)]
*  The president said he wanted to do it the first 100 days. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  We've got like 30 to 45 days to do our best to stop these cuts. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  And it's going to take everyone contacting their members of Congress to do so. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  Let me finally get your thoughts on the budget here and what Democrats can do. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=682.76s)]
*  Obviously, that government shutdown, the looming government shutdown is kind of barreling [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=687.76s)]
*  ahead. What is the right thing to do? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=692.12s)]
*  What should Democrats be doing in a moment like this? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=694.92s)]
*  And how do you message around the decisions that you make? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=697.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so it looks like from what I'm understanding, the Republicans will pass [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=702.2800000000001s)]
*  what's called a year long CR continuing resolution that will fund government through [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=706.2800000000001s)]
*  September 30th. But by doing that, one of the secrets that I'm understanding out of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=710.76s)]
*  this process, that means you don't have directives directly from Congress, which makes [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=714.76s)]
*  it a little easier for Elon Musk and Donald Trump to keep doing what they're doing and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=719.0s)]
*  stealing funds from the middle class and those aspiring to be in the middle class and [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=722.96s)]
*  putting them towards that four and a half trillion dollars for a tax break for Donald [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=727.0s)]
*  Trump and Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=730.8s)]
*  So this is just a setup to continue to take programs away from the middle class and to [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=732.4s)]
*  fund a giant tax cut. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=738.36s)]
*  So I hope Democrats do not look at this as something you often were the responsible ones [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=739.84s)]
*  when I keep the government open. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=746.0s)]
*  We're not in charge. Republicans are. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=747.16s)]
*  But this bill is anything but but responsible. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziKeeL-B0U&t=749.08s)]
