# TIMELINE: The events leading up to Donald Trump's indictment in Georgia
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k)
*  Fannie Willis' criminal indictment against Donald Trump and 18 others is the culmination [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=0.0s)]
*  of an investigation that has been going on for more than two and a half years. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=7.36s)]
*  It is the most wide-ranging indictment to date. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=12.0s)]
*  And despite how much was carried out in the public eye or has been since reported on, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=15.76s)]
*  there is an incredible amount of information in the indictment itself that shows just how [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=21.22s)]
*  public actions fueled even more behind-the-scenes scheming. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=26.82s)]
*  And to understand and fully appreciate this moment and this indictment, we have to go [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=31.66s)]
*  back to the very start, just after Election Day 2020. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  On November 4th, one day after votes are cast, as it becomes clear that Donald Trump might [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=41.36s)]
*  lose the election, he delivers a speech hinting at a constitutional crisis. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  And the indictment says the speech was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=53.06s)]
*  Days after, on November 11th, President Biden is declared the president-elect. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=59.6s)]
*  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announces a statewide hand audit of the presidential [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=63.7s)]
*  results because of the razor-thin margin. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=68.98s)]
*  And he says there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  On November 13th, media outlets project that President Biden has won the state of Georgia. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=76.9s)]
*  And two days later, on November 15th, Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's election attorneys [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=82.66s)]
*  and closest advisers, leaves an 83-second voicemail for an unindicted co-conspirator [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=87.06s)]
*  making what the indictment says are false statements about election fraud in Fulton County. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=94.5s)]
*  On November 19th, election officials complete their statewide hand audit, confirming Biden's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  victory again, and a federal judge dismisses a Trump-backed lawsuit seeking to block the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=107.38s)]
*  certification of Georgia's election results. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=113.3s)]
*  And that same day, Giuliani and two other lawyers charged in the case, Jenna Ellis and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=115.78s)]
*  Sidney Powell, they make false statements about voter fraud in Georgia and other states [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  during a televised press conference. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=127.06s)]
*  On November 20th, Brad Raffensperger certifies Biden as the winner. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=129.7s)]
*  David Schaeffer, the former chair of the Georgia Republican Party, who was also indicted, sends [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=134.66s)]
*  an email that very same day seeking assistance for Scott Graham Hall, an Atlanta-area bail [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=138.82s)]
*  bondsman who is looking into election fraud on behalf of Donald Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=145.22s)]
*  Willis alleges this guy, Schaeffer, like the others, knew there was no such fraud. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=150.1s)]
*  On November 25th, Sidney Powell files a lawsuit in Georgia alleging a massive anti-Trump [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=156.26s)]
*  conspiracy involving rigged voting machines. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=162.34s)]
*  And then you got to fast forward to December 3rd. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=165.46s)]
*  Attorneys for Trump make the first of three appearances before state lawmakers, making [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=167.54s)]
*  what prosecutors say are false claims about election fraud in an effort to persuade them [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=172.74s)]
*  to reject the state's duly elected and qualified presidential electors that were going to Joe Biden. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=178.34s)]
*  On December 5th, Trump calls Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, urges him to order a special [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=184.74s)]
*  legislative session to overturn Biden's victory. Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=189.54s)]
*  rejects that. On December 6th, Trump calls individual legislators hoping to quote, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=195.94s)]
*  find elected Georgians willing to step across a constitutional line on his behalf. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=201.06s)]
*  And then on December 7th, Brad Raffensperger recertifies Biden's win following a recount [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=206.42s)]
*  requested by Trump's campaign. The final tally shows that Biden won by 11,779 votes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=212.5s)]
*  And that's an important number to remember because the very next day on 8th, Trump and others call [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=221.38s)]
*  RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel to seek the organization's help to coordinate the alleged fake electors [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=227.38s)]
*  scheme. It would end up involving pro-Trump electors in Georgia as well as six other states. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=233.77999999999997s)]
*  They are Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=240.33999999999997s)]
*  And then on December 11th, the Supreme Court rejects the Trump-backed lawsuit seeking to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=245.22s)]
*  invalidate millions of ballots in Georgia. On December 14th, members of the Electoral College, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=249.61999999999998s)]
*  they meet and they actually award Georgia 16 electoral votes to Joe Biden. Around the same [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  time, a group of 16 Trump supporters, well, they're meeting at the Georgia state Capitol [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=261.14s)]
*  and they're signing fake certificates, falsely proclaiming that Donald Trump, the winner of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  Georgia's electoral votes. And that's not the case. Those fake certificates are sent to the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  national archives and thankfully they are eventually rejected. December 23rd, Trump calls [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=278.26s)]
*  Frances Watson. She's the chief investigator for the Georgia secretary of state's office. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  And he tells Watson that she would find dishonesty if she scrutinizes absentee ballots in fault. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=289.7s)]
*  And then on January 2nd, obviously not pleased with his call to Watson, Trump makes that now [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=296.9s)]
*  infamous phone call to Brad Raffensperger, pressuring him to quote, find 11,780 votes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=302.82s)]
*  That is one more vote than he needs to overcome Biden's margin of victory. January 3rd and 4th [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=310.34s)]
*  are incredibly consequential days here. On the 3rd, Harrison Floyd, the director of Black Voices [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=318.02s)]
*  for Trump calls and texts Ruby Freeman, who is a Fulton County elections worker. Floyd also calls [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=323.22s)]
*  Trevian Cootie, a publicist who has worked for Kanye West. And the next day, Cootie and Floyd [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=330.18s)]
*  pressure Ruby Freeman to lie. Members of the enterprise traveled from out of state to harass [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=335.54s)]
*  Freeman. They intimidated her, solicit her to falsely confess to election crimes that she did [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=340.82000000000005s)]
*  not commit. All of this according to the indictment. Freeman later testified to the January 6th [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=346.26000000000005s)]
*  committee about the amount of harassment that she had to experience and endure. Now while all of that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=352.1s)]
*  is going on, also on January the 3rd, US attorney, Byung BJ Pak learns of Trump's call to Brad [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=358.98s)]
*  Raffensperger through media accounts. He's disturbed and later tells US Senate investigators that it was [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=367.06s)]
*  clear Trump was ignoring DOJ reports on the lack of election fraud. Trump muses about firing Pak at [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  an Oval Office meeting that very same day calling him a never Trump. And on January 4th, Pak resigns. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=380.42s)]
*  And then there is of course January 6th. Trump mentions Georgia 20 times at that infamous rally [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=388.1s)]
*  near the White House. He cites conspiracies about alleged irregularities and says election [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=394.26s)]
*  officials should find those votes needed to overturn Biden's victory. An angry mob then storms the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  Capitol and as we know, despite the attack, Joe Biden's 2020 victory is eventually certified by [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=405.38s)]
*  Congress. But six of Georgia's eight House Republicans, well, they vote to invalidate election [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=410.82s)]
*  results in other states. And the next day, Kathy Latham, the Republican Party Chair in rural [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=417.54s)]
*  Coffee County, Georgia, brings the bail bondsman Scott Graham Hall to the county elections office [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=422.74s)]
*  to breach election equipment. Latham, Hall, Sidney Powell, Misty Hampton, the county's elections [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=428.26s)]
*  director, they agree to copy software and data from the equipment according to prosecutors. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=435.14s)]
*  Over several more days, unindicted co-conspirators download that data. And then just one month later, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  on February 10th, Fannie Willis launches a criminal investigation into these efforts by Trump and his [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=447.14s)]
*  allies to overturn Georgia's presidential election results. And this timeline is far from over. As we [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=451.86s)]
*  mentioned, it has been two and a half years. It is an investigation that is still ongoing. And the very [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=459.14s)]
*  next date to look forward to, August 25th, that is the date by which Fannie Willis [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=464.42s)]
*  wants the defendants to voluntarily surrender. We'll see where it goes from there. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NmOMq_ND3k&t=469.3s)]
