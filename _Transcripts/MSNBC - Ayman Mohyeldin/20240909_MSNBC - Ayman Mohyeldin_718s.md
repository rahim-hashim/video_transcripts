# 'The ramblings of an absolute lunatic': Trump's incoherent behavior on display for the world to see
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY)
*  We are 48 hours from the first debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=0.0s)]
*  And while Harris and her team have been preparing, Trump's incoherence has only gotten worse [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=4.8s)]
*  by the day, and that is not a good sign for Tuesday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=9.44s)]
*  They're going to say Leon's going to send up a rocket. Can you imagine your apparent [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=13.84s)]
*  and your son leaves the house and you say, Jimmy, I love you so much, go have a good day in school, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=18.32s)]
*  and your son comes back with a brutal operation? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=25.6s)]
*  You take a look at bacon and some of these products and some people don't eat bacon anymore. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=29.68s)]
*  This was caused by their horrible energy wind. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=34.4s)]
*  Wind. Trump's ramblings have gotten so tiresome and so meandering that it's no surprise his [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=40.32s)]
*  own supporters are literally leaving his rallies early. It is clear at this point that Trump, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=46.64s)]
*  who has long prided himself as a showman, is losing the room. MSNBC columnist Zeeshan [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=52.8s)]
*  Aleem summed it up well, saying Trump has been embedded in the public consciousness [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=58.48s)]
*  as a rule breaker for so long that it can be easy to forget how far he is from fulfilling the basic [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=63.04s)]
*  requirement of a politician to speak clearly. Last week, we saw what was arguably the most [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=68.88s)]
*  egregious example when Trump did a Q&A session at the Economic Club of New York. Watch. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=74.56s)]
*  If you win in November, can you commit to prioritizing legislation to make child care [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=80.48s)]
*  affordable? And if so, what specific piece of legislation will you advance? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=88.56s)]
*  Well, I would do that. And we're sitting down, you know, I was somebody we had Senator Marco [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=94.64s)]
*  Rubio and my daughter Ivanka was so impactful on that issue. It's a very important issue. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=101.04s)]
*  But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I'm talking about, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  that because the child care is child care, it's couldn't, you know, there's something you have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=112.08s)]
*  to have it in this country, you have to have it. But when you talk about those numbers compared [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  to the kind of numbers that I'm talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=122.4s)]
*  not used to, but they'll get used to it very quickly. And it's not going to stop them from [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=127.92s)]
*  doing business with us, but they'll have a very substantial tax when they send product into our [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=131.36s)]
*  country. Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that we're talking about, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=136.64s)]
*  including child care, that it's going to take care. We're going to have, I look forward to having [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=140.88s)]
*  no deficits within a fairly short period of time, coupled with the reductions that I told you about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=145.6s)]
*  on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country, because I have [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  to stay with child care. I want to stay with child care, but those numbers are small relative to the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  kind of economic numbers that I'm talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=161.36s)]
*  what the plan is that I just told you about. We're going to be taking in trillions of dollars, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  and as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's relatively speaking, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=174.0s)]
*  not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we'll be taking in. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=180.24s)]
*  So we wanted to play that in its entirety so that you see it all for yourself and that no one says [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=183.36s)]
*  you edited it or manipulated it or cut it. You heard the question, you heard the answer. In case [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=190.4s)]
*  you got lost there, the original question was about what specific piece of child care legislation [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=194.24s)]
*  would Trump advance? Something a politician, a presidential candidate should be able to answer [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=200.8s)]
*  pretty easily if he had a piece of legislation that he was aware of. This wasn't a rally filled [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=207.68s)]
*  with his diehard supporters. This was a room of economic experts wanting to hear him explain [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=214.08s)]
*  his policies and legislation. Since then, top economic thinkers, including the woman who asked [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=219.52s)]
*  him that very same question, have blasted Trump's incoherent word salad. So once again, he's lost the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=225.68s)]
*  room. But if you didn't watch that with your own eyes and instead relied on legacy media outlets [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=232.8s)]
*  for the interpretation, for the story, you might have been left with a totally different perspective. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  Instead of focusing on Trump's non-answer outlets like the New York Times, Politico, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=244.8s)]
*  the Associated Press, all presented the bizarre spectacle as if it was a normal [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  policy-driven speech focused on tariffs, low taxes, and supposed explosive economic growth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=254.96s)]
*  We are now nearly 10 years into covering Donald Trump, and the media is still choosing to sanitize [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=262.16s)]
*  Trump's nonsensical ramblings to make them more palatable for the voter. The same media that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=269.44s)]
*  rightfully did not shy away from covering President Biden's age and mental acuity at every turn, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=276.88s)]
*  I mean, there cannot be a pass for the man exhibiting the same obvious decline [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=282.64s)]
*  and be given a free pass. The stakes are simply too high. Let's bring in my panel for the hour, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=287.84s)]
*  Molly Jung-Fast, MSNBC political analyst, Vanity Fair special correspondent and host of the Fast [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=293.2s)]
*  Politics podcast. Tara Sattemeyer, co-founder and CEO of the Seneca Project and former GOP [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=297.52s)]
*  communications director. Tom Nichols, staff writer for The Atlantic. It's great to have all three of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=302.4s)]
*  you with us. Molly, I'll start with you. Your reaction to that stunning failure, both from [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=307.2s)]
*  Trump to answer the specific question about legislation, and then what I would argue, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  the more egregious violation, the failure of the media to just reduce it to say Trump will pay for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=319.2s)]
*  child care by raising tariffs or making money off tariffs. Right. No, very interesting. So this is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=325.2s)]
*  this Aaron Rupar, maybe Parker Malloy idea of sane washing, right? That the mainstream media [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=330.64s)]
*  cannot report Trump as he is because they'll seem partisan. So instead, because whenever you quote [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=336.56s)]
*  Trump and you look at the actual transcript, I'm always like, wait, that can't really be it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=343.12s)]
*  Those are not sentences. And so they sort of put them together to appear nonpartisan. But [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=348.24s)]
*  unfortunately, appearing nonpartisan makes Trump seem like a completely different person. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=354.16s)]
*  And I would say what was very good about that moment was she asked a very clear question, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=359.6s)]
*  and then she really kind of snuck in a follow-up question. So she was like, you know, what's your [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=364.72s)]
*  policy and how are you going to implement it? Right. Because the way Trump really gets in trouble, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he gets into trouble, a lot of trouble, and he's constantly lying and, you know, he's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=373.68s)]
*  meandering. But where he really gets into trouble is when you ask him like, how? Yeah. Right. So, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  it was like build the wall. How? Mexico's going to pay for it. Didn't happen. Right. And so this is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=384.16s)]
*  how. Tariffs, Ivanka, childcare is childcare. Rubio. Yeah. Rubio. Yeah. Trump loves to boast [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=388.32s)]
*  about his rallies, but as we showed, even his supporters have started to tire of him. They're [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=396.0s)]
*  leaving early. You saw the flatlining of the RNC when he took the stage for, I guess, close to two [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=401.12s)]
*  hours. He recently held a rally in Pennsylvania, and by the end of it, a large number of the arenas, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  8,000 seats were empty. Is the rambling turning them off or is it just because it's the same old [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=411.68s)]
*  tired playbook? I think it's a bit of all of the above. I think that everyone has a bit of fatigue, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  even some of the Trump supporters. Now, not the culty Trump supporters, but the Trump supporters [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=426.32s)]
*  who go and they're like, OK, we've kind of seen this. It's almost like the, you know, you're a fan [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=432.4s)]
*  of a certain entertainer or a comedian, and then they give a performance where you're like, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=437.44s)]
*  hmm, that wasn't the greatest. People are just tired of it because he doesn't have any new [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=443.12s)]
*  material. That's the bottom line. He keeps repeating the same things over and over and over again, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=446.88s)]
*  and they're looking for more. And there is, and when he tries to give more, then we hear the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  absolute insanity. Trump has been off the rails more so than usual lately, not only in these [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=457.04s)]
*  rallies, but in his social media posts, the ramblings of an absolute lunatic every single day. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=464.4s)]
*  And the media does, to Molly's point, try some media. They try to report it in a way that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=472.08s)]
*  normalizes it. There's no normalization of Donald Trump putting out these threads where he's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=478.64s)]
*  threatening to jail donors, jail people who, election officials, people he's threatening, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=485.12s)]
*  mass deportations. He's threatening cease and desist to do what? I don't know. You don't get [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=492.56s)]
*  to just cease and desist people because you don't like what they're doing or you're mad at them. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=498.48s)]
*  I mean, it's insane. And yet there's very little coverage of it. It's almost, it's, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=502.64s)]
*  well, that's just Trump being Trump. No, that would be fine if he were still the reality show host on [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=508.64s)]
*  The Apprentice. But he's not. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=515.84s)]
*  Yeah, not 10 years into it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=517.04s)]
*  Right. He's running for president of the United States again. He will have control of the new [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=518.8s)]
*  nuclear codes. This is a problem. And it's why people are able to say, well, I might not like [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=522.48s)]
*  him, but I like his policies. Well, what policies are those? And you don't get to excuse the fact [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  that you did, he's a horrible person and think that that separates his ability to govern. They [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=533.44s)]
*  are interconnected. So stop giving people a pass for still supporting someone that is this dangerous [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=538.24s)]
*  to our country. That's why you saw a woman, a Republican woman was interviewed recently and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  asked why she was supporting Kamala Harris. And she said, you know, because she's a normal human [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=549.92s)]
*  being. That normalcy is refreshing to so many people. That woman that cried tears at Pentsies [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  in Pittsburgh hit hard for so many of us because that woman is just, I think she represents a lot [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=559.92s)]
*  of America just saying, are we going to be okay? And Kamala Harris showed empathy and compassion, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  things that a normal, well-adjusted human being demonstrates. Donald Trump is none of those things. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=571.52s)]
*  Incapable of it, yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=576.64s)]
*  Not anywhere near power, correct? So stop normalizing it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=577.36s)]
*  Tom, you think a childcare question would be a simple question to answer. So give me your [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=580.88s)]
*  thoughts on how revealing was this moment, or is it not revealing at all in the sense that his base, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=587.76s)]
*  people who are probably not diehard followers of politics wouldn't have watched it, even though [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=593.28s)]
*  that clip did go viral, they're probably just reading the headlines as I mentioned, whether [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=598.96s)]
*  it's in the New York Times or other news sites that just kind of, you know, sane-washed it, as [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=603.6s)]
*  Molly said. What's revealed is he doesn't care about policy. His followers don't care about [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=610.4s)]
*  policy. You know, something both Molly and Tara brought up, Tara's point about people saying, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  well, I like his policies. That's nonsense. That's top cover for them saying, I just like the fact [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=626.0s)]
*  that he makes people mad and he hates the people I hate because his policies change [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=632.24s)]
*  insofar as he has any every 30 seconds. And that notion that, well, you know, we have to talk about [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=636.88s)]
*  Trump's policies goes to Molly's point that a lot of reporters, I think, they find themselves saying, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=643.76s)]
*  well, I can't write this. I can't write that the GOP nominee is this unhinged, emotionally [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=649.12s)]
*  unstable, deeply messed up person. I'm a serious person and serious people write about policy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=656.88s)]

*  are making hay out of that. They are constantly saying, you have to go, you know, you have to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=673.2s)]
*  drill down deep on Kamala Harris's policies. And then when they turn to Donald Trump, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=678.08s)]
*  to what's your policy? And he says, well, it's something so it's important looking at it strongly [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=683.5200000000001s)]
*  more is coming. Marco Rubio, sharks, batteries, stuff. Two weeks. We'll be here in two weeks, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  right? Yeah. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkJQBRBQY&t=696.48s)]
