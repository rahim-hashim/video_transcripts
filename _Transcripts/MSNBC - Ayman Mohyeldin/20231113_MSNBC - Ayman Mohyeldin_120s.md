# Tim Scott drops out of 2024 presidential race
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY)
*  South Carolina Senator Tim Scott has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=0.0s)]
*  He is now the latest member of the Republican field to suspend his campaign after the likes [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=9.16s)]
*  of Mike Pence and others. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=16.36s)]
*  Let's bring into the conversation, Renee Graham, as well as former Senator Barbara [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=19.28s)]
*  Boxer. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=23.16s)]
*  So surprising, but not surprising as we see this field continue to whittle down, Tim Scott [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=24.16s)]
*  being the latest to drop out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=29.16s)]
*  Never really seemed to get off the ground. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=30.96s)]
*  There was all but a brief moment, Renee, where some thought he could be a viable option because [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=33.52s)]
*  he is a senator. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=39.04s)]
*  He was not the far-right extremist part of the party, but at the same time did not necessarily [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=40.7s)]
*  resonate with the majority of the base that included the MAGA extremists that support [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=46.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  You know, his campaign just never got traction because Tim Scott could never quite decide [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=56.28s)]
*  where it was he was supposed to be. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=61.24s)]
*  In some ways, he was trying to present himself as a sort of kinder and gentler candidate [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=63.32s)]
*  who was going to be very conservative, but was not going to sort of dip into the kinds [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=68.56s)]
*  of things that Donald Trump would be talking about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=74.6s)]
*  But it's like he didn't understand the party that he is part of and someone who also supported [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=76.56s)]
*  Trump quite often. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=80.64s)]
*  So he never had a lane that could work for him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=82.08s)]
*  So I mean, I thought he might last maybe to December, but I guess there was really no [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=85.56s)]
*  point. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=91.44s)]
*  He just never could get out of single digits. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=92.44s)]
*  . [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbv1HBpAVZY&t=112.08s)]
