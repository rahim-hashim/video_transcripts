Video Description: With only weeks left before the midterm elections, a top concern on voters’ and politicians’ minds is abortion. A new MSNBC documentary, “Shouting Down Midnight,” unpacks how former Texas State Senator Wendy Davis’ powerful 13-hour filibuster in 2013 had a ripple effect on the movement for abortion rights and inspired the next generation of activists. MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin spoke with Davis about the impact of her filibuster nearly a decade ago, and the effects that abortion bans throughout the country are having on people today.

# MSNBC’s “Shouting Down Midnight” Showcases Wendy Davis’ Fight For Abortion Rights
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg)
*  In the final weeks before the midterms, President Biden is doubling down on his commitment to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=0.0s)]
*  protect abortion rights. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=7.04s)]
*  This week, Biden promised that if Democrats retained control of the House and Senate, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=8.56s)]
*  the first bill he would push Congress to pass would be legislation codifying abortion rights. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=11.84s)]
*  That pledge comes amid continued Republican threats to criminalize women who obtain abortions. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=17.52s)]
*  Just this week, the Republican attorney general candidate in Wisconsin said he believed district [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=22.88s)]
*  attorneys should be able to cross county lines in order to prosecute abortion cases. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=26.68s)]
*  The fight to protect abortion access now rests in the hands of the people, and people power [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=32.28s)]
*  is what has time and time again helped protect the right to choose in this country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=37.4s)]
*  The moments in the day when the building would literally come alive, I could feel it under my feet. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=42.919999999999995s)]
*  Upset by the crowd's behavior, Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst referred to the folks who were there as [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=56.76s)]
*  an unruly mob. They've since taken that mantra and worn it with pride. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  So that was a clip from the new MSNBC documentary, Shouting Down Midnight. It airs tomorrow night [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=70.52s)]
*  right here on MSNBC. It is about the fight for abortion rights in Texas and the effect that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=75.64s)]
*  former Texas state senator Wendy Davis had on the movement after she led a 13-hour filibuster to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=79.88s)]
*  protect access back in 2013. And Wendy Davis joins us now. Wendy, it's great to see you. Thank you so [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  much for joining us this evening. What do you make of President Biden's announcement this week? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=92.44s)]
*  Because the immediate thing that jumped out to me is that Democrats do control the House and do [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=98.2s)]
*  control the Senate right now, and they can still get things done if they wanted to between now [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=103.08s)]
*  and the new term and the new Congress is sworn in. Why not do it now? Why wait till the new House and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=107.88s)]
*  Senate? You know, that's a great question, Eamon. And of course, we understand the why not do it now [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=113.64s)]
*  is because some of our Democratic senators are not on board with making that happen, and they're not [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=120.2s)]
*  on board with ending the filibuster in order to make it happen. And it is our hope that we are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=126.52s)]
*  actually in a position to pick up a couple of Senate seats that will hopefully change the game [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=133.64s)]
*  in that regard. And it's just another reminder of how important it is for us to vote with abortion [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=140.28s)]
*  at the forefront of our mind this November. I know that the economy and crime have been rising more [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=148.12s)]
*  and more in the day-to-day concerns of voters' minds, and I understand that absolutely. But we [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=156.36s)]
*  also, of course, understand that crime and our economic concerns tend to ebb and flow. Things [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=163.16000000000003s)]
*  will get better, and in a bipartisan way, people are committed to helping make sure that they will [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  be better. But this abortion law is going to be with us for as long as it takes for us to elect [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  people who are ultimately going to put national protections in place that are going to restore [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=185.96s)]
*  the rights of Roe. And I hope that people will feel that urgency and also just the long-term [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=191.88s)]
*  impact if they aren't voting with abortion as one of the most important issues top of mind for them [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=199.08s)]
*  when they go into that ballot box this November. You probably saw this as well, that with now this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  and the Biden interview, he said that he would support a federal fund for people who need to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=214.04s)]
*  take time off of work to get their abortions. Today, the cost can be up to thousands of dollars [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=218.44s)]
*  if folks need to cross state lines. Can you talk to us about this added financial toll for people [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=223.32s)]
*  who are already in very stressful situations? Sure. I was really happy to see the Biden [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=228.68s)]
*  administration talking about that, understanding that there are many barriers for people to be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=235.64s)]
*  able to access abortion care outside of states like Texas. It's not just the cost of the procedure, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=241.96s)]
*  which as you said can be in the thousands of dollars if you add the procedure and the travel [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=248.84s)]
*  costs together. It's also that many people cannot afford to take off work. They cannot afford the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=254.28s)]
*  child care for other children that they have in order to travel to access that care. And this is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=260.6s)]
*  the Biden administration's way of trying to remove as many barriers as they have in their toolkit to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=266.92s)]
*  remove, including the Pentagon saying that they will pay travel costs for members of the military [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=273.24s)]
*  who have to travel for abortion care. But the reality is with all of that help, there are people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=280.92s)]
*  who still will not be able to access that care. And one of those reasons is if you can imagine [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  having to say to an employer, I need to take off time from work because I need to access abortion [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=294.52s)]
*  care. There aren't a lot of people who are going to want to have that conversation with their [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  employers. And of course, there are many who don't have the privilege of being able to take off work. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=307.08s)]
*  They will lose their jobs if they have to take off for three or four or five days, whatever the time [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=313.96s)]
*  period is going to be for them to travel and receive the care that they need. And it creates [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=320.28s)]
*  a caste system of abortion rights where people who have the privilege, who can afford to go elsewhere, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  who have jobs that they can take time off from, who can afford for their children to be put into [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=332.76s)]
*  child care will be able to access that care and people who can't afford those luxuries will not. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=338.76s)]
*  Wendy, I want to go back for a moment to the NBC documentary on your remarkable and very moving [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=346.28s)]
*  filibuster back in 2013 where you read aloud the letters of women who shared their abortion stories [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=352.52s)]
*  with you. One of those letters was from a woman named Carol Wall. I want to just play this sound [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=358.6s)]
*  bite. Watch. I asked my doctor at one point, would she try to breathe if I delivered her while she [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=363.96s)]
*  was alive? And he nodded. No, I'm done. I can't do that. I can't watch her try to breathe when [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=372.92s)]
*  there's nothing they can do for her. We didn't find out until we were 20 weeks long, which is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=384.92s)]
*  completely normal. If we had not had the choice to have her heart stopped and induce my labor, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=394.6s)]
*  then we would have had to wait for her to pass on her own or leave the state. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=402.52s)]
*  And because of the abortion bans throughout the country that we're seeing now, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=413.24s)]
*  many people face mounting obstacles and getting life-saving abortions like the one that you [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=416.76s)]
*  talked about in that documentary. Talk to us about the urgency of this moment. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=421.96s)]
*  It is a reminder, Eamon, that this is a right that you don't really realize you're going to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=426.84s)]
*  need until you do. I had a very similar story to Carol's. And as you can imagine, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=434.52s)]
*  it made this all too real and all too important for me. And I think we're starting to hear more [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=440.84s)]
*  and more of these stories in abortion prohibited states now where people are actually able to say, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  I could actually put myself in those shoes. I can imagine that happening to me. And it is causing, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  I hope, more and more people to understand that abortion is healthcare. It is a right, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=462.12s)]
*  a private right of healthcare that each of us should be able to access. And we can't imagine [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  what tomorrow may bring in any of our individual lives that may make us face this very same [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=475.88s)]
*  decision all the more reason that whether we believe personally this is something we might do, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=482.44s)]
*  we need to protect the ability for those who choose this healthcare for themselves to receive [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=489.56s)]
*  it when they need it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=496.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TiJAbzPbg&t=512.44s)]
