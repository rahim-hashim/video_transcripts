Video Description: The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, Democrats’ main political group focused on redistricting, is expanding its scope for the midterms and working to defend election administration offices from these Trump-backed extremists. However, that move seems to stand in stark contrast with the efforts of some Democrats to boost the profiles of anti-democratic, MAGA-cult candidates in several key races. Kelly Burton, the President of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, joined MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin to explain what’s behind this disconnect.

# Democrats’ Midterm Strategy Is Akin To ‘Playing With Fire’
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY)
*  There are just 100 days until the midterms, and there's a clear and present threat to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=0.0s)]
*  American democracy, thanks to a slew of far-right conspiracy-mongers and avowed Christian nationalists [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=8.72s)]
*  that are running for office in this country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=14.48s)]
*  The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, the Democrats' main political group that's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=16.96s)]
*  focused on redistricting, is expanding its scope for the midterms and working to defend [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=22.42s)]
*  election administration offices from these Trump-backed extremists. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=28.6s)]
*  And that's excellent news. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  We should applaud that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=33.88s)]
*  But it seems to be in stark contrast with the efforts of some Democrats to actually [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=35.32s)]
*  boost the profiles of anti-democratic, MAGA-cult candidates. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=39.92s)]
*  Some Democrats are effectively bankrolling the same radicals that they're warning about, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=45.16s)]
*  hoping that they'll be easier to beat in general election races than the more moderate mainstream [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=49.56s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=54.6s)]
*  Now, as history shows, efforts like this are prone to backfiring and are dangerous. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=55.6s)]
*  Consider the case of George Christopher. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  In advance of the 1966 California governor's race, George Christopher served as the popular [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=62.52s)]
*  moderate Republican mayor of San Francisco. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Democrats recognized that he would be a formidable threat in the general election, so they leaked [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=71.56s)]
*  a trove of opposition research to the press and backed his more far-right GOP primary [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=76.2s)]
*  opponent. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=82.32s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=83.32s)]
*  That far-right rival won the primary. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=84.58s)]
*  But then he won the general election as well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=87.46s)]
*  And he'd eventually used his time as governor to run for president. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=90.6s)]
*  That candidate's name? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=94.78s)]
*  Ronald Reagan. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=96.78s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss her group's efforts and more is Kelly Burton, the president of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=102.34s)]
*  Kelly, it's great to have you with us. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=104.5s)]
*  Your organization is working to combat anti-democratic candidates across the country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=106.38s)]
*  NDRC is doing in this current climate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=111.94s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me here to talk about this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=114.98s)]
*  I think as you have noted throughout this show with 100 days left, there is one thing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=119.66s)]
*  that is very clear and it is that democracy is on the ballot. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=124.02s)]
*  And we have been fighting for years to realize fair maps through the redistricting process. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=128.3s)]
*  But we know that if we don't have free and fair elections, we can't fully realize the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=134.26s)]
*  impact of those fair maps. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=139.62s)]
*  That's why as soon as the map drawing process was done, we launched an expanded electoral [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=141.74s)]
*  program that hones in on some of the most important elections that we all need to care [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  about, not just for protecting and ensuring fair maps, but also for protecting our democracy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=152.9s)]
*  It's 17 states. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  It's everything from governors to secretaries of state, Supreme Court races, as well as [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=160.68s)]
*  state legislatures. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=166.58s)]
*  And all of those will be incredibly important in this fight to save and protect our democracy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=167.82s)]
*  So Kelly, what's your reaction to the Democrats in some cases boosting the profiles of some [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=174.1s)]
*  of these anti-democratic figures? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=180.38s)]
*  Do you think that the Democrats are playing with fire by trying to push through or at [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=183.28s)]
*  least focus on targeting these far right extreme candidates with the hopes that they can paint [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=187.94s)]
*  the Republican Party with this broad brush and then ultimately face off against them [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=195.26000000000002s)]
*  in a general election? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, I've spent a lot of time inside those committees where those decisions are made. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=200.74s)]
*  And one thing I've learned is that you really can't judge their actions from the outside. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=206.58s)]
*  We're not all seeing the information that they're saying. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  We're not working with the details of the races that they are. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=213.06s)]
*  So I can't speak to that strategy specifically. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=216.5s)]
*  But I will say that, you know, it is elections are about choices. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=219.42s)]
*  And it is very clear in this election that there are two very stark differences between [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=224.46s)]
*  the two parties on the ballot. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=229.78s)]
*  And we have a saying at the NDRC and also in my own home that you got to keep the main [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=231.86s)]
*  thing the main thing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=235.86s)]
*  And the main thing in this election is that you have one party, the Republican Party, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=237.3s)]
*  that absolutely is supporting candidates who are election deniers, you know, supporting [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=242.94s)]
*  candidates who were at the January 6th insurrection, who continue to believe that Biden is not [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=247.7s)]
*  the legitimate president of this country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=252.54s)]
*  And those candidates are running as Republicans and they are being elected by Republican Party [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=254.98s)]
*  voters. And that is the heart of the matter here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  That is what's happening in our nation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  And that's the real part of what is threatening our democracy is that you have one party that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=264.62s)]
*  really, as my boss, Eric Holder, recently said in his new book, just ain't that into [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=270.26s)]
*  democracy right now. And hopefully that doesn't last forever. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=274.42s)]
*  And they're having a real reckoning within their party. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=277.82s)]
*  But that is the heart of the matter, that this is a Republican Party that is not supporting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=280.14000000000004s)]
*  democracy. And you have Republican candidates that are questioning the structures of our [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=284.3s)]
*  democracy and Republican voters that are voting for them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  And that's what we need to stay focused on. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=290.62s)]
*  And that's why we're supporting democracy defenders up and down the ballot. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=292.14s)]
*  Let's talk about Congressman Peter Major for a moment. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  He was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump for his actions around [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=300.38s)]
*  January the 6th. And now some Democrats are backing his Trump endorsed far right opponent. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=304.5s)]
*  Talk us through your thoughts on this one. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think what you're seeing here, again, I can't speak to the specific strategy and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=313.86s)]
*  to the data and the details that the D triple C and others are looking at with this race. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=319.3s)]
*  But this is one of the districts that got more fair in redistricting. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=323.9s)]
*  Michigan was the congressional map in Michigan was drawn by a commission. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=327.5s)]
*  It's far better and fairer than it was last decade when it was gerrymandered by Republican [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=331.66s)]
*  legislature. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=336.78s)]
*  So overall, this map is more fair. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=338.1s)]
*  And this is a district that went from a Biden 48 district to a Biden 54 district, which [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=340.54s)]
*  means Democrats should win this district. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=347.26s)]
*  I have to imagine this is a must win district for the D triple C. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=349.98s)]
*  And no matter who wins the Republican primary on Tuesday, I'm sure they're going to be all [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  in to elect the Democratic candidate in this district, no matter who wins on the Republican [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=357.98s)]
*  side. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=362.78s)]
*  Let me switch gears if I can and talk to you about a new report from Bloomberg, which found [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=364.42s)]
*  that because of redistricting, the 22 majority black congressional districts that currently [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=368.74s)]
*  exist could be whittled down to as few as nine after the midterms. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=374.86s)]
*  Your reaction to that? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=379.98s)]
*  I mean, look, it's a real concern overall. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=382.98s)]
*  And the thing to know and to really dig in on when you're looking at these numbers is [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=387.06s)]
*  that this is that is largely driven by an intentional strategy by the Republicans to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=392.98s)]
*  go after black elected officials to go after black majority and black influence districts [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=400.1s)]
*  in the map. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=406.54s)]
*  The reason for the decline is largely because of the way that the Republicans drew their [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  maps in states like Florida and Georgia and Ohio and Texas, where, you know, 95 percent [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=412.70000000000005s)]
*  of the growth in Texas came from people of color. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=420.26000000000005s)]
*  But the Republicans drew more white majority districts than they had last decade. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=422.54s)]
*  Similarly, in Texas, where Governor DeSantis is congressional map directly went after the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=427.1s)]
*  districts of Congressmen Lassen and the district held currently by Congresswoman Demings [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=433.5s)]
*  intentionally in order to go after those members and the representation of the black voters [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  in those districts. So this was an intentional strategy by the Republicans. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=442.94s)]
*  And that is why we are continuing to fight back against what we think are illegal maps. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=446.62s)]
*  We are in court still fighting against those maps in states like Florida, Georgia, Texas, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=452.62s)]
*  Ohio. And, you know, the states, for example, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=458.65999999999997s)]
*  Alabama and Louisiana, where the legislature just refused to draw an additional black [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=462.82s)]
*  majority district that should be drawn based on the population of those states. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=468.62s)]
*  So we're fighting in court on all those on all those maps. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=472.18s)]
*  And, you know, we don't accept this as the final number for the decade. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=475.02s)]
*  We'll keep fighting. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFSrPpGnCTY&t=479.34s)]
