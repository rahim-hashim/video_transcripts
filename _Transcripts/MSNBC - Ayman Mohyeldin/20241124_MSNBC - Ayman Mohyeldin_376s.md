# House passes bill that would give Trump administration broad power to kill nonprofits
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84)
*  Authoritarianism is not born overnight. It creeps in. It erodes our freedoms. A tyrant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=0.0s)]
*  tightens his grip, not just by seizing power, but when he demands new powers and those who [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=8.76s)]
*  can stop him willingly cede and bend to his will. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=17.32s)]
*  That was Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett speaking out against a bill passed by the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=22.84s)]
*  House that would give the Trump administration broad powers to kill nonprofit organizations. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=26.86s)]
*  The legislation called the Stop Terror Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=32.22s)]
*  allows the Treasury Department to target and investigate organizations that they deem terrorists [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=37.66s)]
*  supporting without needing to provide the evidence behind that designation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=43.14s)]
*  Now, it is already a federal criminal offense for nonprofits or anyone else in this country [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=48.46s)]
*  to support terrorist groups. So a bill like this could be at best unnecessary and at worst [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=54.22s)]
*  devastating for rights groups. This week, a group of over 300 organizations sent congressional [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=61.66s)]
*  leaders a letter that read, quote, the executive branch could use this authority to target [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=67.74s)]
*  its political opponents and stifle dissent. Joining me now is someone working to stop [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=73.3s)]
*  this bill from moving forward, Kia Hamadanshi, senior political or senior policy counsel [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=78.5s)]
*  at the ACLU's National Political Advocacy Division. Kia, it's great to have you on the show. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=83.34s)]
*  There was a previous bill with this nonprofit provision that was initially introduced last [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=88.86s)]
*  November. It was touted by its Republican supporters as a way to crack down on pro-Palestinian [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=92.86s)]
*  supporters that they claimed were exploiting tax laws. But as the ACLU and other organizations [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=98.5s)]
*  note in the letter to Congress this week, the potential for abuse under this law is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=105.30000000000001s)]
*  broad. How are you working to prevent this bill from advancing and explain to us why you think [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  it can be dangerously used? Yeah, so as an initial matter, I mean, it provides the Treasury [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=114.26s)]
*  Secretary with a lot of unilateral discretion to strip nonprofits of their tax income status [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=120.26s)]
*  without any kind of necessarily having to show the evidence. And within an appeals process, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=131.54000000000002s)]
*  straight to the Treasury Secretary. And you can strip them as a nonprofit before you ever go [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=137.33999999999997s)]
*  before a neutral decision maker. And we worked really hard as much as we could to try to make [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=143.66s)]
*  sure that we whipped up as much opposition in the House. And a number of House members [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=149.42s)]
*  shifted their vote even from last week. And it's critical to keep that opposition to block things [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=153.66s)]
*  in the Senate. Nonprofits are usually cash strapped. Their tax exemption status is critical [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  for their work. And according to this, you know, they would be if they are accused of wrongdoing, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=166.42s)]
*  they would have 90 days, I believe, to prove that they aren't supporting terrorist organizations. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=170.42s)]
*  If they cannot, their tax exemption status would be stripped. Would organizations, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=175.62s)]
*  these nonprofit organizations even have the means to fend off these legal battles? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=181.14s)]
*  I mean, that's definitely a concern, right? There's the stigma of being designated a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=187.7s)]
*  terrorist supporting organization. So it's not just the crippling legal fees, but, you know, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=192.34s)]
*  it's the reputational loss and the financial that comes with all of that. And, you know, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=198.5s)]
*  the 90 days is not a real, they call it a cure process. It's not a real cure process. You don't [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=203.94s)]
*  necessarily have all the evidence they used against you. They won't give you exculpatory [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=208.82s)]
*  evidence necessarily. And it's entirely at the judgment of the Secretary of Treasury. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=213.22s)]
*  And there's an appeals process after the fact. But at that point, the damage is already done. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  We've seen this playbook around the world, and we've seen the devastating impact that laws like [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=224.34s)]
*  this have created. Nicaragua, for example, had a similar bill, didn't only impact free speech, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=228.74s)]
*  it also limited the ability of aid workers to operate in that country. Over the past year, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=234.1s)]
*  we've also seen Israel's terrorist accusations against UNRWA, leading several nations to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=240.74s)]
*  temporarily pause their funding and impacting lives on the ground in the Gaza Strip. These [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=245.22s)]
*  kind of accusations, they really impact people who are already extremely vulnerable. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=250.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's absolutely, that's absolutely true. And it's also true that this is a common way [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=258.42s)]
*  that the terrorism, the accusation of terrorism, we've seen around the world, can often be used [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=263.78s)]
*  for political reasons in terms of silencing dissent, silencing critics, trying to silence [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=268.9s)]
*  civil society. And I think the concern is that this bill became law. You can see the same thing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=274.18s)]
*  When you look at other groups, climate justice groups, environmental groups, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=280.26s)]
*  they could be targeted if their policy or if their objectives of what they're working [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=283.3s)]
*  for do not align with the policy of the incoming administration. You have 19 states significantly [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=287.22s)]
*  enhancing penalties for protesters challenging pipelines and other quote, critical infrastructure. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  If this bill were to pass, would there be any protection left for dissent and activists, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=298.34s)]
*  not just simply the organizations? Yeah, I mean, look, I think that, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=305.53999999999996s)]
*  of course, we would, if this bill became law, we would do everything to fight it and make sure [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  that the constitution and everything is upheld. But I think one of the things you saw is there [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=315.7s)]
*  was a really broad based coalition against this bill, whether it was environmental groups or [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=321.94s)]
*  whether it was labor, whether it was reproductive right groups, because all these groups could be [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=326.26s)]
*  under threat in a Trump administration. And that's why you saw just a broad opposition [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=331.78s)]
*  to trying everything we can to prevent this bill from becoming law. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=339.06s)]
*  All right. Best of luck to you. I mean, obviously it doesn't have a chance in this administration, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=342.09999999999997s)]
*  but certainly if Trump, I mean, once he does get into office, it could be a high priority issue [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=346.5s)]
*  for him and other Republicans. So we certainly appreciate your vigilance on it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerjdPpQF84&t=352.09999999999997s)]
