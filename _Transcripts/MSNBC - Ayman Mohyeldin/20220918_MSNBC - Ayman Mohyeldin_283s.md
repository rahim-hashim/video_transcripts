Video Description: 60 years ago, Southern segregationists, enraged by the progress of the Civil Rights Movement, deceived some 200 Black Americans into boarding buses that would move them from below the Mason-Dixon line to Massachusetts. This week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis channeled their racism in pulling off a similar stunt – only this time with asylum seekers from Venezuela.

# DeSantis Builds Upon the Long History of Bigots Busing Unwanted Minorities North
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g)
*  All right, so we are just eight weeks from the midterms, and Republicans are desperate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=0.0s)]
*  to change the conversation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=7.08s)]
*  Gas prices, what the GOP has rallied around for months, well, they have fallen for more [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=9.08s)]
*  than 90 straight days. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=13.16s)]
*  Ukraine, which was once seen at best as a quagmire and at worst a lost cause, is seeing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=15.36s)]
*  some major military gains in the battlefield. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Abortion has driven young people and women to register to vote, and polls are indicating [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=24.86s)]
*  far better outlooks for Democrats than once anticipated, including for President Biden, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=28.3s)]
*  who has seen his approval rating jump nine points in the last few weeks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=34.14s)]
*  So when the planned talking points for the Republican Party begins to fall apart, they [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=38.74s)]
*  use the one tool that they've used for decades to rile up their base, dehumanizing poor, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=44.02s)]
*  innocent brown people. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  Look at the gross inhumanity we saw this week from Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, 50 [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=51.58s)]
*  Venezuelan migrants, 50 men, women and children with nothing to their names beyond what they [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=56.74s)]
*  could carry on their backs, found themselves the victims of a ruse so cartoonishly vile, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=62.14s)]
*  it boggles the mind. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=68.3s)]
*  DeSantis shipped these men and women, according to reports, under false pretenses, promising [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=70.3s)]
*  free housing, fast-track visa applications in Boston to lure as many asylum seekers as [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=75.66s)]
*  possible onto a pair of planes destined not for Boston, but Martha's Vineyard. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=82.02s)]
*  He didn't inform the governor of Massachusetts, a Republican, by the way, nor the White House. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=88.58s)]
*  He only told the Fox propaganda network. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=94.32s)]
*  Now, DeSantis' intent, I suppose, was to show the New Englanders are somehow just as racist [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  and as xenophobic as he and his cronies are. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=102.74s)]
*  He failed miserably. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  In fact, the residents of the island welcomed the migrants with open arms, providing them [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  with food, shelter, COVID-19 tests, and the means to reach their loved ones in Boston. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=111.26s)]
*  The godless lives, as DeSantis and his ilk are so fond of grousing about, proved themselves [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=117.42s)]
*  to be far more Christian than their faux fundamentalist friends thought possible. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=123.44s)]
*  Because, and let's be clear here, there's nothing Christian about dehumanizing migrants [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=128.58s)]
*  for political purposes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=133.3s)]
*  Up until now, DeSantis has gotten away with this for two reasons. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=135.3s)]
*  One, because many in the news media are distracted by shiny objects, stopping their reports about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=138.78s)]
*  lower gas prices and Biden's good poll numbers to talk about how politically savvy DeSantis [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=144.42s)]
*  is being. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=149.54s)]
*  And as an aside, it's disgusting to see members of the news media talk in such crass political [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=150.94s)]
*  terms about human lives. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=156.14s)]
*  And the other reason DeSantis is getting away with this is because the men and women and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=158.82s)]
*  children that he preyed upon were people of color, people who speak a different language, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=162.5s)]
*  and who in so many ways are not seen as quote, real by far too many Americans. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=167.98s)]
*  They're seen as the other, something less human. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=174.14s)]
*  But these migrants are human, and they don't deserve to be treated like political pawns. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=177.82s)]
*  DeSantis is so cravenly political, he never dared attempt to transport undocumented Cuban [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=182.78s)]
*  migrants from Florida. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=188.1s)]
*  No, he knows all too well that Cuban Americans yield significant political clout in his state. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=189.73999999999998s)]
*  So he takes even more marginalized communities and abuses them, treats them like cattle, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=196.02s)]
*  because they don't have the agency or means to defend themselves. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  Ron DeSantis is a modern day version of the southern segregationists who 60 years ago, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=205.62s)]
*  enraged by the progress black Americans were making during the civil rights movement, deceived [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=210.82000000000002s)]
*  some 200 black Americans into boarding buses that would move them from below the Mason [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=215.5s)]
*  Dixon line to Massachusetts. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=220.46s)]
*  Those racists also wanted to expose liberal hypocrisy, and they too failed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=223.74s)]
*  Because unfortunately for the bigoted Ron DeSantis and the bigots who champion him and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=229.86s)]
*  the bigots who came before him, there are an awful lot of Americans who welcome outsiders. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=234.38s)]
*  And they don't flinch when they read the word scrawled on the Statue of Liberty, give us [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=240.36s)]
*  your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  One of those Americans, Massachusetts State Representative Dylan Fernandez, will join [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=250.86s)]
*  us after the break to talk about this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8e1wIjR98g&t=255.16000000000003s)]
