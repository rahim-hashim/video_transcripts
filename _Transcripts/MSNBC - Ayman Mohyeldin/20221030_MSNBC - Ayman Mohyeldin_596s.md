# Katie Hobbs Talks Voter Intimidation In Arizona As Early Voting Is Underway
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU)
*  Call it Trump's election denier trifecta on the Arizona ballot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=0.0s)]
*  The Republican contenders for Secretary of State, Attorney General, and governor in Arizona [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  have all loudly echoed Trump's election lies, and they continue to spread disinformation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=11.16s)]
*  about voting just 10 days before the midterms. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=17.04s)]
*  That disinformation in part has led to a series of voter intimidation issues across the state. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=21.6s)]
*  Arizona State Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs, who will join me in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=27.16s)]
*  just a moment, has referred a total of 10 potential voter intimidation complaints to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=30.84s)]
*  law enforcement. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=36.0s)]
*  In some of these instances, voters are being photographed, filmed, and followed as they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=37.0s)]
*  drop off their early ballots at drop boxes, behavior that's actually being encouraged [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=41.68s)]
*  by some Republicans in the state. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=47.44s)]
*  Arizona State Senator Kelly Townsend told residents back in May, I have been so pleased [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=49.96s)]
*  to hear all of you vigilantes out there that want to camp out at these drop boxes, right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  So do it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=60.0s)]
*  Do it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=61.5s)]
*  More recently, the Republican nominee for Secretary of State Mark Fincham has defended [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  this vigilantism. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=66.8s)]
*  Here's President Obama tonight seeming to reference these incidents. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=68.96s)]
*  They're telling supporters, you got to stand outside polling places armed with guns and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=75.08s)]
*  dressed in tactical gear. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, that's the kind of thing that that ends up getting people hurt. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=82.84s)]
*  At least one Republican, not from Arizona, is fighting back. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  This Chinese political action committee is urging voters to reject Republicans Carrie [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=90.64s)]
*  Lake and Mark Fincham due to their election denialism. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=94.64s)]
*  You have a candidate for governor, Carrie Lake. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  You have a candidate for Secretary of State Mark Fincham, both of whom have said that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=102.0s)]
*  they will only honor the results of an election if they agree with it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=106.48s)]
*  And if you care about the survival of our republic, we cannot give people power who [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=110.44s)]
*  will not honor elections. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=116.12s)]
*  And joining me now is Katie Hobbs, the current Arizona Secretary of State and the Democratic [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=118.92s)]
*  candidate for governor. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=123.4s)]
*  Secretary Hobbs, thank you so much for making time for us. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=125.96s)]
*  I'd like to start with just what we saw this last week. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=128.32s)]
*  You had a federal judge in Phoenix reject an attempt to stop these drop box watchers. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=132.0s)]
*  Aside from referring these cases to law enforcement, how else is your office assuring voters that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=137.32s)]
*  they can safely cast their vote? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=143.2s)]
*  Well, I think that publicity, the level of publicity that these complaints have have [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=146.56s)]
*  reached has helped to inform voters of their rights, make sure that they know that they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=151.64s)]
*  are able to cast their ballots free from harassment and intimidation and that there's a recourse [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=157.16s)]
*  to report these incidents if they experience them and that there are other avenues that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  they can return their ballot if they feel intimidated at a certain location. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=168.88s)]
*  But it is imperative that these investigative bodies act quickly to to address this because [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=173.12s)]
*  there's just 10 days left in the election and the courts made it clear they're not going [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=179.88s)]
*  to stop it now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  And so we need quick action from the investigative authorities. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  What's at stake here in your state's races? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=188.92s)]
*  I mean, if any one of these Republican election deniers wins in your state, what does that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=191.48s)]
*  mean? And is that being crystallized enough for the voters of your state? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=197.6s)]
*  You know, Arizona has been ground zero for so much level of activity based on Trump's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=203.8s)]
*  big lie. We have the Maricopa County fraud that played out for for a good six months [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=209.24s)]
*  here. We've been ground zero for so much and Arizonans are well aware of what's at stake [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=214.88s)]
*  here. And they also are tired of it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=220.16s)]
*  They're ready to move on and focus on issues that really that that are urgent, that we [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=223.4s)]
*  need leaders to address them instead of continuing to dwell on this election of the past. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=229.16s)]
*  But what's clear is that these folks are running at the behest of the former president. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=233.64s)]
*  He's interested in folks who are going to be loyal to him instead of the will of the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=239.28s)]
*  voters. And there's the potential for them to do real harm and actually overturn the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=243.0s)]
*  will of the voters in future elections if they're elected. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=249.24s)]
*  And so we have to stop them. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=251.68s)]
*  Can I ask you about the break in at your campaign office this week? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=253.84s)]
*  I mean, what have you learned about it? Because your opponent, Carrie Lake, said that the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=256.8s)]
*  break in was staged. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=260.32s)]
*  And I want to give you a chance to respond to that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=261.88s)]
*  I think it says a lot about her lack of leadership, that her first response to this incident [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=264.32s)]
*  in this incredibly vitriolic political climate where we're seeing political violence [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=270.24s)]
*  across the spectrum, that her first response was to accuse me of faking it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=276.32s)]
*  This was absolutely not a fake break in. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  It was it's being investigated by police. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=283.84s)]
*  A person was arrested. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=285.96s)]
*  And and her first response was not to denounce this kind of activity, but to to call me a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  liar. And, you know, this is just another instance where it shows her disqualification [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  to be a leader of our state instead of calling out this kind of political violence that we're [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=301.2s)]
*  seeing, the voter intimidation that we're seeing at Dropbox is that you mentioned she [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=307.0s)]
*  is continuing to egg it on. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  Can I ask about the debate here for a moment? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=314.68s)]
*  You refused to debate Carrie Lake. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  Can you talk to us about your decision and what you say in response to the critics who [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=319.12s)]
*  say that was the wrong move? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=323.56s)]
*  We've called out candidates on the Republican side who have refused to debate their Democrats [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  in other races across this country. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=330.12s)]
*  Why did you not want to debate her head to head? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=332.52s)]
*  You know, her entire platform for running for governor has boiled down to Trump's big [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=336.64s)]
*  lie and her furtherance of that big lie, accusing me of of of fraud in the last election [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=342.8s)]
*  and then continuing to gin up these kind of political attacks. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=350.12s)]
*  And I just simply am not going to give her a bigger stage to do that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=353.68s)]
*  And I've chosen to make my case directly to voters in town hall style interviews. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=357.92s)]
*  And that's that's that's the way we're going to continue for the next 10 days. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=364.96s)]
*  Are you at all surprised by how close this race is given the fact that she is an election [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=368.8s)]
*  denier and gone down that road of of lying about the twenty twenty election, making that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=373.32s)]
*  the central issue of her campaign? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=379.12s)]
*  Arizona is a battleground state. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=381.8s)]
*  And so, no, I'm not I'm not surprised at all. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=383.8s)]
*  We knew that it was going to be a tough fight and a close race. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=387.08s)]
*  When I won in 2018, it was by less than one percent. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=390.88s)]
*  Joe Biden's margin of victory here was less than half a percent. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=394.52s)]
*  And and so it's a fight to the finish. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  We're not taking a single vote for granted. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  And we're going to continue to make the case to voters of how dangerous Carrie Lake is, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=405.24s)]
*  how bad she will be for the state of Arizona, and that I'm the right person to lead the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=409.96s)]
*  state into the future. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  So much of our conversations, rightfully so, have been about election denialism and our [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=416.56s)]
*  democracy and the threats to voters. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=421.4s)]
*  I do want to give you a chance to talk about your platform here, the issues that feel that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=423.52s)]
*  you feel matter the most to your voters. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=428.24s)]
*  What do you think is the most important issue in front of your constituents day in and day [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=430.2s)]
*  out? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think it is very clear that democracy is on the ballot, and I certainly don't want [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  to minimize that as an issue. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=440.24s)]
*  It's something I talk to voters about every day. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  But Arizonans are really feeling the pinch from inflation. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  We've been hit really hard in Arizona, largely because of rising housing prices. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  And so Arizonans are feeling the pinch. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=456.4s)]
*  It's why we've put out a plan to help them put money back in their pocket with tax breaks [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=458.28s)]
*  on everyday items, some proposals that would put Arizonans back to work by expanding access [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  to child care and tax credit for pursuing career and technical education and an income [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=469.66s)]
*  tax cut for 800,000 Arizonans with a child tax credit. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=476.38s)]
*  Those are the kinds of plans we're putting out to help ensure Arizonans that we have [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=480.5s)]
*  answers to the economic struggles they're feeling right now because of inflation. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=485.5s)]
*  Kerry Lake's plans do nothing to address inflation. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=490.42s)]
*  In fact, economic experts have looked at them and said it would make it worse and would [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=493.62s)]
*  actually cripple cities in their ability to provide public safety for their residents. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=498.94s)]
*  Arizonans are concerned about public education and making sure that we're investing dollars [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc0_Fl5GDU&t=505.26s)]
