# Rep. Melanie Stansbury: 'The GOP is in total disarray.'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68)
*  You can run, but you can't hide. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=0.0s)]
*  That is a lesson Republicans are learning this week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=4.74s)]
*  After facing fire from both the left and the right, Florida Senator Rick Scott has now [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=7.9s)]
*  amended his proposal to sunset all federal legislation every five years. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=12.44s)]
*  Scott's plan now specifies exceptions for Social Security, Medicare, National Security [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=17.82s)]
*  Veterans, benefits, and quote, other essential services. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=23.7s)]
*  Scott's new proposal also includes this bolded section which reads, quote, note to President [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=27.94s)]
*  Biden, Senator Schumer, and Senator McConnell. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=33.34s)]
*  As you know, this was never intended to apply to Social Security, Medicare, or the U.S. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=35.86s)]
*  Navy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=41.46s)]
*  Well, the White House quickly hit back. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=42.46s)]
*  Congratulations to the Senator for, quote, joining the post-State of the Union red wave [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=45.02s)]
*  of Republicans acknowledging that they have in fact been attempting to put Medicare and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=50.06s)]
*  Social Security on the chopping block. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=55.02s)]
*  But Scott isn't the only Republican attempting to distance himself from his party's unpopular [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=57.940000000000005s)]
*  policies this week. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=62.74s)]
*  So far both candidates seeking the Republican presidential nomination have ignored a major [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=64.58s)]
*  issue on the campaign trail, abortion. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=68.9s)]
*  During her presidential launch speech this week, Nikki Haley made no mention of the issue [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=72.18s)]
*  that was once central to conservative politics in America. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=76.4s)]
*  In fact, here's my colleague, Craig Melvin, trying to pin down exactly where the former [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=79.5s)]
*  governor now stands. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about abortion for a moment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=87.42s)]
*  The senior senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, has proposed a federal ban on abortion. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=88.62s)]
*  Would you sign that? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=94.14s)]
*  We need consensus on this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=95.14s)]
*  Our goal- Consensus on abortion. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=97.22s)]
*  Would you support a federal ban? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=99.64s)]
*  I think we- not a full out federal ban because I don't think that's been put on the table. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  I think what Lindsey Graham has put on the table is 15 weeks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  And I think if we're looking at 15 weeks, what we need to understand is we are not okay [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=108.66s)]
*  with abortion up until the time of birth. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=113.42s)]
*  And so we should at least decide when is it okay? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=116.56s)]
*  All right, so you'll notice Haley never really answers the question. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=119.7s)]
*  But the truth is she's not alone. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, who remains the GOP's front runner in most polls, has also thus far largely [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  avoided discussing abortion at his campaign appearances. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=131.5s)]
*  Now it's no surprise that Republicans are ignoring the issue since their position is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=135.02s)]
*  highly unpopular. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=139.3s)]
*  As we all know now, it is part of the reason why the GOP had such an underwhelming and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=141.14s)]
*  frankly embarrassing midterm performance. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=146.61999999999998s)]
*  An NBC News national exit poll found abortion was the number two issue for voters in November. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=149.61999999999998s)]
*  And those who cited it as their top concern preferred Democrats over Republicans by a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=155.05999999999997s)]
*  staggering 53 points. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=160.77999999999997s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=163.54s)]
*  You can't distance yourself from positions you currently hold. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  So the Republican Party can try to rewrite history as much as they want. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=168.58s)]
*  They can talk in circles as much as they want. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  But their record on this is clear. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=173.9s)]
*  Let's bring in Democratic Congresswoman Melanie Stansberry of New Mexico. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=177.06s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us this evening. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=180.38000000000002s)]
*  First, let me get your reaction to what we saw from Senator Rick Scott, his what about [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=182.66000000000003s)]
*  fascism if you will, his reversal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=189.06s)]
*  Did he really need a State of the Union call out to realize how unpopular, promising to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=191.54000000000002s)]
*  get entitlements is with the American people? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=197.06s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on tonight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=200.22s)]
*  I mean, listen, the GOP is in total disarray right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=202.82s)]
*  They are pandering completely to the extremists in their party. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  And I think we can see the evidence everywhere that their agenda is so hugely unpopular with [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=210.38s)]
*  the American people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=216.3s)]
*  Millions and millions of Americans depend on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=218.06s)]
*  Just the idea that we would cut these basic benefits that our seniors across the country [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=223.78s)]
*  depend on as a lifeline every day is absolutely absurd. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=228.26s)]
*  So whether it was a call out at the State of the Union or the continued work that we're [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=232.14s)]
*  doing in Congress on the Oversight Committee and every day to make sure that the American [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=236.62s)]
*  people know this is their extreme agenda, we have to hold them to account and make sure [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=240.78s)]
*  that they are not able to execute any of these ridiculous plans. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=245.34s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember Republicans running on curtailing abortion rights for decades, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=249.82s)]
*  I think every single election in my lifetime. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=255.5s)]
*  And after finally achieving their goal and reversing Roe, why do you think they are suddenly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=258.22s)]
*  running away from the issue on the campaign trail, barely even mentioning or celebrating [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=261.98s)]
*  the fact that they were able to achieve it? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=266.26s)]
*  Well they're running away from it because of the extremism and the unpopularity of it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=269.78s)]
*  The right to control our own bodies is a fundamental right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=274.98s)]
*  It's a human right, it's a constitutional right and the upending of Roe vs. Wade upended [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=279.38s)]
*  over 50 years of settled law and as soon as they did it, the American people shouted that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=284.06s)]
*  this is not what we want. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=290.74s)]
*  In fact the entire world did and so now of course the extreme GOP is trying to distance [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=292.38s)]
*  themselves from the very policies that they've spent decades espousing and trying to put [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=297.3s)]
*  forward. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=301.94s)]
*  But you know I'm lucky enough I actually represent a state in New Mexico where abortion care [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=302.94s)]
*  remains safe and legal, where we are actually helping those states around us and that is [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=307.62s)]
*  what the American people want. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  That is what they are asking us to do is to protect our democracy, to protect our rights [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=314.3s)]
*  and to protect our right to control our own bodies. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=319.42s)]
*  Let me ask you about some of your colleagues in the Republican Party. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=322.22s)]
*  You sit on the House Oversight Committee, your colleagues are Republican colleagues, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=324.9s)]
*  they put together a subcommittee to investigate the origins of the coronavirus. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=328.3s)]
*  However they're not alone. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  We've got the House Energy and Commerce Committee also investigating that very same topic. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  Do you think, you know, does this just double the risk of dangerous COVID related conspiracy [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=339.04s)]
*  theories and misinformation reaching the American public at this time? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  Oh absolutely. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=349.16s)]
*  I think one of the shocking things that we're seeing right now with the GOP disarray is [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  not only do they not have a agenda for governing, they're using the resources of our Congress [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=355.88s)]
*  to espouse conspiracy theories that are not only fraudulent but dangerous for the American [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=363.36s)]
*  people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean think about the beginning of the pandemic and the Trump administration getting in front [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  of the camera every day telling the American people all sorts of lies, conspiracy theories [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=374.8s)]
*  and health risks that put Americans lives on the line. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=380.12s)]
*  The continued use of American resources, our congressional resources to do that is not [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=385.2s)]
*  only dangerous, I believe it's fraudulent. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=390.04s)]
*  Our job on the Oversight Committee is to oversee the waste, fraud and abuse of government resources [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  and I think that what we're seeing right now is the use by the GOP of congressional resources [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=399.6s)]
*  to commit waste, fraud and abuse to advance their political agenda. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  And speaking of their political agenda and conspiracy theories, you saw firsthand in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=409.68s)]
*  your own state of New Mexico how these fringe beliefs can in fact turn violent. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=413.88s)]
*  In December election conspiracy theories drove a defeated Republican candidate to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=420.2s)]
*  hire gunmen to attack the homes of Democratic legislators. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  How fearful are you that Republicans will mainstream these kinds of ideas over the next [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=428.8s)]
*  two years? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=434.24s)]
*  And do Democrats have a plan to counter that message? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=435.24s)]
*  Yeah, so listen, speech has consequences and the continued use, especially of our media [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=438.88s)]
*  and government resources to continue to put out hate speech, to use those resources to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  undermine our basic democratic values is a continued threat to our democracy. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=453.44s)]
*  And we saw that in New Mexico, a candidate who lost his race by a significant margin [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  hired gunmen to go and shoot up the houses of elected officials and in particular on [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  the election board that oversaw elections. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=469.96s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  It continues to pose a danger to our local electoral systems. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=474.08s)]
*  And that continued use of speech to undermine our democracy is a real threat to our institutions. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  Democrats have a clear agenda. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=485.92s)]
*  We are going to use our time in Congress to make sure that we are shoring up and protecting [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=487.86s)]
*  our democracy or democratic institutions, passing legislation that actually protects [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=493.36s)]
*  them that we're putting into place. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=498.16s)]
*  You know, the ability to protect voting rights across the country and of course to continue [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNKpv3HZ68&t=501.40000000000003s)]
