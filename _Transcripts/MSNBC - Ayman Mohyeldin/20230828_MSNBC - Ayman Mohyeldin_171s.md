Video Description: Each time the rainbow Pride flag was torn down from Laura Ann Carleton's storefront, she put up an even bigger one, and the 66-year-old had to buy quite a few replacements in the two years she operated her clothing boutique. Last week, Carleton's allyship got her killed after a gunman was enraged by her public display of support for gay and trans Americans. MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin eulogizes a beloved Californian and mother of nine.

# LGBTQ ally killed in dispute over Pride flag
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc)
*  Every single time the pride flag was ripped down from Laura Ann Carlton's storefront, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=0.0s)]
*  she put up an even bigger one. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  And the 66-year-old had to buy quite a few replacements in the two years she operated [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=9.52s)]
*  her clothing boutique. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=14.32s)]
*  The cost, though, it never bothered her, nor did the occasional harsh word from her conservative [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=16.12s)]
*  neighbors in Cedar Glen, California, a small, politically purple town in the San Bernardino [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=20.68s)]
*  Mountains. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=25.96s)]
*  In the words of one of her daughters, she was fearless and a fierce ally of the LGBTQ [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=26.96s)]
*  community. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=32.72s)]
*  Laura, Lori, two loved ones, was killed last Friday. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=33.72s)]
*  She was fatally shot by a man who first spewed a host of disparaging remarks about the rainbow [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=37.88s)]
*  flag that stood outside the store, according to the county sheriff's department. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=43.0s)]
*  The gunman, who we will not name, was later killed in a confrontation with law enforcement. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=47.96s)]
*  Lori, by all accounts, was beloved by her community. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=53.2s)]
*  And earlier this year, after a massive blizzard struck Cedar Glen, Lori and her husband converted [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=56.36s)]
*  their shop into a relief center and actually provided free food for those in need for months. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=62.12s)]
*  The only person directly responsible for Lori's death is, of course, the killer. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=68.16s)]
*  Cannot tie his actions to the homophobic rhetoric of conservatives like Donald Trump or Ron [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=74.48s)]
*  DeSantis or even far-right pundits who, for years now, have worked to, quote, make the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=78.76s)]
*  pride flag toxic. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=83.52s)]
*  But when you ban saying gay in schools and demonize trans kids and paint queer people [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=86.0s)]
*  as groomers, you end up with hate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=90.64s)]
*  And hate can lead to action. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=94.0s)]
*  And it can lead to more tragedies like Lori's. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  There's been a surge in anti-LGBTQ demonstrations and attacks in recent years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=100.92s)]
*  They have quadrupled by some measurements. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  According to a report from GLAD and the Anti-Defamation League, there have been more than 350 anti-LGBTQ [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=107.68s)]
*  incidents in just the last year. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=115.0s)]
*  Of course, bigotry comes in many forms. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=116.64s)]
*  A different kind of bigotry just led to the deaths of three people, three black people [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=119.36s)]
*  in Jacksonville, Florida. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=124.36s)]
*  But we cannot cower or hide from this hate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=126.08s)]
*  The bigots win if we do that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=129.12s)]
*  So we must keep the memories of people like Laura Ann Carlton close to us and the people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=131.6s)]
*  who died in Florida close as well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=136.32s)]
*  And then we must stand up to that hate loud and clear. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=139.18s)]
*  And whenever possible, we must put up a bigger flag. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwi7BotLDc&t=142.4s)]
