# Texas dad pledges to “fight” after wife’s nightmare miscarriage experience
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8)
*  Before the break, we shared the heartbreaking story of the Hamiltons, a Texas family that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=0.0s)]
*  was denied proper medical care during a miscarriage due to the state's strict abortion ban. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=5.2s)]
*  Ryan Hamilton recounted his family's nightmare experience in a post on X, which has since [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=10.56s)]
*  been viewed more than 15 million times. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=15.3s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=18.44s)]
*  Ryan, it's great to have you with us on the show. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=19.8s)]
*  First of all, I'm so sorry it is for this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=22.7s)]
*  And first off, Happy Father's Day to you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=28.88s)]
*  More importantly, how's your wife doing after this nightmare? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=29.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=34.8s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=35.8s)]
*  I'm okay. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=36.8s)]
*  She's getting better every day. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=37.8s)]
*  It's a long road. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=39.4s)]
*  And when you've been through something like what they put her through, it's not just the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=40.64s)]
*  rest of your life knowing that you lost a baby. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=45.28s)]
*  It's the rest of your life having to live with this torturous experience that she has. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=48.66s)]
*  So it's the very beginning of a very long road, but I'm just I'm amazed at how strong [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=56.04s)]
*  she is and, you know, how she's so determined to get back to normal life. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=60.24s)]
*  That seems to be her way of getting through it, just trying to get back to normal, whatever [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=66.96s)]
*  that is now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=72.1s)]
*  But thank you for asking. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=73.56s)]
*  We're okay. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=75.56s)]
*  I don't want to say we're good because we're not there yet, but we're doing okay. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=77.24s)]
*  Well, we're certainly praying for you and pulling for you and your wife. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=82.4s)]
*  We can't even imagine what this has been like. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=86.12s)]
*  And as we explained before the break, you know, since the fall of Roe, we have seen [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=88.6s)]
*  many brave women speak out about their experience seeking care in states with these very restrictive [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=92.48s)]
*  bans. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=99.12s)]
*  But you're one of the few certainly most high profile men that I'm aware of, at least, who [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=100.12s)]
*  have been vocal about how this issue has impacted you and your family. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=105.28s)]
*  Talk to us about what motivated you to make that first post on X and share that experience [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=110.56s)]
*  with the world. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=115.92s)]
*  What were you hoping to do with it? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=116.92s)]
*  Well, first of all, I didn't know it was rare for a man to speak out about this until [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  I did. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  And it's gone the way that it's gone. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  And I find that confusing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  I don't know why more men aren't speaking out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=128.36s)]
*  We all have mothers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  We have wives and daughters and sisters. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  I was shocked to find out that this was a rare thing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=136.16s)]
*  And I think that that's something that needs to change. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=140.56s)]
*  And what I really wanted to do, honestly, was just tell the people that keep up with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  me and our family what happened. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  I had no intention of it going viral or, you know, reaching millions of people. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=155.56s)]
*  And now that that's happened, I've been thrown into this situation that I never wanted to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=163.08s)]
*  be in, if I'm being honest. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=170.0s)]
*  But I'm here now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  And something happens to you whenever you discover your wife unconscious and you don't [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=174.28s)]
*  know if she's alive or she's going to be OK. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  Something inside of me changed in that moment. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if it's some sort of fatherly instinct. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=190.04s)]
*  We have a nine month old daughter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=193.44s)]
*  But since then and since that post has gone the way that it's gone, all I want to do is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=195.44s)]
*  fight and fix the problem and make sure my wife never has to go through that again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=201.6s)]
*  And this is not the world that my daughter has to grow up in. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=210.32s)]
*  Do you know if I mean, can you certainly share with us whether your views on this have changed? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=216.72s)]
*  I mean, abortion is an essential component of women's health care. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=222.27999999999997s)]
*  As you were saying, this was not your intention when you first started sharing this post. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=226.44s)]
*  But in some ways, it has now become this moment, certainly a teachable moment for the country [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=230.6s)]
*  or perhaps even a call to action. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=235.6s)]
*  Is that something you realized purely after living through this experience? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  Do you think your story can, in fact, open people's eyes to the harm these restrictions [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  are causing for women and men and their families? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, you, of course, hear the stories of these women having to cross state lines and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=251.56s)]
*  you have those conversations at home at dinner, talk about how sad it is or how wrong it is. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=256.68s)]
*  But until you're thrown into that situation yourself, your views are just kind of on the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=263.92s)]
*  outside of that situation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=270.92s)]
*  And then when you're in the middle of it, it definitely has changed our views. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=275.32s)]
*  And people do not understand how bad it is and how scary it is. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=280.48s)]
*  And I have I had to learn and I'm better now, but the ignorance of people on X who [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=287.84s)]
*  want to fight, who want to attack me and my family, say that we're liars, that this is [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  political propaganda. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=303.28s)]
*  Do you know how hard it was to share a post that we lost a baby, let alone this horrific [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  experience? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=311.4s)]
*  So not only has my view changed, I now know how clueless a lot of people in Texas and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=312.52s)]
*  America are. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  They don't understand. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  I get so frustrated with the argument that that has nothing to do with the law. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=323.28s)]
*  The law clearly states this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=329.12s)]
*  If the law clearly stated what these people are arguing, then there wouldn't be countless [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=331.64s)]
*  stories. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=338.2s)]
*  There wouldn't be situations like what happened to my wife happening time and time again. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=339.4s)]
*  The law is the problem. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=344.56s)]
*  I don't understand why that's so hard for people to understand. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  Last I checked, doctors were pretty smart people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=351.92s)]
*  They had to go to school for a long time and be pretty intelligent to pass the tests they [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=353.9s)]
*  have to pass to become a doctor. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  So their argument is what? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=360.76s)]
*  The doctors don't understand the law, so it's just malpractice running rampant? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=364.32s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=370.12s)]
*  So yes, my views have changed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm angry about it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=373.44s)]
*  And I don't understand why these people are digging their heels in going, nah, it's really [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=375.4s)]
*  fine. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=381.44s)]
*  It's the doctors. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=382.44s)]
*  It's the law. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=383.68s)]
*  Ryan, as I said, this is extremely difficult. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=385.68s)]
*  I can't thank you enough for sharing your story with your followers, with the world, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=389.84s)]
*  with us on this program. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=395.2s)]
*  We certainly hope that it continues to raise awareness and perhaps, perhaps change the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=396.4s)]
*  laws in your state and elsewhere in this country. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=400.38s)]
*  Ryan Hamilton, thank you so much. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=402.92s)]
*  As I mentioned, we're praying for you and your wife. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUnWPLK0O8&t=404.84s)]
