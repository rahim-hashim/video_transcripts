# Sen. Graham Flip-Flops On State’s Rights, Proposes National Abortion Ban
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94)
*  I want to take you back to June 2022. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=0.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court had just overturned Roe vs. Wade, striking down the constitutional [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=5.36s)]
*  right to an abortion in this country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=9.64s)]
*  The decision immediately left millions of Americans without access to reproductive rights [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=11.94s)]
*  or reproductive care. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=16.56s)]
*  And in states where that care was protected, millions more wondered if it was just a matter [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=18.2s)]
*  of time until a federal ban would go into effect. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=23.42s)]
*  Some Republicans, fearing an electoral disaster in the coming months, were quick to throw [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=27.16s)]
*  cold water on that theory, claiming the court's decision would simply send the issue back [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=31.48s)]
*  to the states. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=36.74s)]
*  Effectively, these GOP lawmakers said a national ban on abortion? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=38.24s)]
*  That would never happen. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=42.76s)]
*  Here is Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina just last month. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  I've been consistent. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=49.8s)]
*  I think states should decide the issue of marriage and states should decide the issue [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=51.14s)]
*  of abortion. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=55.34s)]
*  I have respect for South Carolina. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=56.7s)]
*  South Carolina voters here, I trust, to define marriage and to deal with the issue of abortion. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  Well, that respect for the state of South Carolina appears to be short-lived. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=64.10000000000001s)]
*  Here's Lindsey Graham on Tuesday unveiling a new bill. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=69.42s)]
*  I think we should have a law at the federal level that would say after 15 weeks, no abortion [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=73.62s)]
*  on demand. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=81.78s)]
*  Now, blatant hypocrisy aside here, even other Republicans realize that Lindsey Graham's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=83.74s)]
*  proposal is in good politics. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=87.82000000000001s)]
*  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who's facing an uphill battle to gain control of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=90.98s)]
*  the chamber in November, told reporters, quote, most of the members of my conference prefer [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=94.54s)]
*  that this be dealt with at the state level. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=98.72s)]
*  This isn't a shock, because public opinion is not on Graham's side, especially in battleground [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=102.18s)]
*  states like Pennsylvania. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=107.04s)]
*  That's where Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz is being blasted by his Democratic [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=108.7s)]
*  opponent John Fetterman for refusing to say whether he'd vote yes on Graham's bill. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=112.54s)]
*  Fetterman has even dedicated an entire section of his website to what he calls OzWatch, where [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  he counts the days, minutes, and seconds it's taking Oz to come clean about his stance on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=124.66s)]
*  the proposal. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=129.82s)]
*  Mitch McConnell is a master politician. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=131.1s)]
*  He knows not to endorse a federal abortion ban just weeks before the midterm, but it's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  telling that many other Republicans are willing to make that endorsement, including Georgia [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=137.7s)]
*  GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=142.38s)]
*  And in the House, Republicans just introduced even more legislation to restrict abortion [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=145.38s)]
*  nationwide, bringing forward a bill that would undo Biden administration guidance and allow [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=149.26s)]
*  pharmacists the power to refuse to provide abortion-inducing drugs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=154.18s)]
*  The state's rights line of defense we heard so much about, well, it was a lie. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=159.66s)]
*  It was nothing but a lie. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=165.1s)]
*  And those who claim otherwise are most likely doing so just to save their electoral prospects [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=166.86s)]
*  come November. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=171.86s)]
*  As Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal put it, overturning Roe was never about giving power back to the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=173.22000000000003s)]
*  states. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=177.82000000000002s)]
*  It was about controlling our bodies and our personal autonomy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=178.82000000000002s)]
*  Let's bring in Georgia Democratic State Senator Jen Jordan. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=183.78000000000003s)]
*  She's the Democratic nominee for attorney general of Georgia and Monica Simpson, executive [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=186.5s)]
*  director of Sister Song, a reproductive justice collective. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=190.02s)]
*  She was part of a group of activists who met with Vice President Kamala Harris at the White [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=193.26s)]
*  House earlier this week. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=197.14s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=198.82s)]
*  State Senator Jen, I'd like to, Jordan, I'd like to start with you, excuse me. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=201.17999999999998s)]
*  Let's be clear about what I at least think what Graham's proposed federal law would do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  Right now, your home state of Georgia has a six-week ban on abortion, which would be [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=209.66s)]
*  allowed to stay in place, but in less restrictive states, abortion access would be absolutely [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=214.1s)]
*  curtailed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  What kind of legal battles could arise if Graham's bill actually became law? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=220.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=225.94000000000003s)]
*  And I think that there needs to be clarification because I've even heard pundits talk about [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=226.94000000000003s)]
*  Graham's bill as if it just creates a 15-week ban, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=233.02s)]
*  There's some people in Georgia were saying, well, that's good for us, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  But what they don't understand is that 15 weeks across the board, unless the state has [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  a more restrictive law, and that's the one that goes in place. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=247.38s)]
*  I mean, let's be clear in terms of Lindsey Graham and Republicans, period. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=250.98s)]
*  They want states to control the decisions about abortion if they control the states, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=262.3s)]
*  And so, you know, I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen, but I think that Lindsey [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=263.3s)]
*  Graham really let the cat out of the bag in terms of what the real intention here is with [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  Republicans nationwide after Dobs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=272.94s)]
*  Monica, some Republicans have described a 15-week ban as a moderate alternative to other [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=276.06s)]
*  restrictions, as we just heard there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=280.86s)]
*  But this means that patients seeking abortion care after 15 weeks will no longer be able [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=283.42s)]
*  to go to another state for the procedure. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=288.06s)]
*  They'll have to travel basically to another country. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=290.66s)]
*  Talk about the impact this proposal could have, especially among those who can't afford [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=294.26s)]
*  to make that trip. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=297.82s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=301.1s)]
*  And I will say that I want to make it very clear that what we saw this week was an attempt [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=302.14000000000004s)]
*  to move a national abortion ban. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=307.26000000000005s)]
*  I think that sometimes when we hear 15 weeks versus however many other weeks, like people [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=309.26000000000005s)]
*  try to put in front of that ban, what we saw here was the move for a national ban. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=314.74s)]
*  And this will absolutely have incredible impact on communities of color, on low-income folks, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=319.82000000000005s)]
*  and it will make it nearly impossible for people to be able to make safe decisions for [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=325.94s)]
*  themselves and to be able to determine how they want to live their lives. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=329.22s)]
*  State Senator Jordan, Graham claims that his bill has exceptions for the life of a mother, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=334.02s)]
*  rape and incest. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=339.18s)]
*  But as the 19th notes, these exceptions, they actually require people to jump through [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=340.06s)]
*  significant logistical, legal and bureaucratic hoops that render them nearly impossible to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=345.06s)]
*  utilize. Can you talk to us about some of these? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=350.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and look, let's, and I want to go back here because what we're talking [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=354.18s)]
*  about, and Monica is exactly right, I mean, this is a ban nationwide. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  So when we talk about states that have really been much more supported with respect to women's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=363.02s)]
*  rights, you know, let's talk about New York, let's talk about Illinois or California, those [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=371.02s)]
*  are the states that are going to get impacted by Lindsey Graham's bills, not the Georgia's, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=376.3s)]
*  the Georgia, you know, six week ban is going to stay into effect. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=380.54s)]
*  And so what's going to happen is the states where people actually can access abortion [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=384.22s)]
*  care and where women's rights are intact, that's what Lindsey Graham's bill really seeks [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=389.18s)]
*  to destroy. And that's why the national ban is so incredibly dangerous. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=395.34000000000003s)]
*  Monica, I mentioned that you met with Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  earlier this week. Based on what you discussed during that meeting, is the White House, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=405.82s)]
*  in your opinion, in your mind, ready to meet this moment? What steps would you like to see [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=411.18s)]
*  from the federal government to protect abortion access nationwide? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=416.94s)]
*  I will say that we are ready and it was very, it was an incredible meeting that we had at the White [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  House. And it seems as if the Biden administration has made incredible moves, not even seems, they [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=427.58s)]
*  have made incredible moves towards being in alignment with where we know we need to be to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=432.94s)]
*  ensure that people in this country are able to make their own decisions about their reproductive [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=437.42s)]
*  lives. And what we are going to continue to do is to continue to ask this Biden administration to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=441.58s)]
*  put the pressure where the pressure needs to be, to put the safeguards where the safeguards need [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=446.86s)]
*  to be and continue to move the resources in the places that we need them so that people can get [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=451.1s)]
*  what they need and to really address and continue to push in all the ways possible to make sure that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=456.14s)]
*  people are not criminalized from making a healthcare decision in this country. That's [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=461.74s)]
*  what we're going to continue to push. We have a strong collective force of advocates across [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=466.3s)]
*  different sectors, across different movements who are ready to move and ready to act in this moment. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=470.7s)]
*  State Senator, I want to ask you about this uncharted legal territory that we're in. After [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=476.06s)]
*  Roe fell, a 2019 fetal personhood law took effect in your state, meaning basically that a fetus now [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=480.46000000000004s)]
*  has the same constitutional rights as a person. And if I recall at the time you argued against [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=487.34s)]
*  the law and suggested that Georgia would be required to pay public benefits to the fetus [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=494.3s)]
*  of an immigrant woman, even as it now denies those benefits to her because any person born in the U.S. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=498.62s)]
*  becomes a citizen automatically. Tell us about this uncharted legal territory that we're finding [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=504.78s)]
*  ourselves in. Yeah, here in Georgia, basically an embryo is a person under Georgia law. And so if [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=511.1s)]
*  you think about all the rights that are attendant with being a person under the law, I mean all of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=518.0600000000001s)]
*  it, whether you're talking about social welfare benefits, whether you're talking about due process, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=523.1s)]
*  you know, riding in the HOV lane. I mean, I know that's been kind of batted around in the press, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=528.62s)]
*  but that is really what's at issue here. And we already have the Department of Revenue issuing [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=533.82s)]
*  guidelines in terms of deductions, tax deductions that women can take when they become pregnant, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=540.22s)]
*  even if then they miscarriage or if they have multiple miscarriages. So it's one of these things [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=546.3000000000001s)]
*  that this has really opened the Pandora's box in this state. And look, Lindsey Graham's, you know, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=551.26s)]
*  national ban is just the beginning. I mean, we saw with Congressman Buddy Carter from Georgia [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=557.98s)]
*  where he is filing a bill that basically is going to let pharmacists refuse to fill [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=563.5s)]
*  prescriptions for birth control, for contraception. That's where we are and that's where they're [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=569.26s)]
*  headed. And so voters, women, everybody in this country needs to be vigilant and needs to understand [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=574.7s)]
*  exactly where they're going with this. Monica, I want to ask you about just how we talk about [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=581.34s)]
*  this in this country for a moment. And it's switching gears here a bit because at that meeting [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=585.26s)]
*  with the White House, you touched on the role pop culture can play in the discussion around [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=589.98s)]
*  reproductive rights. And this week you had Chrissy Teigen sharing that the miscarriage that she had [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=595.42s)]
*  back in 2020 was actually a life-saving abortion, something that she didn't even realize herself [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=600.14s)]
*  until the fall of Roe. She said, quote, I felt silent, feeling weird that I hadn't made sense [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=605.0999999999999s)]
*  of it that way. I told the world we had a miscarriage. The world agreed we had a miscarriage. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=611.9799999999999s)]
*  All the headlines said it was a miscarriage. And I became really frustrated that I didn't in the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=617.18s)]
*  first place say what it was. And I felt silly that it had taken me over a year to actually [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=621.66s)]
*  understand that we had had an abortion. Has the Dobbs decision helped normalize these kinds of [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=626.4599999999999s)]
*  candid discussions around abortion? And is that what we need to have in this country? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=634.9399999999999s)]
*  We absolutely need and I do believe that this decision has brought the topic of abortion to [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=641.3399999999999s)]
*  the front. It is not something that we are able to push to the side anymore. If you are looking [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=647.5s)]
*  to do anything in terms of policy in this country, you have to address abortion. We need not only [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=653.74s)]
*  reproductive justice voters, we also need reproductive justice candidates, those folks [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=658.86s)]
*  who are willing to stand strong on these issues. And so because of the Dobbs decision, we are seeing [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=663.1s)]
*  so many more of these stories coming to the forefront and we need more of that. And I do [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=667.58s)]
*  think the power of culture, the power of storytelling is something that is absolutely [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=672.78s)]
*  needed. People need to see themselves reflected. They need to understand that their stories are not [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=677.1s)]
*  theirs alone, that they share stories with so many other people. So I absolutely believe that's [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=681.26s)]
*  something we have to invest in and continue to uplift. Yeah, you can't emphasize that enough. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=685.8199999999999s)]
*  You are not alone. That is the importance of sharing these stories. Georgia Democratic [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  State Senator Jen Jordan and Monica Simpson, thank you so much for joining us this hour. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=693.66s)]
*  I greatly appreciate your time. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2vYPeW6V94&t=697.5s)]
