# State attorneys general on reproductive rights
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg)
*  New developments in the fight over medication abortion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=0.0s)]
*  This week, the nation's second largest pharmacy chain, Walgreens, announced that it will no [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=6.04s)]
*  longer dispense abortion pills in states where Republican leaders object to the medication, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=10.36s)]
*  even if the medication remains legal there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=16.0s)]
*  The move comes after nearly two dozen Republican state attorneys general threatened Walgreens [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=19.2s)]
*  with legal action if abortion pills continue to be distributed in their states. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=24.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general are now suing the FDA for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=29.04s)]
*  unnecessarily singling out the medication abortion drug, excuse me, mephepristone with excessive [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=33.84s)]
*  regulation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=42.16s)]
*  Three of the state attorneys general who signed on to that lawsuit join me now, Delaware Attorney [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  General Kathy Jennings, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, and Arizona Attorney General [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=48.8s)]
*  Chris Mays. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=53.96s)]
*  And one day I'm going to get the name of that medication right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=54.96s)]
*  Attorney General Rosenblum, I'd like to start with you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=58.2s)]
*  This lawsuit that you are co-leading against the FDA. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=61.28s)]
*  Tell us why. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=64.56s)]
*  Why are you calling for restrictions to be dropped on medication abortion? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=65.56s)]
*  Well first of all, you can just call it MIFI because I think that's what a lot of people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=72.56s)]
*  are referring to it as. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  And then there's also my some pro Paul. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=78.2s)]
*  So there's mephepristone and my some profile. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=81.2s)]
*  Drugs are the gold standard for medication abortion and they are also used with regard [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=83.52s)]
*  to miscarriages and other kinds of complications of pregnancy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  So this is a very important combination of drugs. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, primarily for political reasons, we believe the REMS have been applied to this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=98.6s)]
*  drug mephepristone unnecessarily. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=105.64s)]
*  And we are we have brought this lawsuit. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=109.08s)]
*  We have a great coalition of unfortunately, it's all Democratic attorneys general, but [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=111.52s)]
*  wonderful colleagues two of whom are with us this afternoon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=116.36s)]
*  And we have brought this lawsuit because what we believe in is access to health care. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  And we believe that abortion is health care. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=125.32s)]
*  We believe that this lawsuit will help providers, will help patients to be able to obtain access [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=128.5s)]
*  to medication abortion, which has been proven to be safe for the last 20 years. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=135.12s)]
*  It has been used regularly in every state in the country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=140.84s)]
*  So we are doing everything that we can to ensure access to these drugs and these REMS [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  slow down access. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  They don't present prevent access, but they they're a strategy of the FDA that is not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=151.56s)]
*  required for this drug. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=156.84s)]
*  It is a safe drug. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  It is proven to be safe. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  So we're really proud to be bringing this lawsuit with my fantastic colleagues here [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=165.28s)]
*  Attorney General Mays, let me ask you about Walgreens for a moment. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=166.28s)]
*  What's their reaction to their decision to no longer dispense abortion pills in states [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=168.8s)]
*  where Republican leaders object to the medication, even if it is up until this moment legal in [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=174.8s)]
*  those states to do so? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=180.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  And we are among those states who have actually encouraged Walgreens and CVS and other pharmacies [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=184.52s)]
*  to continue to offer the medication despite that pressure by Republican AGs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=193.08s)]
*  But you see you see in that that effort by those GOP attorneys general to continue to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=199.32s)]
*  try to limit the access of women to abortion in every possible way they can find. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=209.0s)]
*  And despite the fact that Roe was overturned and it was sent back to states, they're still [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=221.96s)]
*  making these efforts in states to limit a woman's access to abortion. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=227.08s)]
*  And that's why these actions by Democratic AGs largely are so important. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=232.84s)]
*  We're going to continue that fight going forward. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=238.72s)]
*  And we've got a big Texas case coming up where we're fighting for the access to these two [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=241.56s)]
*  medications. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  They're so crucial. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  General Jennings, what are your thoughts on the Walgreens decision? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=250.12s)]
*  Because it came after, as I understand it, this coalition of 24 attorneys general sending [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  a letter to both CVS and Walgreens supporting their decision to offer abortion pills in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=258.16s)]
*  their pharmacies after the FDA granted their certification. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=263.16s)]
*  Iman, thank you for having us on tonight. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=267.4s)]
*  And as my colleagues have indicated, we do not support Walgreens decision. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=272.24s)]
*  And we hope that by fighting back and by calling out their decision to limit access in all [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=278.48s)]
*  of these states, some of whom do not allow abortion, some of whom allow access to abortion. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=288.0s)]
*  But that means that women in those states where they can legally obtain an abortion, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=296.68s)]
*  including medication abortion, can't get the necessary medication from their pharmacies. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=302.36s)]
*  And so what we saw in Kansas, for example, was that the voters in Kansas overwhelmingly [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  voted in a referendum to support abortion rights. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=317.68s)]
*  And that is one of the states where the Republican attorney general has asked Walgreens, urged [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=322.0s)]
*  Walgreens and CVS to limit access. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=328.04s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=331.84s)]
*  It's not legal. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=333.08s)]
*  And we need to make sure as attorneys general that we continue to protect access to abortion [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=334.36s)]
*  and more specifically and recently access to medication abortion. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=341.2s)]
*  Nationally, it is used in the majority of abortions in our country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=347.8s)]
*  In my state of Delaware, it's used in over 60 percent of abortions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=353.92s)]
*  And so it's incumbent upon Democratic attorneys general to band together. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=358.68s)]
*  And we have under the leadership of Ellen Rosenblum and Bob Ferguson to make sure that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  Jennifer Christone is accessible to as many women who need it in this country as possible. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=371.96s)]
*  Attorney General Rosenblum, I want to ask you about, you know, we can all agree that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=379.76s)]
*  the space for women's rights are shrinking in this country. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  And yet you recently launched Oregon's reproductive rights hotline, which is actually trying to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=387.0s)]
*  counter that, trying to provide free legal counsel to patients seeking abortion care. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=391.52s)]
*  Talk to us about that step. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=397.24s)]
*  What kind of reception it has had? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=398.84s)]
*  What kind of legal advice can be offered in a country or in states that we're seeing or [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=401.56s)]
*  witnessing where these rights are shrinking by the day? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=406.44s)]
*  Well, I'm going to give a shout out to my colleague, Kathy Jennings, because we actually [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=409.56s)]
*  copycatted her. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=415.32s)]
*  Her state was ahead of us, along with New York. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=417.12s)]
*  There are a lot of these abortion rights, reproductive rights, really much more expansive [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=419.68s)]
*  than abortion hotlines now, because we want to make sure that anybody who's confused or [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=424.64s)]
*  has questions has a place to go to get their questions, their legal questions answered. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=429.90000000000003s)]
*  We've had a good response. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=435.78000000000003s)]
*  Actually, we're trying to get the word out because we are concerned that we haven't had [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=437.62s)]
*  as great a response as we should have. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=441.26s)]
*  But let's face it here in Oregon, we are one of the states with the fewest actually no [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=443.5s)]
*  restrictions on abortion. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=449.54s)]
*  But we wanted to make sure that people weren't confused by dobs and what the impact of dobs [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=451.26s)]
*  would be in our state. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  And in fact, we have a task force that is recommending legislation, because even in [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=457.46000000000004s)]
*  a state like mine, we need to do a lot to ensure access, to ensure the safety and the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  protection of our providers and our patients. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=468.02000000000004s)]
*  There's so much that you have to do, even in a state like this, that it's quite frightening [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  to think about what it would be like in a state where we frankly where we don't have [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=474.86s)]
*  Democratic AGs working together the way the three of us and the rest of our colleagues [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=478.46000000000004s)]
*  are. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=482.94s)]
*  Attorney General Mays, I was talking to my colleague, Alicia Menendez, on the top of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=483.94s)]
*  the show about how things that are happening in states may affect the rest of the country [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=486.7s)]
*  and we shouldn't ignore them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=490.58s)]
*  You have a Texas Republican lawmaker who just introduced a bill that seeks to ban access [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=492.18s)]
*  to websites that sell or provide information on how to obtain abortion pills. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  And we could say it's hyperbolic. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=505.26s)]
*  We could say it's not going to affect the rest of the country. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=506.94s)]
*  We can ignore that our own peril. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=508.9s)]
*  But could that actually happen where now just the information itself, hotlines, information, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=510.58s)]
*  websites can become illegal? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=516.54s)]
*  I mean, that is the danger. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=518.62s)]
*  And I'll just add that I am about to stand up a reproductive rights unit in my office, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=523.3s)]
*  following my colleague's example, to address this very type of scenario. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=529.66s)]
*  You know, if you have a state like Arizona that has a Republican legislature, thankfully [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=535.86s)]
*  we have a Democratic attorney general and a Democratic governor now who will stop that [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=541.3s)]
*  kind of thing. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=547.5s)]
*  But in those states that have both Republican legislatures and governors, that's the kind [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  of thing that we have to be worried about. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=554.9399999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, I have been clear here in Arizona that we will never prosecute a woman, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=557.26s)]
*  a doctor, a nurse, a midwife for abortion. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=563.38s)]
*  But we have 15 county attorneys in Arizona. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=569.34s)]
*  And I've been clear also that I will fight any effort by a county attorney to prosecute. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=572.6600000000001s)]
*  We are concerned about what could happen going forward or interference by third parties against [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=579.5400000000001s)]
*  the efforts of a woman to seek an abortion. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=589.58s)]
*  So those are exactly the kinds of things that we need, strong AGs thinking about being [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=593.46s)]
*  prepared to take legal action in support of these core constitutional rights. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=601.34s)]
*  Attorney General Jennings, I wanted to pivot for a moment and ask you about your efforts [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=609.9000000000001s)]
*  to end your state's opioid epidemic. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=613.86s)]
*  You recently secured a staggering $43.6 million settlement from CVS and Walgreens for overprescribing [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=617.18s)]
*  dangerous opioids. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=625.54s)]
*  Talk to me about how consequential this settlement is for your state and for people across this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=627.38s)]
*  country. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=632.62s)]
*  This settlement is extremely consequential. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=634.8599999999999s)]
*  It is the latest round of our efforts across the country on a bipartisan basis to hold [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=638.14s)]
*  accountable manufacturers, distributors and now nationwide pharmacies for their role in the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=646.1999999999999s)]
*  opioid epidemic. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=653.64s)]
*  In our state, in our small state, we have several small towns. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  In the town of Selbyville, which is a very small town in Sussex County, Delaware, our [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=660.28s)]
*  southernmost county, there were more pills, opioid pills dispensed in that town four times [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=665.24s)]
*  over the population of the town. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  And that was on a yearly basis over and over. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=678.48s)]
*  And we had to call a stop to this behavior. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=682.2s)]
*  And so the settlement brings in much needed dollars for abatement to help people desperately [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=686.0400000000001s)]
*  in need to get more facilities set up in our state and to get more access to the care that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=692.76s)]
*  people need, including Narcan and including treatment and making sure that they're housed [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=701.8s)]
*  and transported. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=708.1199999999999s)]
*  So this money will all be put to those very important purposes. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=709.3599999999999s)]
*  And the need for this money is urgent. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=715.1199999999999s)]
*  It's urgent in Delaware. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=717.16s)]
*  It's urgent across our country. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51qLY0UZvdg&t=718.4s)]
