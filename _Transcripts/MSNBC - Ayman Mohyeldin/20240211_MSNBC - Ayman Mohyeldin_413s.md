# Matt Gaetz says he misses Kevin McCarthy after House GOP's humiliating week
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE)
*  Ten minutes of public humiliation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what House Republicans endured during two back-to-back failures this week. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=2.6s)]
*  First, when they couldn't round up the votes to impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=7.2s)]
*  And then, when they failed to pass a GOP-led package for $17.6 billion in aid to Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=12.1s)]
*  The double losses were a huge embarrassment for Speaker Mike Johnson, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=18.8s)]
*  who's already been warned that some House Republicans get oust him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And the Mayorkas fiasco could be the last straw for some members of his party. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=25.7s)]
*  According to the messenger, one senior GOP aide said of Johnson, quote, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=29.8s)]
*  if we lose the Israel vote after losing Mayorkas' impeachment, vacate. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  Kurt Burdella and David Jolly are back with me now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=39.2s)]
*  Kurt, how much worse can it get for Speaker Johnson? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=42.300000000000004s)]
*  I mean, what does his future look like right now? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=46.8s)]
*  Is that a trick question? I don't even think there's a right answer for that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Try. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=55.5s)]
*  Every time that we think that it can't get worse for House Republicans, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=57.3s)]
*  and whoever is in that Speaker's chair, they show us that it can get worse, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=61.3s)]
*  that it can get more embarrassing, more humiliating. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=66.0s)]
*  I think that there is no scenario in which Speaker Johnson is still the Speaker of the House [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=69.2s)]
*  by the end of this year. It's no different than what Kevin McCarthy went through. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=74.0s)]
*  It's no different than why Paul Ryan left. It's no different than why John Boehner left. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=77.0s)]
*  This is an ungovernable conference. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=81.0s)]
*  The Republicans right now, as they are currently constituted, who have no interest in governing, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=83.1s)]
*  who have no interest in fulfilling the basic responsibilities of being a member of Congress, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=87.1s)]
*  which is to effectively fund the government and to keep the government running, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  they don't want to do that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=94.3s)]
*  And so anyone who is in that position, who does anything that would resemble responsible governing, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  gets run out of town. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=100.8s)]
*  OK, but David, Johnson is, of course, unsurprisingly trying to downplay all this criticism, right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=102.3s)]
*  One of the things that he said is, I don't think that this is a reflection on the leader. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=108.8s)]
*  It's a reflection on the body itself and the place where we've come in this country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=113.3s)]
*  So David, is there any truth to that at all? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=117.6s)]
*  Like, if we're actually trying, trying to see his side, is there any truth to that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=120.1s)]
*  I mean, is what we're seeing a reflection of the way that Trump has hijacked the party? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=124.0s)]
*  And he sort of has his arms stuck. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=127.7s)]
*  Yeah, it is a reflection of the level of partisanship with which the Republican majority, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=132.5s)]
*  majority has decided to behave because they only have a one or two vote majority. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=137.7s)]
*  And so maybe you don't get your super conservative priorities, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  but you do have a responsibility to govern, to keep the government open, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  to address crises both internationally and on our border. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  And because of the inability of Republicans to govern, this is a reflection of where we are. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=152.7s)]
*  But Mike Johnson ran for speaker saying he would accept responsibility, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  so he doesn't get to pass it off to the rest of his caucus. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=162.6s)]
*  The only thing that is saving Mike Johnson right now is nobody else wants his job [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=165.7s)]
*  because nobody, everybody knows that they couldn't do it either. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  And ironically, it got harder for Mike Johnson this week [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=174.0s)]
*  because Mitch McConnell capitulated at Donald Trump as well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  And I know that sounds odd. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=181.6s)]
*  It would seem like if Mike Johnson and Mitch McConnell both capitulated, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=183.0s)]
*  then that works better. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  It really doesn't because what Mike Johnson needs is for the Senate Republicans [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  to shove legislation down his throat so he can say to House Republicans, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=194.5s)]
*  I've got no choice. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=198.9s)]
*  We just don't have the numbers to push back against our own party in the Senate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=199.9s)]
*  Mitch McConnell caved this week and that made governing that much harder. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=204.3s)]
*  But the buck stops with Johnson and the buck stops with McConnell [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=208.2s)]
*  and there's no passing it off to anybody else. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=211.3s)]
*  Right. I think Kurt, in many ways, Matt Gaetz, right, took us to this moment, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=213.6s)]
*  He very much led the Republican Party to oust Kevin McCarthy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=218.9s)]
*  But the interesting thing is that suddenly you have Gaetz having some form of virus remorse, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=223.4s)]
*  Because right after the Mayor gas fiasco, Gaetz said, and I'm quoting him, he said, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=229.6s)]
*  I also wonder, wouldn't it have been nice to still have Kevin McCarthy in the House of Representatives? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=233.1s)]
*  Honestly, that's something I never thought I would hear coming from him. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=239.5s)]
*  Oh, brother. I mean, be careful what you wish for. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  You just might get it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=247.5s)]
*  I mean, when you follow Matt Gaetz, a person who at the very best is of questionable integrity, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=249.2s)]
*  as we're seeing some of the other investigations that he is currently the subject of, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=255.4s)]
*  this is where you end up. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=258.8s)]
*  You know, the Republicans are proverbially the, you know, the dog that caught up to the, you know, to the bus [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=260.4s)]
*  and then they're shocked when the bus runs them over and over and over again. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=264.7s)]
*  How many times are they going to have to repeat this history before they wake up and realize, you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=268.8s)]
*  if you want to be in quote, leadership, that actually means leading. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=273.2s)]
*  It doesn't mean passing the buck off to your caucus. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=277.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean blaming other people. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=279.4s)]
*  It's take responsibility, step up, and act. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  Everybody always says they could do a better job than the current leader, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=283.29999999999995s)]
*  but when they actually get into that position, they do just as bad of a job as a person before. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=285.5s)]
*  And so it makes you wonder, why did you throw out McCarthy in the first place [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=290.0s)]
*  if you were going to end up in exactly the same place as you were before that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=293.4s)]
*  And that's what we're doing right now, looking at these two government shutdown deadlines coming up here [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  in the first week of March. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=301.2s)]
*  Right. I think, David, you know, we can laugh all we want. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=302.4s)]
*  There's reason to do that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=305.9s)]
*  But the international community is looking at the United States and saying, what is happening? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=307.5s)]
*  Right. I mean, I think this congressional dysfunction goes beyond domestic politics, as you know, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=311.5s)]
*  and it can have very real national security implications. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=315.7s)]
*  So what do you think is the collateral damage all of this can have in Ukraine, in the Middle East, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=318.29999999999995s)]
*  in the eyes of the international community? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=323.5s)]
*  What does that look like from that side? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, the stakes and the consequences are very serious. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  It's a very serious risk to have the failure of a governing coalition within the Republican majority. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=332.2s)]
*  And ultimately, however we get there, it will be Democrats that provide the votes to govern [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=336.4s)]
*  and to pass hard legislation with some reservations of their own on the left [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=342.0s)]
*  when it comes to providing aid to Israel, supporting Ukraine. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=347.2s)]
*  They have tried to solve the issue on the border. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=350.5s)]
*  Look, it has always been for the past two years a governing coalition of Democrats [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  who have actually governed, not Republicans. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=357.4s)]
*  And so the question becomes the fate of Mike Johnson. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, if he wants to take the safe route to governing right now, he should tell his caucus, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to stand for speaker next Congress, and then just work with Democrats [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=367.3s)]
*  to actually pass the legislation he's ultimately going to have to pass. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=371.90000000000003s)]
*  Mike Johnson may not want this job in the next Congress, but ultimately, Joe Biden and House Democrats [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  and Senate Democrats are going to provide the votes to responsibly provide aid for the international community [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=382.70000000000005s)]
*  as well as fund our own domestic priorities here at home. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=387.9s)]
*  Republicans are just going to have to swallow the medicine on that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zgc2_e9oGE&t=391.09999999999997s)]
