Video Description: As Israel’s onslaught in Gaza continues, it gets less and less public attention, and the images of carnage run the risk of becoming normalized. Journalist and author Omar El Akkad has been covering Gaza and a deeper betrayal of so-called Western values in the Middle East and here at home. He joins MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin to discuss Gaza, the press, and his new book, 'One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This.'

# 'One day, everyone will have always been against this': author speaks out on Gaza
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA)
*  Before the break, I discussed the very latest Israeli atrocities in Gaza, including this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=0.0s)]
*  morning's bombing of Al Ahly Hospital, atrocities that get less and less media attention and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=7.12s)]
*  have almost become normalized. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=12.26s)]
*  Journalist and author Omar Al-A'ad has been covering this closely and has a powerful new [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=14.42s)]
*  book out called One Day Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=18.34s)]
*  Omar, the title of your book comes from this post on X back on October 25th, replying to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=24.14s)]
*  a horrific video of the destruction of Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=30.66s)]
*  You wrote back then, one day, when it is safe, when there is no personal downside to calling [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=33.34s)]
*  a thing what it is, when it is too late to hold anyone accountable, everyone will have [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=39.06s)]
*  always been against this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=43.94s)]
*  Can you take us back? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  Can you take yourself back to your mindset there 18 months ago when you wrote that? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  When did you foresee coming back then? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=52.82s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=55.82s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=56.82s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=59.42s)]
*  I have never been much of a social media guy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=60.42s)]
*  I would sort of tweet once a month back then, and I don't do any of that stuff anymore. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=63.38s)]
*  So I didn't think that that tweet would get the traction that it did, obviously. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=67.9s)]
*  But to me, it was a function of pattern recognition more than anything else. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=73.42s)]
*  It's very difficult today to find someone who will tell you that they were proudly pro-South [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=78.1s)]
*  African apartheid or pro-segregation in this country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=82.86s)]
*  And what has changed is not the grotesqueness of the event or the act. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=88.3s)]
*  It's that enough time has passed where it is now socially unacceptable not to have been [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=93.5s)]
*  against that in hindsight. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  One of the things that I've realized since the book has come out is that a lot of people [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=102.86s)]
*  sort of read that title and think that I mean next week or something like that when we're [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=106.28s)]
*  talking about an occupation that has been going on for three quarters of a century. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=110.78s)]
*  I don't know if I'm going to live long enough to see that day as it relates to the treatment [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=116.02s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  But everything I've seen of these kinds of moments in history lead me to believe that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=124.5s)]
*  it is coming. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=129.14s)]
*  You know, for those who have read your book, it is not simply about Gaza. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=130.9s)]
*  I mean, the title, as you mentioned, is applicable to anything. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=135.26s)]
*  It's an American story, an immigrant story about a belief in American values and really [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=138.1s)]
*  Western values that you've been a journalist for 20 years here in the United States. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  You've reported on things like Black Lives Matter, the Ferguson protests, the war on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=145.7s)]
*  terror, and now you weave into it what is happening in Gaza. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  At what point did that belief in so-called Western values start to fray for you? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=153.98s)]
*  I mean, I tend to think of it in terms of the same way that Hemingway's characters went [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  bankrupt, you know, little by little and then all at once sort of thing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=166.62s)]
*  I realize that it's very much seen as a book about Israel and Palestine. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=170.86s)]
*  Of course, I almost certainly would have not written this book were it not for the slaughter [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  in Gaza over the last year and a half. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=180.38000000000002s)]
*  But I think of it very much as a book about this part of the world and about what it means [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=183.06s)]
*  to exist as a liberal, as a mainstream centrist in this part of the world and what you sort [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=189.3s)]
*  of have to look away from in order to make that calculus work on a moral level. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=197.18s)]
*  You know, before you and I started talking, I was on the Zoom call, you know, watching [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=203.82s)]
*  the previous segment, the monologue, and I'm watching these images of human beings who [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=208.62s)]
*  have been subjected to the worst things. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=216.7s)]
*  I'm watching what human beings can do to one another. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=218.74s)]
*  I'm watching children begging for food. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=221.5s)]
*  And the expectation is that in the three-minute commercial break between then and now, I will [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=225.02s)]
*  have quickly regained my composure and killed off whatever part of me is human enough to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=231.3s)]
*  be affected by this such that we can have this conversation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=236.66000000000003s)]
*  I think there's a version of that that is going on throughout this country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  I've been out for two and a half months doing book events where we talk about these things. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=246.06s)]
*  And after every event, almost without exception, there's somebody who will come talk to me [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=251.06s)]
*  for whom none of this has existed for the last year and a half, because they, like me, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=255.34s)]
*  like you, live in a part of the world where there is essentially no downside or repercussion [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=261.3s)]
*  to looking away. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=267.06s)]
*  And I think that, to me, has more to do with what this book is about than anything else, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=268.5s)]
*  this privilege of living on the launching end of the missiles and having essentially [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=275.1s)]
*  no consequences of not caring about where those missiles land or what damage they do. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=280.5s)]
*  How does that change? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=287.06s)]
*  What do you think, based on what you have seen, what you have witnessed, how do we as [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=289.22s)]
*  a society change that, where these images that we're seeing coming out of Gaza can [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=294.86s)]
*  have an impact, can have a change on the way our policymakers, our society functions in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=300.1s)]
*  relation to it? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=306.38s)]
*  I mean, there was an awful attack by Russia and Ukraine today. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=307.38s)]
*  Ukrainians were killed. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=311.82s)]
*  There's a disparity in the coverage of what is happening to Ukrainians versus what is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=315.22s)]
*  happening to Palestinians. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=318.22s)]
*  And I'm curious to get your thoughts on that as well. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=319.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really good question. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's difficult for me to answer that question without sort of admitting my [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=326.26s)]
*  own complicity in all of this, because my natural tendency as somebody who has benefited [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  from living on this side of the planet for a very long time is to try and appeal towards [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=335.18s)]
*  some distant future where these horrors are coming to your doorstep and my doorstep, which [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=342.1s)]
*  is to say, you know, the quadcopter that snipes a Palestinian kid today will soon be employed [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=347.74s)]
*  in this part of the world at some point if you don't stand up and do something about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=357.85999999999996s)]
*  But again, the implicit part of that statement, which is sort of unsaid but very much implied, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=358.85999999999996s)]
*  is that, yes, right now it's happening to somebody who doesn't matter, but you need [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  to do something about it because one day it'll happen to somebody who does matter, which [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=369.38s)]
*  again is a very morally bankrupt way to try and establish a moral position. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  So I think for me the way we change this is to understand that the damage being done to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=379.54s)]
*  our souls and to our conscience by looking away from this right now is present and current [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=385.26s)]
*  and is not going to go away. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=391.66s)]
*  And this administration and coming administrations are going to take advantage of that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=393.46s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=397.02s)]
*  And as I was saying earlier, the banality of evil falls upon all of us not to just sit [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=398.02s)]
*  by and watch as this type of atrocity becomes normalized. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=402.86s)]
*  Omar Al-Aqqaiyat, the book, One Day Everyone Will Have Always Been Against, it's an incredible [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=407.29999999999995s)]
*  read. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  I encourage everyone to read it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much, Omar, for joining us. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  I greatly appreciate it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mySXBIYMA&t=414.65999999999997s)]
