# Ayman Mohyeldin knocks down the GOP’s 'For the Kids' arguments
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs)
*  In 1959, the official newspaper of the Citizens Council of America published this political [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=0.0s)]
*  cartoon. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=9.6s)]
*  It shows a teacher angrily pointing at a student while reading from a textbook titled A Child's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=10.6s)]
*  Guide to Integration. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=15.56s)]
*  In the background, you can see a flyer for an NAACP rally and a chalkboard that reads [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=17.52s)]
*  2 plus 2 equals 6 and white equals black. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=22.32s)]
*  The Citizens Council, commonly referred to as the White Citizens Council, was formed [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=26.6s)]
*  in 1954 in response to the Supreme Court-mandated desegregation of U.S. public schools. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=31.28s)]
*  The group believed that the federal government's influence on their children's education was [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=37.32s)]
*  a gross overreach, arguing that desegregating schools posed a threat to their rights as [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  parents and their religious and cultural values. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=46.74s)]
*  The article accompanying that cartoon blasted, quote, progressive educators for indoctrinating [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=50.86s)]
*  children with false ideas about race. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=56.44s)]
*  It has been more than six decades since that cartoon was published, and although the target [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=60.28s)]
*  of the outrage has somewhat shifted since then, the playbook remains exactly the same. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=65.56s)]
*  Adults using children as pawns to advance their political agenda, no matter the harm [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=71.6s)]
*  it might cause. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=76.8s)]
*  In the name of saving the kids, GOP-led state legislators and governors have launched book [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  banning campaigns prohibiting school libraries from offering books they claim are somehow [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=83.86s)]
*  harmful to children. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=89.3s)]
*  They've passed laws restricting how public school teachers can speak about issues like [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=91.14s)]
*  race, gender, sexual orientation, claiming the lessons would cause discomfort for some [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=95.3s)]
*  students. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=101.1s)]
*  In Florida, for example, the state Senate just passed a bill that could give courts [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=102.1s)]
*  the power to remove transgender children who receive gender-affirming care from their parents' [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=105.58s)]
*  custody. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=111.38s)]
*  In South Carolina, Republicans are pushing a bill that would categorize fertilized eggs [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=112.38s)]
*  as people under state law, meaning anyone who obtains an abortion could be charged with [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  homicide and, yes, therefore eligible for the death penalty. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  So in the eyes of people who believe abortion is murder, their answer is also murder. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=127.78s)]
*  That seems to be the sacrifice some are willing to make here on the right, being willing to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=134.56s)]
*  harm some for a perceived greater good. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=139.7s)]
*  And oftentimes, the people being harmed are children. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=142.33999999999997s)]
*  Just this week in Missouri, as lawmakers were debating a bill that would ban all gender-affirming [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=146.1s)]
*  care for transgender children, a move many experts say could lead to increased suicide [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=150.6s)]
*  rates among an already vulnerable population, one Republican suggested that children as [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=155.38s)]
*  young as 12 years old should be allowed to get married. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=160.88s)]
*  Is that in the interest of the greater good? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  Free teens being allowed to wed. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=169.3s)]
*  The willingness to harm some for a perceived greater good also leads Republicans to inaction. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=172.34s)]
*  After a shooter terrorized the Covenant School in Nashville, killing six people, including [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=178.38000000000002s)]
*  three children, Republican Congressman Tim Burchard of Tennessee was asked what role [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  Congress should play in preventing the next school shooting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=187.46s)]
*  His response? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=191.78s)]
*  It is a horrible, horrible situation, and we are not going to fix it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=193.62s)]
*  So when it comes to children getting massacred at schools, there's no solution. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=199.38s)]
*  The Congressman seems to willing to sacrifice some school children for that perceived greater [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=204.46s)]
*  good. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=210.18s)]
*  It is worth noting that Republicans at the state level spent months pushing a drag show [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=211.22s)]
*  ban in Tennessee, claiming those performances somehow put kids at risk. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=216.02s)]
*  But nothing can be done to stop school shootings. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=221.18s)]
*  The GOP has for decades tried to brand itself as the party of family values. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=225.1s)]
*  The Republicans have a documented record of denying crucial support to families in need. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=230.62s)]
*  2021, every single Republican in the House and Senate voted against expanding the child [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=235.82s)]
*  tax credit despite the fact that it was found to slash child poverty rates to record lows. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=240.9s)]
*  And research shows that states that have all but banned abortion access have among [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=246.78s)]
*  the nation's weakest social services for women and children and have higher rates of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=251.3s)]
*  death for infants and mothers. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=256.58s)]
*  Does that sound like a pro-child agenda for you? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=259.94s)]
*  What's the greater good here for Republicans? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=263.78s)]
*  For decades, children in this country have been used as pawns. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=266.46s)]
*  Their safety only of importance when it is deemed politically convenient. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=269.46s)]
*  And it's always some children whose safety is deemed important. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=274.7s)]
*  It's never all children. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=278.26s)]
*  And that's because it has never actually been about protecting children for Republicans. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=280.38s)]
*  It's about protecting their own political interests at the expense of those children. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFlBsoUkMs&t=284.62s)]
