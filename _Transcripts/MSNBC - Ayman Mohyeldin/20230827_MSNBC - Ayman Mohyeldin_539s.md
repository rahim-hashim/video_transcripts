# Comedian roasts Trump, DeSantis, Ramaswamy, McConnell and more with spot-on impressions
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw)
*  All right, forgive us for picking the obvious choice here, but our worst of the week has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=0.0s)]
*  to go to the entire 2024 Republican field. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=6.54s)]
*  And the one person we just had to speak with about this debate, disaster is comedian and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=8.9s)]
*  friend of the show, Matt Friend. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  Matt, great to see you, bud. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=16.94s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=18.54s)]
*  I am so excited. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=19.54s)]
*  By the way, let's just tell our viewers that I think we reached out to a month ago when [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=20.54s)]
*  we know that the debate was happening and we're like, if there's one person we need [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=24.64s)]
*  to speak to about this, it's got to be you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=28.3s)]
*  So you knew some crazy stuff was about to go down. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=30.5s)]
*  Call it an intuition, journalistic intuition. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  But I got to ask you, so Donald Trump did not appear in the debate. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=35.14s)]
*  What do you think he was thinking watching? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=40.54s)]
*  You are such a nasty guy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=41.54s)]
*  You tee that up on the after the mug shot, which is so bad what you're doing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=43.54s)]
*  This is MSNBC. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=47.5s)]
*  They lie like dogs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=48.58s)]
*  You can ask them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=49.66s)]
*  They lie like dogs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=50.66s)]
*  And I will tell you, you don't do a debate when you're up by 60 points, 60 points. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=51.66s)]
*  You don't debate these people, these clowns, the horrible people. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=55.62s)]
*  And you would know that if you watched my Tucker, which was a great conversation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=58.86s)]
*  But there was no point in debating against Rob DeSeguimonious and Vavuk, who's just a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  nasty guy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=67.1s)]
*  Some are saying you're related probably, but that's who knew they gave him a show, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=68.1s)]
*  But Nikki Haley, who's a witch and Mike Pence, Mike Pence is just failing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=72.42s)]
*  So you don't do that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=76.84s)]
*  You don't do that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=78.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=79.34s)]
*  What a bad guy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=80.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=81.34s)]
*  You're a terrible person. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=82.34s)]
*  You talk about character. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  Get me out of it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=88.10000000000001s)]
*  I don't know how to be honest. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=90.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=91.86s)]
*  So you talk about Ron DeSantis. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=92.86s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, some people said he was the real loser in this debate. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=93.86s)]
*  What do you think he was thinking throughout all of this? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=98.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, well, look, first of all, here's what matters most. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=101.18s)]
*  OK, when I become the president, come high noon on Jan 20, I take the oath of office. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=104.14s)]
*  You don't coddle someone like Fauci. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=109.16s)]
*  You sit him down and you say, Anthony, you are fired. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=111.5s)]
*  I will not let you down. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=117.86s)]
*  OK, that was Ron's response. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=120.7s)]
*  I just want to know what was going on with the dis- like when he was smiling, was it [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=124.38s)]
*  like a Botox? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=129.74s)]
*  Like it was the most forced smile. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=130.74s)]
*  He's a politician that never has grown into a natural role. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=132.74s)]
*  He doesn't do retail politics well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=136.86s)]
*  He doesn't have like the kind of comfortable level of just moving his hands. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=138.8s)]
*  Like Mitch McConnell, you know, just comfortable. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=142.44s)]
*  He puts his hands on his waist. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=144.28s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=145.84s)]
*  You know, it's just so weird. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=146.84s)]
*  You know, what he does is, you know, he kind of moves his arms like in the same accordion [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=147.84s)]
*  style motion, but his voice is more back here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=151.12s)]
*  He's like Trump without personality is what he is. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=154.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=156.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, let's talk about the breakout star, according to some, as you just called them, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=157.72000000000003s)]
*  Vavuk, but Vivek Brahmaswamy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  And also stealing a line from Barack Obama, not very original. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=164.84s)]
*  Well, I'm working on the Vivek, but no, I was- he's just- I can't wait for him to announce [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=168.84s)]
*  his new campaign slogan. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  He's just like, well, first of all, some of you might be wondering why I'm here tonight. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=175.8s)]
*  And that is because I'm just a skinny guy with a funny last name who's eager to share [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=179.4s)]
*  my new campaign slogan. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=184.56s)]
*  Yes, we can. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=186.12s)]
*  I invented that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=187.56s)]
*  I think Obama would be upset, actually. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=190.96s)]
*  But Vivek Brahmaswamy, Melania Trumped that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=194.04s)]
*  Full on just taking his moves. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=196.72s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=198.44s)]
*  Is it hard for you to study these guys or are they just- they all have such distinct [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=199.88s)]
*  characteristics that for you it's just so easy to kind of pick up on that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=203.8s)]
*  I mean, honestly, a lot of them are just in my mind so much. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=207.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm watching them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=209.92s)]
*  Are you traumatized? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=210.92s)]
*  Do you- like does- I mean, when you have to sit there- [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=211.92s)]
*  When I see DeSantis try to smile, that's the traumatizing or McConnell freezing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=214.04s)]
*  But no, honestly- [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=219.36s)]
*  What do you do to like just get- do you like take a cold shower and just- [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=220.76s)]
*  Just be like, I gotta wash this off of me because like you're walking around all day. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=223.4s)]
*  No, honestly, it's just these are guys are like actors basically. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=226.56s)]
*  It's like I'm watching a movie, which I know is a frightening thing to say because this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=229.08s)]
*  is politics and they're dramatically impacting our lives. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=232.44s)]
*  But it's entertainment, honestly, as horrible as it is to say. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=236.16s)]
*  But I feel disgusting. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  One person that we have not heard from this week, Mitch McConnell. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=242.32s)]
*  I would love to know what Mitch McConnell thought of the- [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=247.72s)]
*  What was your question? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=248.72s)]
*  What did you think? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=255.44s)]
*  Mitch, what did you think of the Republican field? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=256.44s)]
*  You've talked about character and integrity being- [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=257.8s)]
*  Well, listen, I think that my party has presented a slew of interesting candidates who I look [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=259.8s)]
*  forward to seeing potentially challenge Job. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=269.16s)]
*  I feel like we have- is this the part where we have to nudge you along? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=273.2s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=279.44s)]
*  I'm making a real call back to the McConnell phrase. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=280.44s)]
*  Joking aside for a moment, and I know that's kind of hard, but genuinely when you look [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=285.56s)]
*  at the field of the Republican party, is there anyone out there that you think you cannot [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=289.24s)]
*  do? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=295.68s)]
*  Vocally? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=296.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=297.68s)]
*  Or just as an impression? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=298.68s)]
*  As an impression. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=299.68s)]
*  Nikki Haley would be really tough to do. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=300.68s)]
*  I think Chris Christie's a little like- there's not much there to pick apart, but I mean DeSantis [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=302.44s)]
*  just kind of has that nasal thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=306.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=308.4s)]
*  I mean, I wish George Santos was running. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=309.4s)]
*  Who would love a little Santos? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=311.64s)]
*  Do you think he was watching that debate thinking like, I can talk my way through this? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=314.24s)]
*  He wants to get in on this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=317.08s)]
*  You think he would? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=318.08s)]
*  But yeah, no, I mean, there's just so many of these crazy figures. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=319.08s)]
*  It's just- it's wild. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's overwhelming, honestly. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know what to do with myself. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  It's like the Academy Awards of politics. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=327.2s)]
*  I saw your mugshot impression of Donald Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=329.16s)]
*  You want to give us a little bit of a- how do you think that went inside the- in the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=333.16s)]
*  jailhouse? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=337.32000000000005s)]
*  Do you think they were like blue steel? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=338.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, first of all, what you're doing is another classic MSNBC setup. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=340.0s)]
*  You're tricking me, and I will tell you that they're locking up their political opponents. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=344.12s)]
*  And you know, some are saying that I am the pregogian of the United States and that Biden [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  is the Putin, because next thing you know, they're going to come for me like that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  And it's very dangerous territory because no one's talking about locking up Hunter [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=356.96s)]
*  Biden and the Burisma laptop. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=360.85999999999996s)]
*  So it's- look at Eamon. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=363.52s)]
*  Eamon. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=364.52s)]
*  Eamon. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=365.52s)]
*  Yaman, like Jamaica. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=366.52s)]
*  And frankly, it's just horrible. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=367.52s)]
*  So they're going to put me behind bars. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=370.06s)]
*  And it's just very unfair, China. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  Very unfair. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  You think they would do that to you in China? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=374.59999999999997s)]
*  I think potentially Xi would do that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=376.52s)]
*  Potentially Xi would do that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=379.24s)]
*  He had a lot of respect for me. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=380.24s)]
*  Tremendous respect. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  How do you think it's going to play out with Trump in the campaign and the indictments? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=384.4s)]
*  I mean, do you think he's becoming more and more unhinged when you're looking at like [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=387.96s)]
*  the social media posts? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=391.0s)]
*  He's going after the prosecutors and the judges, but then he's going, never surrender, and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  like selling mugs. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=397.84s)]
*  I think he's definitely becoming more unhinged, which is kind of hard to imagine, honestly. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=398.84s)]
*  I mean, he just had the whole- he's marketing his mugshot, which obviously we knew he would [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=403.64s)]
*  do. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=408.12s)]
*  And then obviously the whole Tucker interview, where they ranged from everything to Biden's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  skinny legs to if Epstein killed himself, the issues that matter in this country. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=412.88s)]
*  So it appears that he is progressively losing his mind. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=417.64s)]
*  But I would be very interested to see how he performs if he is behind bars, which it's [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=421.2s)]
*  seeming like he will be as the days go on. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  The basement and behind bars, you know? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=429.84s)]
*  Do you think Tucker Carlson- Do you think Tucker Carlson regrets not being at Fox during [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=431.6s)]
*  these presidential debates? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=439.12s)]
*  First of all, I really resent the setup of the question. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=440.2s)]
*  First of all, I think what we should really get down to the important questions such as [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=445.88s)]
*  if Epstein did kill himself, was Joe Biden there with his skinny legs like he is on the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=449.44s)]
*  beach? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  And if he was, why aren't we holding him accountable or throwing him in a jail? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=460.96s)]
*  Let me just- while I have America's attention, what is going on with Tucker's laugh? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=461.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm 25 years old. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=466.0s)]
*  I've never had a prostate exam, but I imagine that's how I might react. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=467.68s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=471.0s)]
*  I can't explain it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm glad that we don't have to hear as much of it anymore, to be honest. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93A12stsMw&t=474.76s)]
