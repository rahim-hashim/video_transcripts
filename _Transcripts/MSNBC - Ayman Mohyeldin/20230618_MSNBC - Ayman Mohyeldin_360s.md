# Celebrating immigrant heritage month
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8)
*  As I mentioned right before the break, this is Immigrant Heritage Month. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to acknowledge the successes and struggles unique immigrant communities have made in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=7.16s)]
*  this country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=11.56s)]
*  Pure Research reports that immigrants make up more than 13 percent of the U.S. population. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=12.56s)]
*  In addition to the cultural richness that immigrants bring to this country, they also [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=17.56s)]
*  bring significant economic gains. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  A study by the National Foundation for American Policy found metro areas with a higher share [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  of immigrants have more dynamic economies and faster job growth. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=27.639999999999997s)]
*  Yet despite those evident benefits, conservatives continue to spew anti-immigrant rhetoric, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  which in turn has resulted in a string of new red state laws targeting immigrant communities. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  Congressman Judy Chu and Congressman Ted Lieu are back with me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=43.36s)]
*  This is something very personal for me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  I myself am an immigrant. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=48.76s)]
*  I came to this country with my parents at a young age. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=49.76s)]
*  And I want to start with you, Congressman Lieu. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=52.64s)]
*  I mean, Thursday marked the 11th anniversary of DACA. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=54.04s)]
*  Thousands of thousands of recipients are still in limbo as they await a federal court decision [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=57.36s)]
*  about where the program stands. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=61.32s)]
*  Have you been participating in discussions on the Hill about the need for comprehensive [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=64.12s)]
*  immigration reform? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=68.72s)]
*  Is there any progress on that? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=69.72s)]
*  Thank you for your question. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=72.68s)]
*  Let me first say what an honor it is to be on this show with you and also with Congresswoman [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=73.68s)]
*  Judy Chu, who is one of the strongest champions of immigration in Congress. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=78.28s)]
*  I am an immigrant as well, and I fully support the DREAM Act. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=82.92s)]
*  And if we put that on the floor of the House, it would pass with by-bars and support. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=87.36s)]
*  Fortunately, Speaker McCarthy is unwilling to do that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=91.84s)]
*  I also fully support comprehensive immigration reform. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  Congressman, Ron DeSantis' controversial Senate Bill 1718 is set to go into effect on July [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=98.16s)]
*  1st. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=104.88s)]
*  This is, no doubt about it, an anti-immigration law that will bar undocumented immigrants [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=105.88s)]
*  from using driver's licenses from other states. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=110.6s)]
*  Florida hospitals will also be required to ask for a patient's immigration status. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=113.44s)]
*  Are you at all concerned that we may see copycat laws popping up across the country after this? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=118.16s)]
*  We see it happen on other issues, whether it's abortion, but we're going to see it in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=122.88s)]
*  Florida. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  Are we concerned that it's going to pop up elsewhere? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=128.04s)]
*  I'm very concerned about it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  There are a spate of state laws that are restricting immigrant rights. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=132.2s)]
*  And actually, another worrisome one that Ron DeSantis just signed is an alien land law, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=137.92s)]
*  which says that persons from particular countries, China, Venezuela, and Cuba, cannot buy land [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=144.72s)]
*  in Florida. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  This goes back to the racist alien land laws that were in this country 100 years ago. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=155.06s)]
*  But can you imagine a real estate agent having to check your immigration papers before they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=161.0s)]
*  could actually sell you a condo? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it is a very sad trajectory that we're on. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=168.76s)]
*  Congressman Lou, we often hear that this country is a melting pot. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=172.52s)]
*  We certainly want to believe that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=176.4s)]
*  But what do you think needs to happen for our collective actions to align with our words? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=177.72s)]
*  Let me just share with you a story. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=184.36s)]
*  Last year, I had the opportunity to talk to a CEO in my district. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=186.6s)]
*  He had a startup company. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=190.12s)]
*  He also happens to be an immigrant. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=191.72s)]
*  And he's making a new computer chip that's faster. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=193.84s)]
*  So at some point, I asked him, how much faster is it? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=196.56s)]
*  And he goes 50,000 times. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=199.28s)]
*  I'm like, whoa. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=201.04s)]
*  And then I thought, huh, we attract the best and brightest. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  Who wakes up around the world and says, hey, I want to go to Moscow? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  No one thinks that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  But they think of coming to the US because we have the rule of law, we have talent, we [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  have resources, and we'll let them execute their idea. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=215.76s)]
*  And that's because we have a free, open, and democratic society. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=219.1s)]
*  And that's going to keep us ahead of our peer competitors. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=222.56s)]
*  Congresswoman, you're the chair of the Asian Pacific American Caucus. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=225.92s)]
*  Can you talk to us about some of the work that you're doing to advance pro-immigrant [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=229.84s)]
*  legislation? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  And how should your party be combating this anti-immigrant legislation that we see in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  places like Florida? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=241.18s)]
*  And certainly, this is going to be an issue that dominates in 2024. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=242.7s)]
*  Well, we have a shortage of immigrants in this country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=246.68s)]
*  Actually, we have this Chips and Science Act. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  We want to increase the amount of production of semiconductors. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=257.0s)]
*  But we don't right now have the people in those fields that can occupy the jobs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=260.3s)]
*  And even though we put money into STEM, we don't have the immediate workers who can do [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=267.48s)]
*  that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=273.68s)]
*  And yet we have people knocking all over our doors from other nations and people who are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=274.68s)]
*  educated in this country who could fill the bill if they're just given their employment [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=279.88s)]
*  visas. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=286.8s)]
*  So, yes, we have bills. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=287.8s)]
*  Actually, I just went to a DREAM Act bill press conference for a bill that was just [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=289.84s)]
*  introduced. I'm also just about to introduce my Reuniting Families Act bill, which will [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=298.56s)]
*  4 million people backlog in the family visas, and there's a 1.5 million visa backlog for [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=307.36s)]
*  employment visas. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=313.04s)]
*  So there are things we can do to fix this problem, and we can move this country forward [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=314.6s)]
*  if we are able to bring these people in. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=321.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, let's hope we can do that in a safe and secure manner for everyone. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  Congressman Liu, Congresswoman Chu, I thank you very much to the both of you for joining [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=328.04s)]
*  us this evening. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=331.8s)]
*  I greatly appreciate your time and your insights, as always. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb0stLK3J8&t=332.8s)]
