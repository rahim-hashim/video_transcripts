# Jocelyn Benson enters Michigan governor's race, condemns 1/6 pardons
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os)
*  Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson had some strong words this week about Trump's pardons for January 6 riders in a statement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=0.0s)]
*  She wrote no matter our politics [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=6.86s)]
*  We should all be able to agree that the tragedy at our US Capitol on January 6 is to be condemned [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=8.6s)]
*  And those who broke the law should be held accountable now for Benson this goes beyond politics [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=14.52s)]
*  It's actually deeply personal a few weeks before January 6 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=19.56s)]
*  She and her four-year-old son were putting up Christmas decorations when dozens of armed protesters showed up outside her home [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=23.82s)]
*  Shouting stop the steal [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  Benson told NPR quote my job is the state's chief election officers to protect and defend our voters every single one of them [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=32.78s)]
*  Regardless of how they vote so my mind focused on that and then my heart focused on my kid [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=39.34s)]
*  Luckily Benson and her family were safe [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=45.7s)]
*  But this wasn't the first time a Michigan official had become a target just weeks earlier a group of far-right [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=47.78s)]
*  Men were charged for plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and stormed the state Capitol there [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=53.58s)]
*  fast forward to today Governor Whitmer is now gearing up to leave office and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=59.34s)]
*  Benson is hoping to take her place as Michigan's next governor [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=64.14s)]
*  Gubernatorial candidate Jocelyn Benson joins me now. It's great to have you back on the show [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=68.38s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=73.22s)]
*  Tell me why madam secretary you decided to choose to run for governor and if elected [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=74.9s)]
*  How would you govern under the threat of a Trump presidency? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=79.54s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me and you know, we're in this era of misinformation and lies where [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=84.38s)]
*  leaders particularly leaders coming from the states have a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=90.5s)]
*  Responsibility to speak the truth and ensure an honest transparent accountable government that can work for everyone. And so I love my job [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=93.98s)]
*  I run this one of the state's largest agencies serving every one of our [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=100.54s)]
*  10.5 million residents making sure their voices are heard their votes count and they can get good customer service [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  And I want all of government to work that well, but in a moment like this where you see [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  powerful billionaires and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  even the president of the United States still peddling lies and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  Using rhetoric that they may not mean to back up with actions, but still make people feel incredibly unsafe [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=121.84s)]
*  Anxious and worried in their own homes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=128.89999999999998s)]
*  We need state officials governors to stand clearly in the line of fire and say not on our watch [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=130.66s)]
*  Will you harm our residents take away our rights and freedoms or do anything to harm the economic security and prosperity of our states? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  And to me that's that's the job of the governor in this moment and that's a job [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=143.17999999999998s)]
*  I'm ready to do are you at all concerned? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=146.66s)]
*  Because I think it can be argued that what happened to you and governor Whitmer were signals that an event like January 6 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=149.14s)]
*  Not only was it coming but now we have seen [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=155.62s)]
*  is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=158.18s)]
*  rewarded with a presidential pardon and that may encourage other people like those who showed up at your house in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=159.46s)]
*  furtherance of a political ideology that you know was [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=165.94s)]
*  ascribed to the president of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=169.5s)]
*  Stopping the steal and you know fake elections and all that the big lie [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=171.66s)]
*  Do you think that pardons like those that we just saw are going to? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=175.46s)]
*  Create unfortunately more threats against public officials like yourself [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=180.5s)]
*  Yes, they will undoubtedly I mean the pardoning was such a stunningly callous disregard for law and order in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  Rooted in still this lie about the 2020 election, which is long-run proven to be an accurate reflection of the will of the people [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=193.62s)]
*  I think you know the action was an affront to democracy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=199.94s)]
*  It's an affront to everything we are as Americans and it will potentially create or reinforce an uptick in violence and threats to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  Election officials and others who are simply just trying to do our jobs and make sure elections are safe and secure for everyone [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=211.34s)]
*  So yes, the lack of accountability is a green light for folks to potentially [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=217.98s)]
*  Repeat the the tragedy of January 6 or worse in the communities around our country [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=223.73999999999998s)]
*  But folks like me and others are going to stand for it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=228.66s)]
*  You know [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  I don't care how powerful or how much money someone has when you come for the voice and the votes of our citizens [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=231.54s)]
*  I will stand in the way every day proudly because that is what our democracy requires [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=236.6s)]
*  Let me ask you more broadly speaking about the kind of election cycles that we find ourselves in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=241.6s)]
*  I mean, we're still doing the post-mortem of this last presidential cycle [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=246.04s)]
*  And yet here you are already announcing that we're running that you're running. Excuse me for a very important position the state of Michigan [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=250.72s)]
*  Are we just constantly in a state our country and offices constantly in a state of? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=259.44s)]
*  Running in elections is that because we need to raise [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=265.24s)]
*  Insurmountable amounts of money to run and that makes it that you're always out there campaigning as soon as one election is over [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  You already start thinking about the next one. I mean, why did you decide to announce now? Maybe is what I'm asking [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=274.84s)]
*  Well a couple of things first [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=279.96s)]
*  the the events of this week starting on Monday with President Trump taking the oath of office and ascending to the presidency again [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  Really did send a message I think to residents in many states across the nation [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=288.96s)]
*  and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  it's one that caused a lot of people a great deal of fear and anxiety and and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  Uncertainty of over what the years ahead will look like but I know in Michigan after the 2016 election [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  What we did next was elect the women of Michigan a trio of women myself Gretchen Whitmer and Dana Nestle and we have stood steadfast [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=305.24s)]
*  To expand and protect reproductive freedoms and make sure democracy prevailed while also cutting costs and making the making the economy work [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=311.68s)]
*  Well for everyone so in my view [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  2024 does not determine what the next few years mean for our state or for our country [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=321.23999999999995s)]
*  What determines that is what we all do next? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=325.44s)]
*  What I'm doing next is running for governor of Michigan because I believe that government should work for everyone and should protect everyone and keep [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=328.11999999999995s)]
*  Folks safe and I think all of us can think about right now what we're gonna do next in this moment [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=334.67999999999995s)]
*  To protect and defend our rights and freedoms as Americans because that's what it's gonna take to protect all of those rights and freedoms [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=339.84s)]
*  In the years ahead [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=346.76s)]
*  You know as I mentioned we're still doing the post-mortem on 2024 [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=348.48s)]
*  But as you look ahead to your own race, Michigan is a very diverse state [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=352.04s)]
*  You have black constituents whose priority is the economy and police brutality [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  You have a lot of Arab and Muslim constituents who are impacted by what has happened in Gaza and in Lebanon and in the Middle East [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  How do you message and how do you put an advance an agenda that kind of meets all these issues? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=367.32s)]
*  That some would argue the vice president Kamala Harris was not successful in doing was not able to win Michigan because of it [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=373.6s)]
*  You know just before I joined you tonight [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=379.96s)]
*  I was actually at an event in Dearborn talking with local leaders and I heard the same things that I've heard talking to folks all [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=381.96s)]
*  Across the state either in northern Michigan the UP and Detroit and Grand Rapids [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=388.32s)]
*  There's a housing crisis in our state where everyone wants to be able to simply afford a home and live in the community that they want [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=392.12s)]
*  Home there's an economic crisis and with our wages are stagnant and cost of living is increasing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=398.68s)]
*  No matter where anyone lives in the state or who they love or who they worship those economic issues cut deep [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=404.0s)]
*  And that's what you need [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  I believe from a governor from a leader [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=411.24s)]
*  And from government in total to make sure we have the backs of everyone in the state that everyone feels safe that you have an economy [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=413.24s)]
*  That works for you that we're working to save people time cut costs and make sure people can afford to live in the communities [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=420.12s)]
*  They want to live in so that'll be my job as governor [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  That's my commitment to every resident of the state no matter who even voted for Democrats Republicans and independents [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=428.0s)]
*  We're all in this together, and we can build a government and an economy that works for everyone [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=433.64s)]
*  You [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMpnmos3os&t=457.88s)]
