Video Description: Democrats were once afraid to campaign on abortion rights. But now that abortion access across the country is under attack, that has changed. This week the House Oversight Committee held a hearing examining the impact of abortion bans and restrictions imposed by Republicans. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the chairwoman of that committee, told MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin why she felt it was important to hold that hearing ahead of the midterm elections.

# Democrats Now Running On Abortion For The Midterms
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4)
*  Joining me now is the chair of that committee, Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for making time for us again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=6.96s)]
*  Why did you want to hold this hearing? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=10.16s)]
*  What was so important about it? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=11.76s)]
*  Because it's on the ballot, this next midterm election, and it's important to women's lives. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=15.44s)]
*  To me, I was astonished that they would roll back 50 years of accepted law, a constitutional [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=21.48s)]
*  right for women to make decisions about their own health care, including abortions, including [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=27.36s)]
*  reproductive health care. And it's really frightening what's happening. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  33 million women have lost access to abortions, have lost that already in our country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  And if they continue, we estimate that 63 million will be at risk. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=46.0s)]
*  I want to play for you and our viewers, one of the witnesses in that hearing, Dr. Bhavik Kumar, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  who is the medical director for primary and trans care at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  had to say, listen to this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Before Ro was overturned, when we were still providing abortion care under SBA, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=69.84s)]
*  I saw a patient who was afraid her abusive partner would find out she was pregnant. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=74.0s)]
*  She was sure she'd made it to the clinic in time to get an abortion. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=78.24s)]
*  She hadn't. She barely made it to the clinic that day without her partner finding out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=81.36s)]
*  Going out of state was unthinkable. She sobbed so loudly, people could hear her in the waiting room. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=85.92s)]
*  Her fate was sealed. She was sentenced by the state to carry that pregnancy to term, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=90.96s)]
*  tethered to her abusive partner to likely endure more abuse. These stories are endless. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, as he said, these stories are endless. But talk to us a little bit about what you heard [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  in Thursday's hearing on how abortion bans and restrictions affect real folks who are already [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=105.84s)]
*  the most vulnerable in our society. It was heartbreaking. And like you said, it affects [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=111.04s)]
*  our most vulnerable. We did a report that I thought was astonishing. Actions speak louder [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=117.2s)]
*  than words. They keep saying that they just want to return it to state rights. But we documented [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  51 bills, over 51 bills that banned abortions that have been introduced in this last Congress, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=129.52s)]
*  over 120 laws that have passed across this country restricting a woman's right to choose. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=137.28s)]
*  They're no longer restricting it. They're bulldozing our rights right into the ground, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=143.84s)]
*  and they're not stopping. They're talking about access to birth control. But over 51 laws that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  either outright ban abortion or get a crime, could put doctors and nurses in jail, banning access to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=155.76s)]
*  medicated abortions and banning the freedom to move across state lines to seek an abortion. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Democrats, on the other hand, we have passed a federally protected right to abortion in the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  House. It's stalled in the Senate. And we have also passed a bill that guarantees [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=178.72s)]
*  access to abortion. The Biden-Harris administration has come out with numerous [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=183.92s)]
*  executive orders to restrict and to help women access health care. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=188.96s)]
*  The Republicans were saying that abortion is not health care. That was their main theme. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=195.28s)]
*  But all of our doctors on the panel and the official doctors and gynecologists, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=200.4s)]
*  their organizations have come out and said that abortion is absolutely health care [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=206.24s)]
*  and that women will die, women will be injured and hurt in many cases because of their lack of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  access to an abortion. We heard heartbreaking stories of women that were forced to carry [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  children that were incompatible with life and really life-threatening situations that they were in. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  Congresswoman, allow me to shift gears and get your thoughts on another important development. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=231.28s)]
*  There was some breaking news that came out earlier tonight. I'm sure you're aware of the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=235.52s)]
*  National Archives telling your committee that it has still, till this day, not recovered all the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=238.96s)]
*  records from Trump administration officials that should have been transferred under the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=244.96s)]
*  Presidential Records Act. What is your reaction to that shocking news that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=249.68s)]
*  NARA does not have the records that they are supposed to have? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=255.44s)]
*  Well, it is shocking and it's outrageous that 20 months after our former president left office, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=259.2s)]
*  we still do not have the records that are required by law that belong to the American people, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=267.6s)]
*  that we don't have them. And they have shown total disregard to the law. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  And we're not going to stop until we get them. The archivist wrote me a letter. We got it last [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=278.08s)]
*  night saying that they do not have all of the records and we're not stopping until we [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=282.88s)]
*  retrieve them. And we're working on legislation to make sure that it never happens again. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=289.36s)]
*  What is very troubling to me, according to our investigation, there were a lot of folders [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=293.84s)]
*  marked highly classified and there was no documents in the folder. So we don't know [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=301.2s)]
*  what the classified information was or where it is or who has it. And that's a national security [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  risk. This is a very serious disrespect for the law and the number of national security marked [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=312.08s)]
*  documents was highly, highly troubling to say the least and dangerous, I would say. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=320.32s)]
*  And it's been kept in sites that are not, they're not secure. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, who knows where they are. In fact, Congressman Carolyn Maloney, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=332.08s)]
*  I appreciate your time as always. Thank you so much for joining us this evening. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUJ7ryHYlx4&t=342.08s)]
