# GOP confronted: 'Yes to Neo-Nazis, no to drag races' in Tennessee war on free speech
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58)
*  Tennessee, picking a battle that few Americans seem concerned with. Drag shows. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans are claiming a power, they say, to be able to ban drag shows in public spaces. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=5.84s)]
*  Historians say it's the first such law in this modern era, and legal experts say it may be unconstitutional, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=12.0s)]
*  because there is a very high bar for when the government's allowed to restrict gatherings or speech in public based on the content. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Now, like many free speech issues, keep in mind, this is not about whether you personally like seeing drag shows. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=27.28s)]
*  You can have your own opinion on that. Or puppet shows. Or country music performances in public. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=35.04s)]
*  This one is about whether the government decides that for you, and then censors speech. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=41.2s)]
*  Consider the current position of Tennessee's government. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=46.56s)]
*  Neo-Nazis and hate groups can gather in public, but drag performers cannot. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=50.64s)]
*  And this isn't hypothetical. We've seen these public marches and gatherings like that in many states recently. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=56.56s)]
*  And here's the thing about free speech and why this is our top story right now tonight. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=61.68s)]
*  The whole point is protecting it when you disagree, including even extreme or terrible ideas you disagree with, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=65.68s)]
*  as long as they don't turn into the direct advancement of violence or crimes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=74.0s)]
*  Now, banning certain public gatherings and speech, like banning books and censoring ideas, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=78.56s)]
*  is quite literally how authoritarian systems operate. That is the significant larger point. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  There's also the additional hate mongering and hypocrisy in waging this attack on what, again, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=89.92s)]
*  as of very recent times, most people would call the non-issue of public drag shows. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=95.84s)]
*  Republican Governor Bill Lee signed this into law despite exercising his free speech right [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=101.84s)]
*  to dress in drag back in school. That's his right, by the way. That's his 1977 yearbook. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=107.52s)]
*  And the right to speak and express yourself, which constitutionally, in this country legally, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=115.44s)]
*  still includes how you express yourself in appearance, if that is part of what you want to say, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=122.08s)]
*  what you want to express. And it's something long exercised from politics to culture. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=127.52s)]
*  Maybe you could tell me what you think of this thing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=132.24s)]
*  I like that. Dad? Yeah. Dad? Yeah, honey. They're so light and so fast, my grandma ma can whoop you in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=140.96s)]
*  a grandma ma. Let's go. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=152.0s)]
*  I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all. Why not? Well, in the first place, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=160.4s)]
*  I'm not a natural blonde. Doesn't matter. But you don't understand. I'm good. I'm a man. Well, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=166.8s)]
*  nobody's perfect. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=176.08s)]
*  Nobody's perfect. Now, the serious part is Republicans down there, they'd have you arrested [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  if you've performed, say, the play of Miss Doubtfire in Tennessee in public. Or if you [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=189.44s)]
*  were a politician like Giuliani or Governor Lee appearing a drag in public, you would be arrested [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=194.8s)]
*  if this law were enforced evenly. But most people don't seriously expect this law to be [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=199.28s)]
*  enforced evenly because this is not a serious rule enacted for the public interest. This is an attack [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=205.44s)]
*  on free speech, on freedom. And this is also a provocation, trying to show who's in charge [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=215.2s)]
*  and abuse police power to take sides. Now, that's against the spirit of democracy. It's also, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=224.88000000000002s)]
*  by the way, against the spirit of any actual definition of conservative philosophy on [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  government power. But these are not serious conservatives. So what happens at CPAC or inside [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  this hardened trolling bubble of MAGA politicking and content? Well, you see tonight, it doesn't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=245.52s)]
*  stay there. It spreads. It grows. And as many have warned before, this ain't original to me. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=252.8s)]
*  The efforts to pick on, ban, and marginalize small groups, the different, the other, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=263.68s)]
*  they tend to spread too. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo33leRIn58&t=273.12s)]
