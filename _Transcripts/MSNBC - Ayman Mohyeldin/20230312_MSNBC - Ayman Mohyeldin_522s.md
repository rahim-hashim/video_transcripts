Video Description: President Joe Biden formally unveiled his new budget proposal this week, and it aims to cut the federal deficit by nearly 3 trillion dollars over the next decade. It’s a tall order, but the White House says it can be accomplished through a combination of raising taxes on billionaires and oil companies, doing away with the carried-interest loophole, and curtailing pandemic-related spending. Meanwhile, the Republicans are still struggling to devise a counter proposal. Congressman Sean Casten joined former HUD Secretary Julián Castro to talk about about the schisms in the GOP caucus.

# Biden budget proposal catches House Republicans flat-footed
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI)
*  Spring is right around the corner and Joe Biden is breaking out his garden shears. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=0.0s)]
*  The president formally unveiled his new budget proposal this week aiming to cut the federal [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=10.8s)]
*  deficit by a projected $3 trillion over the next decade, in part through a new 25% tax [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=15.5s)]
*  on billionaires. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Other provisions of the plan, the corporate tax rate would increase from 21% to 28%. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=23.92s)]
*  There's an increase in capital gains taxes along with an end to the carried interest [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=29.72s)]
*  loophole, tax hikes for oil and gas companies and a curtailing of COVID related spending. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=34.36s)]
*  Now, to be clear, no one in the White House thinks the Republican controlled house will [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=41.64s)]
*  actually adopt President Biden's budget in its current form. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  There'll be plenty of wrangling and negotiation in the weeks to come. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  So why does it matter? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=56.56s)]
*  Well, the budget proposal is a sign of the president's priorities, who he wants to help [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=58.72s)]
*  and what he wants to accomplish with the rest of his term. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=62.92s)]
*  In effect, it's an opening pitch for his reelection bid and a challenge to House Republicans who [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  appear to have no plan of their own. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=72.4s)]
*  Speaker Kevin McCarthy has promised to balance the budget in the next decade. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=75.48s)]
*  But here's his problem. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=79.92s)]
*  He's also promised not to raise taxes and not to cut Social Security, Medicare or defense [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=81.6s)]
*  spending. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=87.52s)]
*  Effectively, there's little that he can do. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=88.52s)]
*  The math just doesn't add up. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=92.16s)]
*  So it seems Republicans are stuck between a rock and a hard place. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=95.08s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Sean Castan of Illinois. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  He's the co-chair of the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=104.0s)]
*  Congressman Castan, thank you for joining me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=109.16s)]
*  Now, as I mentioned, you're the co-chair of the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=111.12s)]
*  and you're a numbers guy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  So what do you make of Biden's budget proposal? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=118.28s)]
*  What are the priorities that he's signaling to voters with this budget proposal? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=121.56s)]
*  I think you characterized it very well, Lillian. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=128.64s)]
*  Thanks for having me here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=130.68s)]
*  It's a very responsible budget. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=132.2s)]
*  It addresses the things that everybody in Washington says we are very concerned about, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=133.6s)]
*  you know, the solvency of Medicare and Social Security, making sure that no one who is earning [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  less than $400,000 pays, you know, doesn't have this increase in their taxes, you know, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=142.84s)]
*  doubling down on what we're doing on climate change, cutting child poverty by extending [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=148.88s)]
*  the child tax credits. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=152.0s)]
*  None of us are under any illusions that the Republican leadership is going to bring this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=153.68s)]
*  up. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=158.4s)]
*  You know, I think as all of us who watched or were present on the floor for the swearing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=159.4s)]
*  of McCarthy know, he did not get his job because of his leadership skills, to put it mildly. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=162.72s)]
*  And so now we're sitting here trying to figure out, can the House Republican leadership even [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=169.56s)]
*  manage to avert a default on our debt, you know, and restore the debt ceiling, much less [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=174.12s)]
*  get a budget done. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=179.96s)]
*  I think we would all love to be surprised. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=180.96s)]
*  But seeing the, you know, seeing the, you know, essentially the ransom list from the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=182.92s)]
*  Freedom Caucus that came out, I guess, yesterday, it's not clear that McCarthy has the ability [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=187.48s)]
*  to steer his team through. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=195.76s)]
*  Now, he can do it with Democrats. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=197.16s)]
*  He can probably do it with some fulcrum of reasonable Republicans as well. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=198.56s)]
*  But I think expectations are pretty low that he's going to be able to do that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=203.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, obviously, we know this budget proposal is in effect a wish list, as you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=206.6s)]
*  acknowledged, others acknowledged, GOP lawmakers are never going to let it pass in its current [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=213.6s)]
*  form since they control the House. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=217.88s)]
*  Like, that's nothing new, right, with the dynamic that we have, the political dynamic. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=220.04s)]
*  Do Dems have the upper hand here? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=225.28s)]
*  How do you see this battle playing out over the coming weeks? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=228.56s)]
*  I mean, what's tragic is that we're going to view this through a political lens because, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=233.28s)]
*  you know, we're in a political job, I suppose. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=239.04s)]
*  But this budget is actually a lot like it's building on the successes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=242.48s)]
*  I mean, if we were not talking about this in a partisan sense, we'd be talking about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  the fact that, you know, we've seen record job growth. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=250.72s)]
*  We have seen for the first time in, what, 30, 40 years, finally some significant wage [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=254.72s)]
*  inflation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=262.32s)]
*  You know, for years, workers' wages didn't keep up with inflation, and now we're starting [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=263.32s)]
*  to close that gap. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=266.96s)]
*  We're creating jobs in this country faster than we're creating workers, and we have a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=268.64s)]
*  workplace shortage. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=271.96s)]
*  These are all good problems. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=273.12s)]
*  These are problems that we started to fix in the last term. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=274.12s)]
*  And yes, I suppose the Democrats look better than the Republicans in this moment because [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=277.68s)]
*  we're adults who are there to govern, not sitting there trying to, you know, spend our [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=283.24s)]
*  time on, you know, gotcha hearings saying that somehow, I don't know, you know, learning [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=287.56s)]
*  about our history is bad or allowing free markets to allocate capital is a bad thing, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=292.08s)]
*  which is essentially what this whole anti-ESG movement is. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=299.0s)]
*  And so, yes, I guess we look better because we're in the adults in the room. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=302.2s)]
*  But there are real people who have real needs that we should be focused on. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=306.32s)]
*  And it's, I think for all of us who care about this job and care about this country, it is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=310.2s)]
*  disappointing that the Republicans aren't taking it seriously. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=313.68s)]
*  You make a great point about the substance that behind these numbers, there are people's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=316.84s)]
*  lives and how they're affected. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=320.68s)]
*  And every time I hear the president talk about the child tax credit and that reducing child [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=322.92s)]
*  poverty in our country by half during the time that it was expanded, the meaningfulness [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=329.0s)]
*  of that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=334.64s)]
*  I do want to ask you about another political fight because it's going to be a consequential [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=336.12s)]
*  one. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=341.8s)]
*  We're wrapping up to a big debt ceiling battle. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=342.8s)]
*  Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times that this week that Republicans, quote, claim to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=345.8s)]
*  believe that rising federal debt is a major crisis. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  But if they really believe that, they'd be willing to accept at least some pain, accept [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=355.0s)]
*  some policies they dislike, take on popular spending programs in the name of deficit reduction. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  Do you see any of that happening? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  Look, what the Republicans know, but they don't like to admit is that 25 percent of all the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=373.48s)]
*  debt we have ever incurred as a country was born on Donald Trump's watch. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=377.48s)]
*  And I don't maybe I'm naive. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=383.72s)]
*  I don't think they want to blow up the economy, but they believe they have a hostage and folks [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=387.4s)]
*  are going to flinch if they take the hostage. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=391.23999999999995s)]
*  I sometimes regret that we get caught up in all this Washington speak. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=395.0s)]
*  You know, debt ceiling is not a term that people understand. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=398.28s)]
*  But for your viewers, imagine that you got a job, you got a salary, you went to college, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=401.4s)]
*  you took out some student debt, you bought a mortgage, and then you started calling up [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  your student loan servicer and your mortgage company and said, I've decided I'm not going [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=409.32s)]
*  to pay. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  What do you think would happen? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  That is essentially what the debt fight is. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=416.04s)]
*  We have we have chosen through various congresses to set taxes and income at certain levels, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=418.36s)]
*  to take on various expenses, to provide social services. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  And and by the way, if you haven't noticed, global markets kind of like investing in the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=427.0s)]
*  U.S. We are still a very effective place for countries around the world to put their money. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=431.88s)]
*  And we're able to do that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm not saying that we shouldn't be concerned about our debt. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  But to decide not to pay is to completely destroy the economy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=440.44s)]
*  I mean, you know, you ain't saying nothing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=446.96s)]
*  Silicon Valley Bank, that's a that's a fart in the whirlwind of what's coming if we start [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=449.08s)]
*  defaulting on our debt and raising interest rates and say mortgages go up. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=453.12s)]
*  And I don't I hope that calmer heads will prevail. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=457.04s)]
*  But you know, the freedom caucus demands, you know, one of the things they suggest is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=462.0s)]
*  their their conditions for getting this all done is they want to number one, defund the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=465.52s)]
*  police. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=470.08s)]
*  They call it the IRS. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=471.08s)]
*  But the IRS is a law enforcement agency. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=472.08s)]
*  They want to defund the IRS, which would cost us a ton of money because then rich people [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHq3n_fe7oI&t=473.52s)]
