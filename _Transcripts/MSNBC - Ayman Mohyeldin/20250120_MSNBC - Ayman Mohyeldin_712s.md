# How Biden’s Middle East policy tarnished his legacy
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8)
*  Joe Biden's been using his final days in office to promote his achievements and defend his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=0.0s)]
*  legacy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=5.3s)]
*  But while doing so, he made a stunning admission in an exclusive interview with Lawrence O'Donnell. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=6.3s)]
*  This is what he said when he was asked about the first time he used the word ceasefire [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=11.42s)]
*  with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=15.76s)]
*  When I went to Israel, immediately after their attack by Hamas, eight days later, whatever [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=19.84s)]
*  and I told him we were going to help. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  And I said, but Bibi, I said, you can't be carpet bombing these communities. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=32.56s)]
*  And he said to me, well, you did it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=38.8s)]
*  You carpet bomb, not his exact words, but you carpet bomb Berlin. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=42.48s)]
*  You dropped a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=47.12s)]
*  You killed thousands of innocent people because you had to in order to win a war. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  I said, but that's why we came up with the U.N. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=54.48s)]
*  New deals by which how what would we do relative civilians and military. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=59.44s)]
*  And just to be clear, Benjamin Netanyahu is now a man wanted for war crimes by the International [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=65.52s)]
*  Criminal Court. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=71.28s)]
*  That Biden statement may be one day used against him in a court of law. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=72.64s)]
*  But what does it say about Joe Biden? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=77.92s)]
*  He admitted that he knew what Netanyahu was planning to do to the Palestinian civilian [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=80.48s)]
*  population in Gaza all the way back in October of 2023. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=84.64s)]
*  And yet he still supported it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=88.72s)]
*  While it's revealing that Biden is openly admitting he knew what Netanyahu's intentions [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=90.64s)]
*  were, it really was not a mystery. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=95.2s)]
*  Israeli leaders were saying them out loud. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  The rhetoric was used as a basis for South Africa's genocide case against Israel in the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  International Court of Justice. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  And in January of last year, the ICJ found that Israel was plausibly committing genocide, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=107.2s)]
*  a finding Israel immediately dismissed. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=112.16s)]
*  But the dangerous rhetoric wasn't just happening in Israeli society. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  And just like after 9-11 and the lead up to the Iraq War, violent rhetoric and bigotry [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=118.16s)]
*  was also mixed with misinformation and disinformation right here in the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=122.4s)]
*  And just like the Iraq War, it came from both the media and the White House. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=132.08s)]
*  children. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  Of course, the White House had to immediately correct Joe Biden there and tell reporters [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  that he had actually not seen any evidence of this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=148.56s)]
*  But Biden repeated that same false claim again just a month later. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=152.4s)]
*  Another thing that's notable about Biden now, saying he first mentioned ceasefire to Netanyahu [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  in October of 23, is that it is the opposite of what he was telling the American people [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=161.76s)]
*  at the time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=167.92s)]
*  In fact, here's what the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  same month when she was asked what the president thought of Congresswomen's Rashida Tlaib, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=172.56s)]
*  Ilhan Omar and Cory Bush calling for a ceasefire. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  We believe they're wrong. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  We believe they're repugnant and we believe they're disgraceful. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  A month later, as the Palestinian death toll was rapidly climbing, Joe Biden was asked [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=185.84s)]
*  directly about the prospects for a ceasefire. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=193.04s)]
*  But then something changed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=202.0s)]
*  Polls began to show that most Americans, and especially in Biden's base, were against that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=204.24s)]
*  disastrous policy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=209.28s)]
*  Hundreds of black pastors warned Biden that he would cause Democrats the election by supporting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=210.88s)]
*  Israel's assault on Gaza. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=215.36s)]
*  Several members of the Biden administration resigned in protest, sharing their stories [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=217.12s)]
*  on this show and others. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  American college students and people all around the world started protesting, and in Michigan, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=223.68s)]
*  the uncommitted movement organized over 100,000 voters in that swing state to push Biden to stop [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=227.68s)]
*  Netanyahu and to save his presidency. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=234.0s)]
*  So without a clear explanation, the Biden administration changed their rhetoric, and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  they were now supposedly for a ceasefire. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=241.36s)]
*  Days before the Michigan primary, this was the president right here in New York eating [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=244.64s)]
*  an ice cream with Seth Meyers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  My national security advisor tells me that we're close. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=252.88s)]
*  We're close. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  We're not done yet. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  And my hope is by next Monday we'll have a ceasefire. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=257.52s)]
*  For the next several months, the Israeli press regularly published stories about how it was [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=261.84s)]
*  Netanyahu that was sabotaging the ceasefire and hostage release talks every time. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=266.32s)]
*  But here at home, Antony Blinken would constantly tell the American public that it was Hamas. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=271.52s)]
*  I regularly warned on this show that it wasn't deep fakes that would make Biden look weak [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=276.96s)]
*  and pathetic. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=282.32s)]
*  It was Netanyahu. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=283.28s)]
*  He would taunt Joe Biden with videos like this one complaining that US weapons weren't [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=284.64s)]
*  getting there in time, and the Biden administration would then send more. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  Biden told my colleague, Jonathan Capehart, that Israel invading the densely packed Palestinian [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  city of Rafah was his red line. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=298.08s)]
*  And months later, NBC News got inside and reported that Rafah had been turned into a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=300.96s)]
*  ghost town and now uninhabitable. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=306.96s)]
*  Palestinians and human rights groups warned that Israel was following through on their [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=309.52s)]
*  threats to stop humanitarian aid from getting into Gaza. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  And rather than forcing Israel to allow aid to get into Gaza, Biden announced that the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=316.64s)]
*  US military would build a floating pier on the Gaza coast. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=320.64s)]
*  But that pier quickly turned into an international embarrassment. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=324.96s)]
*  And due to bad weather, it only operated for 20 days before it was dismantled. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=328.8s)]
*  It barely got any aid in and still cost taxpayers $230 million. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=333.04s)]
*  And unfortunately, that's not all that we lost. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  On October 31, 23-year-old Sergeant Kawandre Stanley died from injuries he suffered while [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=340.8s)]
*  serving on that temporary Gaza pier mission. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=346.8s)]
*  And you've probably never even heard of his name. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=349.36s)]
*  Sergeant Stanley's death was only made public by the Department of Defense five days after [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=352.0s)]
*  it happened on Election Day, predictably buried in a chaotic news cycle. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=357.2s)]
*  At one point during a flare-up in the region, Biden declared, if you harm an American, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  we will respond. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  So who will have to answer for Sergeant Stanley's death? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=369.2s)]
*  What about Jacob Flickinger, a US citizen, a humanitarian aid worker killed by Israel [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=372.64s)]
*  in its strike on World Central Kitchen aid workers last April? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=377.2s)]
*  What about Aisha Noor-Aigi, a 26-year-old American citizen from Seattle, shot in the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=381.36s)]
*  head and killed by an Israeli soldier at a West Bank protest last September? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=385.68s)]
*  Time and time again, we were told that empathy was Joe Biden's superpower. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=390.48s)]
*  And time and time again, he showed none, not for the tens of thousands of Palestinians [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=394.32s)]
*  killed at the hands of Israel or even for those American citizens. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=399.12s)]
*  Aisha Noor-Aigi's family says that they still have not gotten a condolence phone call [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=403.68s)]
*  from the Biden administration. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=408.32s)]
*  We were also told that Biden and Harris were working tirelessly for a ceasefire. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=410.4s)]
*  But the Biden administration vetoed four Gaza ceasefire resolutions at the United [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=414.4s)]
*  Nations Security Council. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=418.88s)]
*  And now that a ceasefire has gone through reporting shows that it was President-elect's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=420.4s)]
*  Trump advisor, Steve Woodcock, that played a big role in pushing it through. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=424.96s)]
*  But it was one of Biden's own diplomats that shed some new light on the impact of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=429.76s)]
*  Biden's Middle East policy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=434.08s)]
*  Biden's ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, was quoted last week saying, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=440.32s)]
*  A new poll last week actually backed that up. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=452.32s)]
*  The survey from YouGov found that 29% of Americans who supported Biden in 2020 sat out [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=454.72s)]
*  the 2024 election specifically due to U.S. support for Israel's war on Gaza. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=460.64s)]
*  Keep in mind, Democrats lost the race due to a huge drop-off in voter turnout on their [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=466.24s)]
*  side. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=471.12s)]
*  While Joe Biden secured some major domestic achievements for this country, he will sadly [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=472.32s)]
*  be remembered for two things. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=477.12s)]
*  First, the mass killing and utter destruction of Gaza that was made with American weapons [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=479.44s)]
*  and diplomatic support. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  And second, handing the keys to the White House back to a MAGA movement that is now [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=486.0s)]
*  stronger and more dangerous than ever. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  A legacy of shame and infamy. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=495.76s)]
*  With me now to unpack all of this is MSNBC political analyst Peter Beinart. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=498.0s)]
*  He is the author of The Beinart Notebook on Substack and has an upcoming book called [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=501.6s)]
*  Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=505.04s)]
*  Peter, it's good to have you with us. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=508.32s)]
*  I want to ask you, and I made the case for how I see Joe Biden's legacy certainly in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=511.12s)]
*  foreign policy, but what do you see as Joe Biden's legacy when it comes to the Middle [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=514.88s)]
*  East and foreign policy? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=519.44s)]
*  I mean, the tragedy is that the centerpiece of Joe Biden's foreign policy and domestic [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=521.2s)]
*  policy was going to be the rule of law. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=527.0400000000001s)]
*  He was going to challenge not only the Donald Trumps of the world, but the Xi Jinping's [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  of the world and the Vladimir Putin's of the world around what they called the liberal [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  international order, the idea that you couldn't attack your neighbors, that all people had [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=538.48s)]
*  the right to equal rights and equal dignity. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  That was going to be the center, the moral centerpiece of his administration. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=545.52s)]
*  And his policies on Gaza pour the heart out of that because the world could see that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=550.0s)]
*  the U.S. was violating the very things that it claimed to believe in, the international [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=556.8s)]
*  rule of law, the idea that all human beings deserve protection, the idea that Palestinian [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=561.12s)]
*  lives are equal to Israeli lives. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=568.08s)]
*  All of those things were catastrophically damaged and have undermined America's ability [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=570.32s)]
*  to fight authoritarianism around the world and at home as well. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=575.6s)]
*  What did you make of Jack Lew's comments there and this idea that if Israel is now seen as [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=580.16s)]
*  a political liability for Democrats, that may force them to change policy in the future? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=584.32s)]
*  I'm not sure that's what he intended with those comments, but that's how I saw them, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=588.72s)]
*  that the president took this position of being staunchly supportive of Israel to the detriment [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=592.64s)]
*  of his own party and to the future of America. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=598.72s)]
*  I think there's going to be a huge fight inside the Democratic Party, and we'll see it in [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=602.88s)]
*  2028 in the Democratic primary. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=606.64s)]
*  There are going to be some politicians, I think, who see this huge gap between where [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=608.96s)]
*  Democratic voters are. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=613.44s)]
*  Democratic voters don't support unconditional support for Benjamin Netanyahu, and this is [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=614.96s)]
*  really government. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=619.2800000000001s)]
*  They profoundly oppose it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=620.0s)]
*  There's a big gap between Democratic voters and Democratic politicians. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=621.52s)]
*  There will be Democratic presidential candidates who try to speak to that, and I think there [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=624.88s)]
*  will be a titanic fight within the party over the future of policy with Israel and Palestine. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=630.32s)]
*  Earlier today, Joe Biden gave what are likely his final remarks in South Carolina. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=636.0s)]
*  He touched on the importance of history and said, quote, some injustices are so heinous [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=641.84s)]
*  that they can never be buried, no matter how hard people try. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=646.4000000000001s)]
*  If I were to use that same logic, how important will documenting the suffering of the Palestinians [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=651.2800000000001s)]
*  and the Israeli hostages be as both sides try to find some form of reconciliation after all this? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  This is going to be something that Americans and people around the world are talking about [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=663.04s)]
*  for generations. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=666.72s)]
*  If you just look at the number of children killed in Gaza, you compare it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=668.16s)]
*  This may go down as, so far, the greatest human rights catastrophe of the 21st century, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=672.24s)]
*  certainly per capita, and it's one that was actually facilitated by American weapons and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=678.16s)]
*  American diplomatic support. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=683.36s)]
*  That is going to haunt American foreign policy and Americans for generations. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=685.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2_qxGYsv8&t=692.88s)]
