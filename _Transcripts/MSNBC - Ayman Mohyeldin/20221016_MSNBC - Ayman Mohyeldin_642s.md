# Jan. 6 Committee Made Trump’s Culpability 'Dramatically Clear': Laurence Tribe
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w)
*  Let's discuss all of this and more with Lawrence Tribe, Professor Emeritus at Harvard Law School. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=0.0s)]
*  Professor Tribe, it's great to have you back again on the show. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  We've been checking in with you throughout these hearings whenever there is an inflection [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=9.56s)]
*  point of sorts. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=13.16s)]
*  And I wanted to get your reaction to Thursday's hearing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=14.16s)]
*  It certainly concluded with a bang. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=17.04s)]
*  Do you believe the committee accomplished what it needed to do? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=18.72s)]
*  I think the committee did a spectacular job of informing both itself and the American [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=23.52s)]
*  people of a grave ongoing danger to the survival of democracy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=31.0s)]
*  This final hearing made even clearer than the earlier ones did. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=38.8s)]
*  Day by day, detail by detail, how the former president of the United States engaged in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=44.96s)]
*  a premeditated plot to seize the election regardless of the outcome. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=53.08s)]
*  He made clear and his acolytes, people like Roger Stone and Steve Bannon made clear and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=61.92s)]
*  the committee enabled the American people to hear how they made clear that they were [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=68.92s)]
*  planning and plotting. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=74.36s)]
*  But no matter what the votes were, the president, because he knew that the way votes come in, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=76.36s)]
*  he would look like he was doing well on election evening, would proclaim himself the winner. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=82.56s)]
*  And then when the future votes came in, the ones that had been cast on time but hadn't [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=88.88s)]
*  been counted yet, he would say it was all phony. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=95.0s)]
*  That was the plan. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=98.08s)]
*  It was a plan that under the federal statutes is a seditious conspiracy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=99.56s)]
*  And the committee made it clear that one man was at the center of it, his own personal [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=106.12s)]
*  responsibility was made very dramatically clear. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=111.04s)]
*  And so he clearly has to be indicted whether he will be indicted first for his dangerous [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=115.04s)]
*  theft of top secret materials that he planned to use for who knows what in Mar-a-Lago or [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=122.56s)]
*  indicted first for obstruction of justice as he is continuing to hide materials or indicted [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=131.04s)]
*  first for his role in the attempted coup and in the violent insurrection that we've just [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=137.48s)]
*  seen in great detail. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=145.16s)]
*  That's not clear. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=147.16s)]
*  But what is clear is that he must be indicted. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=148.16s)]
*  Let me ask you about the subpoena here that was issued to the former president for a moment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=151.88s)]
*  And we should note, you know, it's not without precedent. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=157.76s)]
*  You had three other presidents, presidents Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson, excuse [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=159.92s)]
*  me, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=165.04s)]
*  They've all been subpoenaed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=166.68s)]
*  In your opinion and from your expertise, A, what is the likelihood that Donald Trump will [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=168.52s)]
*  testify but more specifically, what legal recourse of action or legal course of action [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  does the committee have if he refuses to do so? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, the committee can do two different things. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  It can hold him in contempt or it can go to court. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  Actually, there is a third and very obvious thing because those first two take time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=189.12s)]
*  Most obvious thing is that it can draw the natural conclusion from his attempt to avoid [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  testifying. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=202.2s)]
*  That conclusion is that he's got something to hide and we know what he has to hide. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=203.84s)]
*  And that is that he was at the center of a plot to overturn a free and fair election. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=208.7s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that even though you cannot use someone's refusal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=216.64s)]
*  to testify against him in a criminal trial so that when Donald Trump is tried for various [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=222.72s)]
*  crimes, his refusal to testify can't be used against him, it can and should be used to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  draw the logical inference that he is trying to hide his guilt. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  That's why he doesn't want to come. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  It's not because he's got bone spurts. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=245.32s)]
*  It's not because he has forgotten too much. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=248.08s)]
*  It's because he knows that if he is not going to perjure himself, he's going to have to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=254.12s)]
*  convict himself. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  He's basically going to have to admit what we now know and that is that he plotted to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  stay in power no matter what. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=267.44s)]
*  Basically, to say to the voters, I don't care what you say, I'm the boss. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=269.92s)]
*  And the committee will draw the inference from his silence, adding all of that to the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=277.04s)]
*  mountain of evidence that has accumulated, will draw the inference that he was at the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=283.08s)]
*  center of a plot to overturn the election, to commit serious insurrection against the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  United States government. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  There's speculation that Trump, if he were to testify, he'd prefer to do it publicly. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=296.52s)]
*  Would public testimony be beneficial to the committee or is there fear that someone like [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=301.04s)]
*  Donald Trump could turn the process into a spectacle? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=305.92s)]
*  Well, he will try. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  If he really meant that he wanted to testify publicly, I would take him up on his challenge. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=311.72s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=319.8s)]
*  You say you want to testify publicly. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=320.8s)]
*  He's always said that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  He said he wanted to testify before Robert Mueller. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=323.64s)]
*  But when push comes to shove, he's a coward. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  So he won't do it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=328.76s)]
*  But I think the committee should call his bluff. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=329.76s)]
*  And if he testifies, he's going to lie. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=332.36s)]
*  That's all he knows how to do. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  And he'll lie under oath and commit perjury, adding to his crimes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=335.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm with you on that one. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=340.2s)]
*  I was going to say, I'm with you on that one. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  I think he's definitely afraid to appear in front of the public and field those questions [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=344.76s)]
*  and have to think live in the moment without, as you said, perjuring himself. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=349.44s)]
*  Let me ask you, Professor Tribe, a big part of this focus, and you brought this up as [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=354.88s)]
*  well, a big part of the hearing focused on the idea of premeditation. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  The panel presented multiple pieces of compelling evidence that showed Trump planned to refuse [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=363.24s)]
*  to cede power regardless of the election results, some of it based on close confidants months [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=370.0s)]
*  in advance. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=375.32s)]
*  Let me just play for you one example of this watch. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=376.32s)]
*  A few days before the election, Mr. Trump also consulted with one of his outside advisors, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  Inside Activist Tom Fitton, about the strategy for election night. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=388.32s)]
*  The select committee got this pre-prepared statement from the National Archives. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=394.0s)]
*  As you can see, the draft statement, which was sent on October 31st, declares, we had [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  an election today and I won. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=407.14s)]
*  And the Fitton memo specifically indicates a plan that only the votes counted by the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=410.92s)]
*  election day deadline, and there is no election day deadline, would matter. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=416.64s)]
*  Explain to us the significance of this kind of evidence when it comes to building a possible [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=422.92s)]
*  criminal case against the former president. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=428.16s)]
*  Well the criminal case will charge that the president conspired with Fitton and with Bannon [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=432.08s)]
*  and with Stone and with others, including his own chief of staff, to steal the election [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  regardless of the outcome. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=447.88000000000005s)]
*  If he doesn't win, he's going to claim that he won. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  That is a crime. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a crime from many different angles. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=455.72s)]
*  And part of a crime is that you have the requisite mental state, that you're not just stumbling [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  into it, you know what you're doing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=464.72s)]
*  In the absence of this kind of evidence, he might have been able to say, well I really [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=467.88s)]
*  thought I won. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=472.94s)]
*  I was delusional. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=474.12s)]
*  It's kind of a vague version of an insanity defense. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=475.12s)]
*  It wouldn't have been very effective anyway, but now it's completely off the table. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=479.76s)]
*  There's no way he can say that he really thought he won. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=484.24s)]
*  We now have testimony that he planned, regardless of the outcome, to claim that he won. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=488.14s)]
*  We have testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson that she heard him saying to Meadows that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=494.2s)]
*  he was embarrassed about his loss. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=500.76s)]
*  He didn't want to admit it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  He was embarrassed about the nine to nothing decision of the U.S. Supreme Court turning [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  back his last Hail Mary pass in an attempt to have the court intervene in the election. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=509.32s)]
*  He didn't want people to learn about it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=515.16s)]
*  Well that's all proof that he wasn't just inadvertently doing something. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  He was deliberately violating the laws of the United States, deliberately trashing the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=524.84s)]
*  Constitution, making it clear that he's anything but repentant that he will do it again if [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=530.6s)]
*  we give him the chance. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=536.96s)]
*  So he certainly should be indicted, should be convicted, and quite apart from that, voters [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=538.96s)]
*  should take it into their own hands, both in the polling booth and by bringing the kinds [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawAR7jtH1w&t=545.48s)]
