# Trump's Coachella visit is a desperate 'Hail Mary' strategy attempt to pull in unlikely voters
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U)
*  So tonight, with just 23 days to go before the election, Donald Trump is taking Coachella. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=0.0s)]
*  Yep, you heard that correctly. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Coachella, as in the California desert, which we all associate with one of the world's most [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=7.4s)]
*  famous music festivals. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=12.18s)]
*  That time of year, when we get to two weekends of celebrity sightings and wild outfits, well, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=14.0s)]
*  in just one hour from now, Trump is headlining, not as a musical act, but as a presidential [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=19.76s)]
*  candidate at a ranch in the Coachella Valley. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=24.7s)]
*  If you take away the Coachella of it all, Trump is choosing to visit California, a state [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=27.6s)]
*  that leans heavily Democrat. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=32.36s)]
*  It's basically gone blue in every presidential election since 1988. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=34.68s)]
*  In fact, Trump lost California badly by more than 29 percentage points four years ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=39.0s)]
*  So why, of all places, is Trump holding a high-profile event there, weeks before the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  election, in a place that he has virtually no shot at winning? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=51.52s)]
*  Well, it turns out that this is not a one-off. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=55.92s)]
*  Trump is campaigning in several solidly Democratic states in the final weeks before the election. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  There's a strategy here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump campaigned in Aurora, Colorado, a Democratic state which hasn't been considered [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=65.12s)]
*  a battleground in several election cycles. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=70.28s)]
*  And now his team has booked Madison Square Garden, of all places, in New York City. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump is planning a rally there later this month. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=77.2s)]
*  So how does the Trump campaign explain this whole unorthodox approach? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, a senior Trump campaign advisor told NBC News they are thinking less local and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=84.72s)]
*  more national. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=89.92s)]
*  The national media's attention on these large-scale, outside-the-norm settings increases the reach [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=91.44s)]
*  of his message across the country and penetrates in every battleground state. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=96.4s)]
*  In other words, these rally locations are designed to get him as much coverage as possible [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=101.64s)]
*  and solidify his place as the media president. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  But this strategy isn't just about generating buzz. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=109.52s)]
*  He's also trying to boost performance in down-ballot races. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=112.08s)]
*  In California, Trump did get over 6 million votes in 2020, more than any other Republican [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=115.36s)]
*  presidential candidate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=119.6s)]
*  In some rural counties in California that tend to favor conservatives, his margins topped [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=121.08s)]
*  70 percent. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  By rallying those supporters, some of whom started gathering hours ahead of today's event, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=128.2s)]
*  he's trying to get conservatives to volunteer to help in down-ballot races in contested [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=133.12s)]
*  states and help draw out non-traditional voters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=137.04s)]
*  On the topic of that, it's about optics. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=142.0s)]
*  This is a clear attempt to bash Vice President Kamala Harris on her record, on camera, in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=145.24s)]
*  her own home state. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=149.36s)]
*  Head of the rally, campaign spokesperson Stephen Chung said in a statement, Kamala Harris did [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  unthinkable damage to California during her six years as the most liberal attorney general [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=154.9s)]
*  in state history. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump's trip to California will highlight Harris' failing record and show that he has [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=161.32s)]
*  the right solutions to save every state and every American. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, something Trump's advisers will not tell you, because we're talking about Donald Trump, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=169.16s)]
*  of course, and it always comes down to money or the lack of it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  California has loads of wealthy donors providing abundant opportunities for fundraising. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=178.24s)]
*  The Associated Press reports that at tonight's Coachella rally, photos with Trump are priced [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=183.08s)]
*  at $25,000. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  A single VIP experience will cost you $5,000. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  Now this might be a much-needed cash flow because lately Trump's richest donors, well, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=192.88s)]
*  they're not cutting it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=198.08s)]
*  According to reporting by the New York Times, Trump gathered some of the wealthiest figures [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=199.08s)]
*  at the Republican or in the Republican Party at Trump Tower last month, including billionaire [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=202.44000000000003s)]
*  Paul Singer and Betsy DeVos, and he lashed out at them over a dinner of steak and baked [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=207.84s)]
*  potatoes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump is also struggling with small dollar donations this time around. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=214.4s)]
*  An analysis by the Associated Press and Open Secrets found those contributions have plummeted [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  since his last drawn for the White House. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=223.56s)]
*  So weeks before the election, when Donald Trump is locked in a neck-and-neck race with [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=225.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris, when every movement counts, his campaign is just throwing things at the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=229.44s)]
*  wall to see what sticks. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=235.0s)]
*  There's no strategy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=236.68s)]
*  There's no strategic thinking or critical thinking about this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  The question remains, though, will a Hail Mary in blue states backfire or actually pay [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  off for Donald Trump? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=245.72000000000003s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this, David Jolly, MSNBC political analyst and former Republican [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  Congressman from Florida, Brian Tyler Cohen, MSNBC contributor and host of No Lie with [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=251.76s)]
*  Brian Tyler Cohen and author of the book Shameless, Republicans' Deliberate Dysfunction and the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=256.4s)]
*  Battle to Preserve Democracy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=261.08s)]
*  It's good to have both of you with us. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=262.68s)]
*  Brian, I'll start with you and your reaction to what we're about to see, Donald Trump [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=264.08s)]
*  going to this rally in Coachella in deep blue California and then, as we mentioned, Aurora, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=268.56s)]
*  Colorado, and then Madison Square Garden here in New York. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=273.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's one of two things. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=276.32s)]
*  And I want to caution not to try and sanewash what Donald Trump is doing in the sense that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=279.36s)]
*  a lot of people are saying that he might be heading over there to help these down ballot [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=283.68s)]
*  candidates. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=287.76s)]
*  Donald Trump does not do anything unless it benefits one person, and that is Donald Trump. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=288.76s)]
*  He's not doing this out of benevolence or out of graciousness. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=292.88s)]
*  That's not how he operates. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=297.84s)]
*  So, more likely is the point that, A, there is a lot of money out there, and so he'll [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=298.84s)]
*  do anything if it means he can consolidate more money for himself. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  Look, this guy is deluded enough and surrounded with enough sycophants and yes-men that when [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=307.32s)]
*  he says he wants to make a play for New York, I think that somewhere in his adult brain, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  he thinks that he's going to actually make a play for New York. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  And so he'll host these rallies in Madison Square Garden because this is, you know, if [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=321.56s)]
*  you needed a testament to the judgment of someone like Donald Trump, it is what he's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  doing right here where, in these last few weeks before the election, rather than make [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  the smart play, the objective smart play, and look, this is coming for somebody who [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=333.0s)]
*  voted for Hillary Clinton back in 2016, where we would have loved to see her campaign in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=336.04s)]
*  Wisconsin. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=340.8s)]
*  Instead of doing that, him go, let's, like, this idea that him going to New York and California [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=341.8s)]
*  is somehow some brilliant move is just completely backwards. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=346.76s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=349.76s)]
*  David, you're a Republican strategist. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=350.76s)]
*  I should say you have experience working with Republican strategists, so tell us what you [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=352.48s)]
*  make of this strategy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=356.0s)]
*  I mean, this idea that, you know, the Trump campaign, campaigning in Los Angeles or in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=357.0s)]
*  Coachella, you know, just give me your thoughts on it overall and whether you think this is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=363.56s)]
*  a good strategy for him. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  He says he wants to be there. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=369.32s)]
*  This strategist in that report suggests that he's there to talk about the border issue [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=370.48s)]
*  and try to put that front and center. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=375.32s)]
*  Yeah, and look, I do have 20 years of running campaigns before serving. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=377.96s)]
*  And so I think to Brian's point, part of this could just be raw vanity of Donald Trump, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=381.52s)]
*  someone who is deluded enough to think he's competitive in these states. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=386.72s)]
*  And the other is he's a historically bad candidate. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=390.32s)]
*  I mean, he truly is. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=392.76000000000005s)]
*  If you look at the objective numbers, any Republican but Trump would probably be faring [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=393.6s)]
*  a little better right now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=398.92s)]
*  Donald Trump just makes all the wrong moves. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  But there is something in the strategist's comments that I actually subscribe to. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  And I believe we are now in cycles, campaign cycles where all politics are national. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=405.16s)]
*  And if you consider in every community across the country for Republicans, what is informing [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=411.16s)]
*  their intensity, what is informing their vote? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=416.72s)]
*  It's the misinformation about Springfield, Ohio. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=419.0s)]
*  It's the misinformation about FEMA. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=421.32s)]
*  It's the misinformation about the Biden crime network or Vice President Harris. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=423.4s)]
*  And it doesn't matter where that bully pulpit is for Republicans. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=427.52s)]
*  That's the message that will resonate and quickly hit voters in whatever state in which [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  they live. I just find it fascinating that the Trump campaign has decided we can use a [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=435.64s)]
*  bully pulpit in California or in New York instead of, as Brian said, instead of in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=440.4s)]
*  Wisconsin, because if all politics is national, you could get the twofer of delivering the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=444.4s)]
*  same speech in Wisconsin that you're doing in California or New York. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=448.84s)]
*  I think there's a lot to unpack after this election about how we reach voters. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=452.35999999999996s)]
*  There are down ballot campaigns, Eamonn, struggling to reach voters with the traditional [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=456.88s)]
*  means of mail or digital or commercials. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  And so what you're seeing from the Trump campaign, I think, is a resignation to this [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=464.76s)]
*  notion that it doesn't matter where in the country they are, they're going to reach their [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=467.96s)]
*  Republican voters exactly the same, regardless of where the message is delivered from. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=471.64s)]
*  Brian, Republican. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  So go ahead, Brian. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=477.44s)]
*  I was going to say, can I jump in for a quick sec? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  Because just on that exact point, I do think there's something to be said for, you know, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=480.0s)]
*  this is this is kind of a microcosm of Trump's campaign more broadly, because he largely [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=484.88s)]
*  has, to David's point, given up on local politics. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=489.12s)]
*  We're seeing in a lot of these swing states, he's not opening up field offices. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=492.08s)]
*  He doesn't have campaign staff. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=495.64s)]
*  He's kind of sacrificed what we've known to be the effective means of actually reaching [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=497.36s)]
*  voters in these states in deference to these national political moves. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=502.52s)]
*  Like getting a rally out in Madison Square Garden in New York or going out to Coachella [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=507.32s)]
*  in California or just going on Fox and Friends, for example. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=511.92s)]
*  I don't think that that's the right move heading into November. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=514.96s)]
*  Obviously, we're going to have a better sense of that. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=517.72s)]
*  But it does show that Donald Trump is largely surrendering what we view as the ways to win [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=519.24s)]
*  these campaigns in these in these swing states. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=524.4s)]
*  So it's a good point about his unconventional approach. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=527.12s)]
*  And it kind of begs the question, David, about this reporting to suggest that he is [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=530.4s)]
*  growing frustrating with his rich donors. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=535.68s)]
*  I mean, a lot of money has been poured into Donald Trump over the years. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=537.5999999999999s)]
*  People who backed him and paid for his legal defenses, various charges that came his way [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=541.88s)]
*  and lawyers and all that, selling Bibles, selling shoes, selling whatever. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=548.4799999999999s)]
*  He's tried to he's tried to find a penny in every corner of this earth. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=552.88s)]
*  What is your reaction to that reporting on Trump's grievances about his wealthy supporters? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=556.64s)]
*  And how much do you think these high profile appearances ultimately boil down to concerns [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=560.5999999999999s)]
*  about campaign finances? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=564.56s)]
*  Donald Trump is a selfish grifter who's OK with criminality. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  And I would say to his wealthy donors, too bad you made your bed. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=569.92s)]
*  What did you think was going to happen when you started a relationship with Donald Trump? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=573.3599999999999s)]
*  He's one of the most ungrateful politicians you'll ever work for. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  And so I would consider first, what are you giving your money to? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=580.2399999999999s)]
*  You're giving your money to somebody who led an interaction on January 6th of twenty [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  twenty one and did not participate in a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=586.76s)]
*  And now, if you're surprised that he's also going to take your money while you're [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=590.0s)]
*  supporting him, too bad you earned it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=592.96s)]
*  You made you made your bed. Stick with it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=595.08s)]
*  And it seems, Brian, and correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=597.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, if it's attention that Trump wants, if media attention is what he really wants, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=598.96s)]
*  he passed up on a chance to debate the vice president again, which would have been a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=604.2800000000001s)]
*  national audience. He passed up that 60 minutes interview, you know, that he was [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  supposed to sit for on Monday. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=612.52s)]
*  And instead, he seems to be siloing himself just to his core base. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=614.72s)]
*  I mean, he's not getting national attention at these rallies. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  We're certainly not covering Coachella. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=621.08s)]
*  I don't know anyone else who will be covering his Coachella rally. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=622.52s)]
*  So at the end of the day, it's really more about just trying to juice up or jack out, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  jack up his base. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=629.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he wants the attention for sure, but he doesn't want that attention if [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=631.56s)]
*  it's going to come at the risk of him having to face off head to head with Kamala Harris [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=634.72s)]
*  or him having to face off with Leslie Stahl or some other legitimate reporter over at [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=639.0s)]
*  60 minutes. So he wants the attention, but he doesn't want it with with the pesky [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=643.88s)]
*  inconvenience of having that attention where he might also be fact checked, because God [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=648.64s)]
*  forbid, as we know now, Republicans face any prospect of a fact check. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=653.16s)]
*  So I think he's trying to have it both ways. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=657.72s)]
*  But but yeah, I mean, to that exact point, he has relinquished a lot of these opportunities [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  in the homestretch where he would actually get a lot of attention and instead is again, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=664.0400000000001s)]
*  siloing himself, which is not going to help him in these last, what is it, 30 some odd [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=668.24s)]
*  days where he should be not focused on just entrenching his support among the people who [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=674.32s)]
*  are already voting for him, but rather expanding his tent. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=679.4s)]
*  And I don't think he's going to do that by just solely focusing again on on his rallies [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=682.6800000000001s)]
*  with his most diehard supporters or interviews with Fox and Friends. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjjx7AAD11U&t=687.76s)]
