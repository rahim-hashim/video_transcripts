# 'The grift continues': Trump launches a sneaker line
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc)
*  Donald Trump at a sneaker convention today, announcing his, wait for it, you see it there [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=0.0s)]
*  on your screen, a new line of Trump sneakers for the low price of $399. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=5.86s)]
*  He's going to pay $450 million. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=12.08s)]
*  How many freaking sneakers does he have to sell to pay $400.5 billion? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=15.0s)]
*  I'm not going to amount, but how many sneakers? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=19.76s)]
*  I've got to see him on the New York subway selling this stuff. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Help me out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=23.32s)]
*  I need to raise $450 million, buy my sneakers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=24.32s)]
*  He got booed a lot, by the way. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=26.88s)]
*  He got cheered, but he got booed a lot at that event, and I really brought me joy to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=27.96s)]
*  see that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=31.52s)]
*  The grift continues with this guy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=32.52s)]
*  I don't know that the $399 sneakers make, I don't know that that's his audience. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=34.32s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, you're totally right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=40.84s)]
*  That's actually, joking aside, when you think about the young kids in this country who are [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=44.16s)]
*  sneaker heads and people who really go to these conventions, and it is a very lucrative [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=48.88s)]
*  trade. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=54.68s)]
*  I'm not going to pretend that I'm cool or know anything about sneakers, but I would [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=56.64s)]
*  say that it is not his base. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=59.84s)]
*  That is not the people in Philadelphia who are going to sneaker con are not the ones [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=62.26s)]
*  that are probably going to buy $400 sneakers from Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=66.56s)]
*  I've got my air amens on tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=68.64s)]
*  Bro, somebody sold you a fake pair of sneakers. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=71.48s)]
*  He's above it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=76.64s)]
*  Air amens, get him on eBay right now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=77.64s)]
*  You bought a fake pair of shoes that somebody said were air amens that have nothing to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=78.64s)]
*  do with it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  I will say this though, it's quite remarkable that this guy will find any product to hawk [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=83.2s)]
*  to anybody just to try to raise some money, and it looks like it's just going to keep [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  getting worse for him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  And they're going to try to take over the RNC, which is just, you know, I mean, there's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=92.64s)]
*  just so much money that he has to raise to pay for these judgments. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  Out of the three of us, you probably have a little bit more style sense, certainly more [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  than Dean, but what do you think of the shoe, that gold shoe with the American flag? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Also, why are we putting the American flag on sneakers? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=111.04s)]
*  What? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=113.56s)]
*  I am with that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=114.56s)]
*  You know, yet again you have rendered me speechless. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't know, I mean, I don't know who this is for. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't know why this is happening. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  Also, how do we think that there may be a challenge to the shoes with the red bottom [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=124.04s)]
*  soles? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=128.12s)]
*  Oh, labotans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=129.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=130.12s)]
*  The Trump Air, like his Trump Airlines, which crashed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=131.12s)]
*  So you have the Trump Airs, is that what they're going to call it? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=134.36s)]
*  Will someone buy it? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=137.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=138.56s)]
*  People send him money. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=140.08s)]
*  By the way, I hope he takes over the RNC, takes every penny from them so they can't [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=141.08s)]
*  help any Republican candidate across the nation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=144.12s)]
*  How good is this? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=146.5s)]
*  He will destroy this version of the GOP that we can't, he'll do it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=147.5s)]
*  Thank you, Donald Trump. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=150.84s)]
*  And you know, he might end up causing them their status. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=151.84s)]
*  Yeah, losing their status as a nonprofit. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=154.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_kksRgCRc&t=157.68s)]
