Video Description: How the late Pope reacted to the aftermath of October 7th was different from the coldness coming from many world leaders and politicians. He called for a ceasefire very quickly. He spoke out about the atrocities and alleged war crimes in Gaza and showed a kindness towards Palestinians that was rare for such a global figure. MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin walks through how Pope Francis kept Gaza at the forefront of his mind right until his final days.

# Pope Francis’ Legacy of Compassion for Palestinians
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ)
*  The images coming out of Gaza are still unbearable and the world is still looking away. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  What I am about to describe for you is too graphic to show on most TV screens in America. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=7.88s)]
*  One of the hundreds of children killed this week was this little girl where you see a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  blur on this roof. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=20.0s)]
*  That is in fact half of her body. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=21.56s)]
*  The second blur is the other half of her body. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=25.36s)]
*  An Israeli strike tore her small body apart. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=28.8s)]
*  And this is her brother Ali. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=32.08s)]
*  He barely survived. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  The blast threw him onto a neighbor's roof and from there he was able to wave for help [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=36.08s)]
*  and point it to the building where rescuers found what was left of his sister. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=41.8s)]
*  This is just one story. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  There are far, far more photos than anyone wants to admit. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=49.14s)]
*  Too many of them showing children wrapped in white cloth or torn apart by Israeli bombs. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=52.88s)]
*  And still in much of the Western media these stories don't lead the news and sometimes [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=60.28s)]
*  they are not even mentioned at all. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=65.64s)]
*  The violence has become routine. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=68.28s)]
*  The horror has become expected. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=71.04s)]
*  But this morning we witnessed the burial of someone who didn't accept atrocities like [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  these as the norm. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=79.08s)]
*  Someone who was loved by millions, who refused to go along with the silence and the indifference, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=81.08s)]
*  Pope Francis. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=87.0s)]
*  He died at age 88 years old, just one day after Easter. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=88.32s)]
*  He was the first pope from Latin America and he brought with him a warmth and empathy that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=91.92s)]
*  felt refreshing for many around the world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=96.6s)]
*  For the last decade the Vatican has generally had a more positive relationship with the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=99.0s)]
*  Global South and with Palestinians. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=104.48s)]
*  And how we saw this pope react to the aftermath of October 7th was different from the coldness [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=107.4s)]
*  that we have seen from many world leaders and politicians. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=113.12s)]
*  His response felt human. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Before the first month of the war had even passed he had called for a ceasefire saying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  simply war is always a defeat. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=122.76s)]
*  And by then entire families had been buried under the rubble and still the Biden administration [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  hadn't called for a ceasefire. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=131.32s)]
*  They could barely say the word. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=133.32s)]
*  He met with Palestinian families who have relatives in Gaza, the Vatican, whenever he [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=135.38s)]
*  could. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=139.06s)]
*  He also called for the release of the Israeli hostages and met with their families as well, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=140.06s)]
*  showing them more care and compassion than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  ever has. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=148.7s)]
*  People who sat with him said they could feel his sincerity. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  He made them feel seen. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=152.88s)]
*  He also did something very rare. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=156.1s)]
*  He turned attention to Palestinian Christians. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=157.54s)]
*  They're often left out of this entire conversation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=160.26s)]
*  They suffer under the same Israeli occupation, the same bombs, the same walls as other Palestinians. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=163.68s)]
*  Before the war there were just over a thousand Christians left in Gaza. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  Now only a few hundred remain. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=173.68s)]
*  Many have been killed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=175.68s)]
*  Three of Gaza's four churches have been bombed and are no longer safe. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=176.68s)]
*  The one still fully standing and the only Catholic church in Gaza, Holy Family Parish, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=180.84s)]
*  stayed on the pope's mind until the end of his life. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=186.48s)]
*  Starting in the late 2023, he called the priest and his assistant almost every night [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  just to check in, just to let them know that they weren't alone. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=195.44s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  It was more than just phone calls. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=220.56s)]
*  On the one year anniversary of the war, he wrote a letter to Catholics in the Middle [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=233.04s)]
*  East. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=236.56s)]
*  In it he said, I am with you, the people of Gaza, long embattled and in dire straits. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=237.56s)]
*  You are in my thoughts and prayers daily. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=242.38s)]
*  I am with you, who have been forced to leave your homes, to abandon schooling and work [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=244.36s)]
*  and to find a place of refuge from the bombing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  I am with you, who thirst for peace and justice and refuse to yield to the logic of evil. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=250.94s)]
*  In his final book he even called for an investigation into what might be considered a genocide in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=262.38s)]
*  Multiple human rights groups have already said it is. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=263.38s)]
*  And then this past December as he prayed in front of the nativity scene at the Vatican, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=266.22s)]
*  people noticed something special. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=270.4s)]
*  Baby Jesus was laid on a keffiyeh, a traditional Palestinian scarf also worn across the entire [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=272.22s)]
*  Arab world. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=278.38s)]
*  It symbolizes resilience, history, identity and much more. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=279.58s)]
*  Even though it clearly had his blessing, wearing the keffiyeh can make you a target right here [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=283.82s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=288.42s)]
*  And by some, it's been falsely labeled as an anti-Semitic symbol. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=290.3s)]
*  Israeli officials condemned Pope Francis again and again and again for his words and actions, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=294.3s)]
*  but he never backed down. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  If anything, he grew more direct. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  He used words like cruelty, illegal and immoral to describe Israel's war on Gaza. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=302.22s)]
*  He was sick in his final days, but he didn't go quietly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=307.46s)]
*  He had an archbishop deliver his Easter message which called for a permanent ceasefire, the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=310.02s)]
*  release of all Israeli hostages and full access to aid for Palestinians. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=314.58s)]
*  And after his death, social media lit up with moments of his quiet, unwavering solidarity [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  that public mourning clearly bothered some Israeli officials. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=323.7s)]
*  Because just hours after he passed, Israel's foreign ministry posted a short message of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  condolences on X, but then quietly deleted it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=331.41999999999996s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=336.02s)]
*  Trump and several world leaders showed up to his funeral. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=337.3s)]
*  Israel didn't send a single senior official. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=340.3s)]
*  That alone says something. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=342.06s)]
*  It shows just how threatening compassion can be. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=343.14s)]
*  You'd think his passing might give world leaders pause, make them reflect. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=346.3s)]
*  If this is how one of the most powerful religious figures in the world saw Gaza, maybe something [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=350.66s)]
*  needs to change. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=355.98s)]
*  But clearly his message didn't stick with people like JD Vance, who is Catholic himself. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=357.66s)]
*  This pope moved people across all faiths. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=362.3s)]
*  In a divided world, he modeled empathy and moral clarity. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=364.48s)]
*  Let's hope his passing teaches a final lesson in how to lead with dignity instead of looking [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=368.64000000000004s)]
*  the other way. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2eexCSayLQ&t=373.64000000000004s)]
