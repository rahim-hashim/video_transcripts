Video Description: Police in Albuquerque, New Mexico arrested Solomon Pena, a former Republican candidate for state office, in connection with a string of recent shootings.

MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin spoke to New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver about the rise of political violence and what needs to be done to protect elected officials.

# NM Secretary of State on the rise of political violence
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM)
*  Words have consequences. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=0.0s)]
*  It is a lesson most of us learn in kindergarten, but it appears that some members of the Republican [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=4.12s)]
*  Party never did. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=9.36s)]
*  This week, police in Albuquerque, New Mexico arrested Solomon Peña, a former Republican [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=11.68s)]
*  candidate for state office, in connection with a string of recent shootings. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=16.6s)]
*  According to police, Peña was the mastermind behind a conspiracy in which he enlisted the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=21.64s)]
*  help of four other men to shoot at the homes of four local Democratic officials. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=28.0s)]
*  It all stems from Peña's unsuccessful bid for a state legislator seat back in November. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=33.04s)]
*  Following his loss, the Trump loyalist and self-proclaimed MAGA king took to social media [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=38.76s)]
*  to insist without evidence that his election was rigged. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=43.76s)]
*  I wonder where he got that idea from. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=48.64s)]
*  Look, in the weeks that followed, Peña showed up at houses where he believed Democratic [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=50.72s)]
*  officials lived to complain about his loss. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=55.96s)]
*  But police say things got much more sinister when Peña allegedly hired four individuals [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=58.8s)]
*  to carry out drive-by shootings. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=63.4s)]
*  These shootings are the latest example of a worrying trend on the right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=65.8s)]
*  Hateful rhetoric fueling real-world violence. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=70.64s)]
*  Remember back in 2020 when right-wing fanatics plotted to kidnap Michigan's Democratic governor, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=74.88s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=79.72s)]
*  Or last October, when an attacker assaulted the husband of then-speaker Nancy Pelosi with [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=81.04s)]
*  a hammer. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=85.44s)]
*  According to officials, the U.S. Capitol Police investigated over 7,000 threats against members [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=86.44s)]
*  of Congress last year. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  And despite these damning facts, some Republicans have dug their heels into election denialism, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=94.0s)]
*  and some have actually benefited from that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=99.4s)]
*  Some of the most fervent election deniers in Congress have now landed seats on the Oversight [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  and Accountability Committee, which is the main investigative body in the House of Representatives. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=106.28s)]
*  And two of those members, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, were removed from committees [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=111.36s)]
*  by Democrats in the last Congress over internet posts they made advocating for violence against [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=115.76s)]
*  their political enemies. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=121.32s)]
*  So while Republicans have continued to condemn the acts of political violence carried out [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=123.24s)]
*  by the fringe of their party, it is clear they have done nothing to address the underlying [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=127.38s)]
*  cause. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  By promoting dangerous beliefs in the politicians who pushed them, the Republican Party has [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=134.2s)]
*  effectively normalized this kind of violent rhetoric that can put people in real danger. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=138.36s)]
*  And this week, a 10-year-old was almost caught in the crosshairs of the GOP's obsession with [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=144.28s)]
*  election conspiracies. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=149.24s)]
*  Here to discuss this is New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=151.8s)]
*  Madam Secretary, thank you so much for joining us this evening. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  I want you to explain to our viewers, if you can, whether or not you see a trace or a line [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=159.56s)]
*  between the rise in violence based on the political rhetoric and the political action [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  that we are seeing in the political rhetoric that we are seeing come out of Republicans, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=171.72s)]
*  like the recent shootings that we saw in your home state. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=176.56s)]
*  Well, hey there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for having me tonight. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=181.16s)]
*  And yes, I do. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is exactly the issue that I have been talking about for the last couple of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  years. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, the rhetoric, the saber rattling that happened in the lead up to the 2020 election, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  the post 2020 issues that we saw the January 6th insurrection. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  And then now, of course, what we are seeing today in the form of this individual who decided [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=202.12s)]
*  to take up arms and actually commit acts of violence, not just acts of political rhetoric [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=207.16s)]
*  against people that he disagrees with. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=215.28s)]
*  You have been an election official for about 15 years or so. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=217.76s)]
*  Talk to us about how that has evolved. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=221.44s)]
*  I think a lot of us in this country would have not necessarily known the name or the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=223.48s)]
*  faces of our election officials. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=229.04s)]
*  But as we have seen everything from secretary of states to governors to even poll workers, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=231.12s)]
*  poll watchers, they have now faced serious real world dangers. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=236.16s)]
*  No, that's exactly right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=241.64s)]
*  You know, the biggest challenge I think that we had when I started running elections at [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=244.88s)]
*  county level here in New Mexico well over a decade ago was that, you know, folks would, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=248.56s)]
*  you know, get their, you know, get cranky because a process takes too long or something [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=255.0s)]
*  like that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=261.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=262.0s)]
*  Now we are seeing, you know, every day myself, my colleagues. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=263.0s)]
*  And then, of course, you know, this is the most sort of hideous example of political [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=268.24s)]
*  we've seen, but threats, you know, accusations, character assassination. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=273.6s)]
*  And it all comes directly from the big lie. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  It all comes from that rhetoric of 2020 that the election was rigged because one person [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  could not understand that he had lost an election. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=286.6s)]
*  And so this is the reality of that rhetoric. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=290.5s)]
*  This is how it continues to transpire through actions as opposed to just words. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=292.72s)]
*  So let's talk about safety. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, Peña was able to, as I understand it, was able to locate these officials, these [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=302.08s)]
*  democratic officials relatively easily. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=306.76s)]
*  We live in a world where people's information is posted online, accessible to really anyone [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=309.12s)]
*  with a search engine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=314.28s)]
*  He was able to find their home addresses, perhaps more specific details. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=316.88s)]
*  Is there anything that should be taken? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  Is there any action your office can take to shield this kind of private information about [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=324.0s)]
*  elected officials from being public? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=328.4s)]
*  I mean, we live in a transparent society where we want to know who our elected officials [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=331.36s)]
*  are and we want to know as much about them as possible for the sake of transparency. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=335.32000000000005s)]
*  But is that also a risk now? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  It is a risk. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  We are taking a look at that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, we have to balance the fact that even I, as a public official, right, the voters [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  of the state deserve to know that I'm a resident of the state generally where I live. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  But you know, I, as you know, I have been a victim of doxing, right? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  So with a dedicated effort to pointing folks towards my home, where I live with my family, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=359.16s)]
*  and encouraging them to do political violence. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=366.44s)]
*  So we are looking at actions that we can take at the state level to make it a little less [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=368.8s)]
*  accessible, a little more challenging. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=374.04s)]
*  Or actually, should I say that you have to give a little more information about yourself [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=376.48s)]
*  if you want an elected official's home address? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=381.6s)]
*  We're looking at all of those kinds of things. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=383.68s)]
*  There's proposals, federal proposals, that would significantly boost security funding [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=386.04s)]
*  for election officials and heightened penalties for those who threaten their staff. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=390.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, it failed to advance in the last Congress. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=396.04s)]
*  Again, now with the House under Republican control, do you have any hope that legislation [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=399.52s)]
*  aimed at protecting officials, election officials, could pass? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=404.08s)]
*  I mean, could the party that is involved in promoting denialism and stolen elections and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=407.32s)]
*  elections being rigged, care about or go and pass legislation to protect election officials [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=412.96s)]
*  they accuse of stealing elections? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=420.36s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope so. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=423.4s)]
*  I think two things. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=425.4s)]
*  I think, first of all, it's really important to note that public officials who have been [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=426.6s)]
*  the victims of threats and now this actual real violence, they're not just Democrats. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=432.08s)]
*  Many of my really wonderful colleagues from the other side of the aisle have also been [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=439.44s)]
*  victims of very serious threats of violence, intimidation and harassment. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=444.08s)]
*  Secondly, what I choose to believe, and I think it's true, is that what we're talking [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=448.84s)]
*  about is a very vocal, but a very vocal minority on the Republican side. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=454.88s)]
*  I hope that we can continue to make the case to every member of Congress to bring over [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=460.96s)]
*  enough support from Republicans on the House side. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  Those reasonable Republicans who understand this is not a partisan issue, this is an American [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=468.04s)]
*  issue, we have to protect those who ensure that our democracy continues to thrive. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=472.76s)]
*  So I'm going to continue to remain hopeful and optimistic and continue to make that case [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=478.56s)]
*  to anybody who will listen. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=483.12s)]
*  And we certainly hope that people do listen. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=484.64s)]
*  New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse-Oliver, thank you so much, Madam Secretary, for your [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=487.4s)]
*  time. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=491.0s)]
*  I greatly appreciate it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=492.0s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6rkiYYq0PM&t=493.0s)]
