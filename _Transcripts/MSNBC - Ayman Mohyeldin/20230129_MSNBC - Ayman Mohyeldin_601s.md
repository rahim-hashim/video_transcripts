# Tyre Nichols' killing reignites calls for federal police reform
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow)
*  We begin this hour with the breaking news on the tragic death of 29-year-old Tyreen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=0.0s)]
*  Nichols at the hands of police in Memphis, Tennessee. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=8.64s)]
*  There are demonstrations again tonight in cities across the nation after Friday's release [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  of four harrowing videos of the deadly police assault. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  This comes as the Memphis Police Department announced it has permanently deactivated its [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=20.18s)]
*  so-called Scorpion Unit. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=23.8s)]
*  That's the group all five of the officers involved in Tyreen Nichols' death were members [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=25.72s)]
*  of. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=29.94s)]
*  And those officers have already been fired by the police department and they are now [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=30.94s)]
*  charged with his murder. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=34.34s)]
*  It is an important first step towards justice for Nichols and his family, but that is just [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=36.7s)]
*  it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=41.3s)]
*  It is a first step. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=42.3s)]
*  We have to ask why does this keep happening? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=43.3s)]
*  George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Dante [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Wright, Andre Hill. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=50.58s)]
*  They all died at the hands of police, leading to protest after protest, and yet nothing [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=52.540000000000006s)]
*  has been done at the federal level to reform policing in America. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=58.94s)]
*  President Biden has vowed to sign into law a comprehensive and meaningful police reform [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=63.42s)]
*  bill while he is in office, but the odds of passing anything significant, let alone comprehensive, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=66.86s)]
*  seems vanishingly small. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=73.26s)]
*  Remember Republican Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=75.86s)]
*  Back in 2021, he and Democratic Senator Cory Booker began working on a police reform bill, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=79.12s)]
*  but that effort ultimately fell apart. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  Now there appear to be no major efforts in Congress to reform policing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=86.9s)]
*  Why not? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=91.14s)]
*  Well, Democrats no longer control the House, and the new Republican majority seems much [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=92.14s)]
*  more interested in investigating Hunter Biden and the FBI than any real governance. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=97.06s)]
*  But it wasn't always that way. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=102.5s)]
*  Remember for the first two years of the Biden White House, Democrats actually had control [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=104.34s)]
*  of both chambers of Congress. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=108.58000000000001s)]
*  So why didn't they seize the opportunity and get anything done? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=111.18s)]
*  You can thank these two, Senators Kristen Sinema and Joe Manchin. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=115.66s)]
*  It was Sinema and Manchin who dug in their heels to block filibuster reform, and that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=119.7s)]
*  meant to get anything done, Democrats had to secure 60 votes instead of a simple 50 [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  vote majority. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=130.1s)]
*  Preserving the filibuster effectively killed a wide range of Democratic legislative priorities, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=131.7s)]
*  including police reform. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=137.1s)]
*  And look, here's Sinema and Manchin high-fiving each other just last week at Davos over their [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=139.06s)]
*  efforts to block filibuster reform. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=145.86s)]
*  Great job guys. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=150.1s)]
*  Well done. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=151.5s)]
*  But here's the thing, they weren't just high-fiving the failure of filibuster reform, they were [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=153.3s)]
*  high-fiving the failure of police reform, and that's the consequence they own tonight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=158.4s)]
*  Joining me now is California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=165.62s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for being here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  I want to start with your reaction to the death of Tyree Nichols at the hands of Memphis [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=171.46s)]
*  police. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity and for giving exposure to what [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  has happened with the brutal beating and killing of Tyree Nichols. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=182.62s)]
*  I'm grieving along with his family and friends. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm a black mom, and when I hear that he was asking them, please, you know, don't beat [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=194.78s)]
*  me, he called for his mom the same way George Floyd did. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=202.42s)]
*  Us black moms and black grandmothers, we feel this pain very deeply. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=208.14s)]
*  I don't have any really great hopes for the fact that we're going to be able to pass police [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  reform. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  It is racism in its purest form. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=221.45999999999998s)]
*  How can you not be outraged by the killings of human beings when you see that they have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=225.29999999999998s)]
*  been beaten, the chokehold has been used, a knee has been placed on George Floyd's neck, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  when you find that going back to Rodney King, the vicious beatings that took place, how [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  difficult it was to try and get justice there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=245.38s)]
*  And so it's a struggle, and it's a fight, and they want us to be quiet. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm angry, as many of us are, and I don't care whether it's a white cop or a black cop. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=254.7s)]
*  If they are brutally beating and targeting and killing young black and brown men and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=261.18s)]
*  some women, we've got to stay out there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=267.42s)]
*  We've got to protest. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=270.22s)]
*  We've got to challenge them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=271.82s)]
*  We've got to say to the police associations that we're going to stop elected officials [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=273.58s)]
*  from taking your money so that they will not act against you when you are basically protecting [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=279.44s)]
*  these rogue cops. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=286.24s)]
*  So we've got to do all of this work. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=287.88s)]
*  And some people don't like it when I say stay on the street. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=290.04s)]
*  Protest. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=293.6s)]
*  Yes, and I'll say it again, as I said it years ago, no justice, no peace. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=294.6s)]
*  I want to ask you about federal police reform for a moment, because it could have happened, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=301.88s)]
*  it could have been accomplished when Democrats controlled the House and the Senate and the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=305.84s)]
*  White House, if Senators Kristin Sinema and Joe Manchin had allowed for filibuster reform. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=309.56s)]
*  What do you have to say to them now? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Because police reform and voting reform were the two issues that people across this country, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=318.4s)]
*  certainly Democratic activists, were using as examples as to why the filibuster needed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=324.44s)]
*  to be reformed. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=330.64s)]
*  These were life and death situations that people needed to have passed, and they blocked [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=331.64s)]
*  it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=338.44s)]
*  Well, you know, when you say what do you say to them? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=339.44s)]
*  They're the same people today that they were when they blocked police reform by, you know, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=343.44s)]
*  just insisting on the 60 person vote. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=350.8s)]
*  And so I don't have any faith in either of them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=354.0s)]
*  I don't trust them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=357.96s)]
*  I don't believe that they're going to change. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=359.8s)]
*  And so I think it is only when the people of this country organize and really deal with [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  local elected officials who control their budgets to deal with not allowing them all [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=369.48s)]
*  of the overtime some of them get that don't really deserve it, when they understand that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  they must elect police chiefs that are willing to punish and they're willing to do what we [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  just saw happen in Memphis. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=388.68s)]
*  I don't think that they are going to change. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=391.52s)]
*  They're just whom they are, and they're not going to change at all. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=394.6s)]
*  I know that, you know, politicians try to sound optimistic as much as they can. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=398.64s)]
*  But right now, with the leadership that we see in the House, is there any path forward [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=403.72s)]
*  for police reform in Congress after this latest tragic killing? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=408.32s)]
*  Give it to us straight. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=412.68s)]
*  I know that Mr. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican caucus, and you heard what McCarthy said. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=414.88s)]
*  He said he just loves her and that he's going to do everything he can to protect her. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  And she's saying in so many ways and words, and I own him. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=427.88s)]
*  And so I don't expect anything from them. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=431.88s)]
*  We're going to try to do everything that we possibly can. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=434.44s)]
*  But I think, you know, the average American person can see what is going on. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=438.08s)]
*  We have these right-wing conservatives who are, you know, we have domestic terrorists [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=443.44s)]
*  in the House of Representatives. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=449.04s)]
*  These people are extremists. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=451.12s)]
*  And so I'm not optimistic that that's the way it's going to happen until the people [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=453.28s)]
*  of this country really decide that they don't want it and they're not going to elect people [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=459.44s)]
*  who act in the fashion that they act. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=465.6s)]
*  I want to turn now to what has been going on in Congress politically. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  House Republicans demanding spending cuts as a price for lifting the debt ceiling. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  They have yet to come up with a plan. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=478.24s)]
*  Certainly, I haven't seen one. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=480.32s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen one. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=481.32s)]
*  What do you make of where this is going right now? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=483.36s)]
*  Well, they're threatening us. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=485.6s)]
*  And they're trying to hold up what we need to do to raise the debt limit. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=488.68s)]
*  And even though you hear from time to time that there are those in the Republican caucus [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=494.28s)]
*  who are willing to cut Social Security and Medicare, and then you'll hear some say, oh, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=499.28s)]
*  no, we're not going to do that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=504.68s)]
*  They're divided, I think, on the issue. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  I know McCarthy would like to negotiate these cuts. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=509.56s)]
*  They don't even know what the cuts are, totally. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpMCjcnIow&t=512.96s)]
