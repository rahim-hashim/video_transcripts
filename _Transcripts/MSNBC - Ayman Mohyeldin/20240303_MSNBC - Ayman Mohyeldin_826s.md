# Filmmaker Michael Moore says Michigan's 'Uncommitted' campaign can save Biden from himself
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI)
*  Michigan will be one to watch this November for several reasons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=0.0s)]
*  During Tuesday night's Democratic primary, more than 100,000 [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Michiganders sent a message to President Biden, casting an uncommitted [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=7.68s)]
*  vote in protest of his administration's handling of Israel's war on Gaza. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=11.72s)]
*  A reminder in 2020, Biden won Michigan by fewer than 150,000 votes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=16.92s)]
*  While he still won Tuesday night's primary, the uncommitted movement [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  does not stop with Michigan and will not until Biden shows [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  that he hears the message being sent. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=29.88s)]
*  As Joe Nichols puts it in The Nation, the message was blunt. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=32.56s)]
*  Biden's presidency could hang in the balance if he does not pay attention [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  to voters he needs in November. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=40.36s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this is Academy Award winning filmmaker Michael Moore. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  He is also part of the group Listen to Michigan, which helped [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=46.36s)]
*  organize the uncommitted push. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=49.44s)]
*  Michael, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=51.6s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time for us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=52.84s)]
*  Earlier this week, you said what Biden is participating in is something [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=55.16s)]
*  that is killing civilians and children. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=59.04s)]
*  More than 30,000 Palestinians have now been killed in this ongoing war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  At this point, does the president stand a chance at winning back [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=65.8s)]
*  some of those or any of those uncommitted voters? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=69.96s)]
*  Would calling for a ceasefire at this moment be enough? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=72.32s)]
*  No, but it would go a long way. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=78.08s)]
*  I can't speak for everybody who voted, obviously. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=81.64s)]
*  We organized this campaign. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=84.48s)]
*  Listen to Michigan, Mr. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=86.28s)]
*  President, please. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=88.0s)]
*  We organize this in less than three weeks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=89.64s)]
*  So, I mean, this was the most amazing thing to have happened. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=92.12s)]
*  They have over 100,000 Michiganders, Democrats. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=95.32s)]
*  I would say the majority, vast majority of whom voted for Biden in 2020 [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=100.0s)]
*  to come out and vote uncommitted to send that message to the president [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=106.76s)]
*  that not only must there be a ceasefire now, but that we must [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=111.84s)]
*  stop, as Senator Sanders said earlier today, we must stop sending. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=117.56s)]
*  We shouldn't send another nickel is what he said. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=123.92s)]
*  In bombs, guns, planes, bullets to Israel until they stop this madness. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=127.28s)]
*  And I think that that is how people felt going to the polls on Tuesday, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=134.88s)]
*  that we needed to send a strong message. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=140.84s)]
*  Now, for people listening to this, something, oh, why are we [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=144.32s)]
*  throwing the election to Trump? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=147.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=150.28s)]
*  I don't, honest. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=151.4s)]
*  One thing I think I feel safe saying is that those who voted uncommitted on [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  Tuesday are not going to vote for Trump. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  My fear and the reason why those of us started this campaign is to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=162.32s)]
*  basically save Biden from himself. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=166.72s)]
*  Because because of what he's done to support this massacre, to fund it, to be [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=169.44s)]
*  the bank for Israel to in there in the slaughter of these people that he is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=174.68s)]
*  essentially guaranteeing that thousands and thousands of Americans are going to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=182.8s)]
*  stay home and not vote on election day because they're not going to vote for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  Trump. But this is how Trump could win. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=191.12s)]
*  Because because those that hundred and fifty thousand won by in 2020, Hillary [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=194.16s)]
*  lost Michigan by just eleven thousand votes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  That's two votes on average, two votes per precinct in Michigan. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  That's it. That's how close this could be. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=208.16s)]
*  And to have a hundred thousand plus come out on Tuesday and say, you know what? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=211.04s)]
*  Our conscience will not allow us to support this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  Right. And and and if people say, well, so does your conscience allow you to let [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=220.92s)]
*  Trump win? No, no. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=225.84s)]
*  What it means actually to me personally is that now I've got to double and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  quadruple my efforts to make sure Trump loses because Biden is working against me. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=231.92s)]
*  Biden is working against the Democrats, the Democrats in Michigan. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=238.68s)]
*  First of all, 75 percent of the people in Michigan, according to the last poll I [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=243.6s)]
*  saw, are want the ceasefire and want this massacre to stop. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=247.12s)]
*  That's Republicans and Democrats. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=252.92s)]
*  So the fact that Joe Biden isn't listening to the people is a sad thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=255.64s)]
*  It's going to hurt him if if he doesn't change and change now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=259.68s)]
*  And going on TV a couple of days before the primary with Seth Meyers, poor Seth [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=264.84s)]
*  stuck with the ice cream cone there with Biden. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=271.24s)]
*  And, you know, when Biden promised that there would be a ceasefire by this Monday. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=275.08s)]
*  Right. I doesn't from your reporting here on MSNBC, that doesn't sound like that's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=280.52s)]
*  going to happen. And so. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  So, you know, what do we we don't want Trump back in there do at this point? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  Because and I and again, I can't speak on behalf of the Arab and Muslim Americans [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=293.32s)]
*  in Michigan who voted, but I've heard from enough of them and I've heard from enough [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=299.12s)]
*  young people of all ethnicities and races and genders. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=304.12s)]
*  Young people hate war mainly because they're the ones sent to war to die. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=311.2s)]
*  To die in the wars. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  Can I ask you about that real quick, though? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=318.28s)]
*  Can I ask you that you bring up a really important point that I want to ask you about [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  because how broad is this coalition? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=323.52s)]
*  There is this perception, certainly some in the mainstream media are trying to portray [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=325.23999999999995s)]
*  this as an Arab American thing or a Muslim American thing saying, hey, the guy on the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=329.4s)]
*  other side wants to deport you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  You're a part of this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=335.52s)]
*  You tell us how broad is this coalition that is behind this uncommitted vote? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  Who is it? Listen, I'm going to like tell tales out of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  school here. Those of us who were involved in or helping organize and promote this on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=346.2s)]
*  Tuesday that was in the Michigan campaign. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=351.8s)]
*  We were hoping for to get maybe 10 to 15000 votes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=355.12s)]
*  That was it. A few people, the optimists thought maybe 30,000. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=359.84s)]
*  The fact that it was over 100000 means it was a broad. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=365.48s)]
*  It wasn't just the 9000 people in Dearborn or the other Arab cities in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=369.56s)]
*  Michigan where we have an Arab American mayor and an Arab American city council. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=376.0s)]
*  I am trammick Michigan. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=380.2s)]
*  No, this was of course, yes, it was Muslims and it was Arab Americans. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=381.84s)]
*  But it was also vast, vast numbers of young people who just said, that's it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=387.24s)]
*  I'm out. I'm not going to vote for Trump, but I'm out of this. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=393.04s)]
*  If this guy is going to continue the war, if he's going to continue to embrace Netanyahu, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=396.6s)]
*  I will not participate in this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=401.6s)]
*  And so you had young people, you had progressives, you have all kinds of Democrats. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=403.8s)]
*  As I said, the vast majority of Democrats and all the polls are against Biden funding [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=408.4s)]
*  and arming this war. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=413.84s)]
*  So why wouldn't Biden listen to this? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  He wouldn't even acknowledge it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=418.91999999999996s)]
*  And when he won the primary and thanking the people of Michigan, just didn't just [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=420.08s)]
*  ignore the 100000 people. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=426.24s)]
*  If if, as Michelle Goldberg said in The New York Times last Friday, if he loses Michigan, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  he loses the election. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=435.24s)]
*  Why would you risk that? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=437.0s)]
*  Yeah, President Biden. Why? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=438.08s)]
*  Why are you? This is when you need to be a politician. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=440.44s)]
*  It's what you should do is the moral thing, which is stop the carpet bombing, stop the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=443.28s)]
*  slaughter, make sure aid comes in. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=449.44s)]
*  Don't be dropping aid with parachutes like it was some kind of Looney Tunes cartoon. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=452.12s)]
*  You know, you've got two million people starving to death and you're and you're [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  dropping a few hundred parachutes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=463.84s)]
*  Is it is that a joke? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=466.36s)]
*  Is that like the ice cream announcing the we're going to have a ceasefire by Monday? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=467.76s)]
*  You know, this is not funny. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=473.12s)]
*  This is not a joke. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=475.64s)]
*  And the young people of Michigan, the people of color of Michigan, I mean, Michigan, we [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=477.24s)]
*  have what 1314 black cities, majority black cities, Detroit, Flint, Saginaw, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=482.36s)]
*  Benton Harbor, Pontiac. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  These are African-American cities. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=491.4s)]
*  They don't support this. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=493.79999999999995s)]
*  It's it's you know, but they supported by the I support Biden. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=495.88s)]
*  We voted for Biden. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=499.44s)]
*  We want to vote for him again. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=500.76s)]
*  And and and and but a lot of people and this is what I was saying about our friends in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=503.32s)]
*  the in the Detroit area who are Palestinian, who have family members who have died in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=509.08s)]
*  these last almost five months. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=515.92s)]
*  Family members that have been killed by their in Dearborn in Detroit, their tax [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=518.32s)]
*  dollars, they help to fund the slaughter of their grandparents, their cousins, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=524.72s)]
*  their nieces, their nephews. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=529.36s)]
*  And I'm just asking anybody who's watching this right now, who's not Arab, not [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=531.08s)]
*  Muslim, if you discovered that the United States, your country funded and carried [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=534.8s)]
*  out through the production of these arms that are given to Israel, carried out the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=542.08s)]
*  slaughter of your grandparents. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=547.8000000000001s)]
*  Tell me what you would do. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=550.88s)]
*  Tell me how would you vote or would you maybe not vote at all and just sit it out [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=553.0s)]
*  because you're so, so upset, so disgusted with the murder of innocent civilians, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  two thirds of whom are children and women and elderly. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=564.5200000000001s)]
*  You know, I mean, just these are real people, Detroiters, who have lost hundreds of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=568.92s)]
*  people who have lost or have wounded family members or who are starving to death right [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=575.04s)]
*  now in Gaza. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=581.4s)]
*  What we were just asking you fellow white people, what would you do? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=583.12s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=589.0s)]
*  And why is there even why is there an open air prison called Gaza for 15 years? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=590.0s)]
*  You know, when people are in prisons because they've committed a crime, can somebody [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=596.28s)]
*  right now tell me what the crime is that the Palestinian people as a group of people [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=599.12s)]
*  have committed? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=604.52s)]
*  What is the crime? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=605.52s)]
*  Because according to my knowledge of history, the enemies of Israel who have been [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=606.56s)]
*  persecuted, the Israelis, the Jewish people of this world have been persecuted for 5000 [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=612.16s)]
*  years. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=617.6s)]
*  But for the last 2000 years, most of the persecution has come from white, European [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=618.72s)]
*  centric Christians. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=625.16s)]
*  That's been your enemy. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=627.44s)]
*  No Palestinian helped to build Auschwitz. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=628.76s)]
*  No Palestinian stood on the docks of New York City when boatloads of Jewish refugees [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=631.32s)]
*  tried to escape the Holocaust came here to be protected by this country and were turned [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=636.72s)]
*  away at the docks in New York and sent back to Germany to die. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=641.88s)]
*  No Palestinian did that. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=645.8s)]
*  No Palestinian ran the Spanish Inquisition. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  Your enemy, your enemy is not the Palestinian people. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=649.88s)]
*  It is white Christian European people who have been slaughtering Jews for the last [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=655.12s)]
*  2000 years. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=663.16s)]
*  And let's just call it for what it is. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=664.92s)]
*  But why are they in an open air prison? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=666.8s)]
*  Why are two million of them in an open air prison? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=668.92s)]
*  I'm sorry to go on so long. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=674.4s)]
*  No, no, you bring up so many important points. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=675.6s)]
*  And I know we can talk about this for hours, but I did just want to kind of get your final [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  thought about this because it is kind of becoming such an important issue in the primaries. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=682.4s)]
*  Do you think Joe Biden is gambling American democracy, given the fact that the alternative [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  is a guy who says he's going to be a dictator, is a guy who says he is going to be an [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=691.84s)]
*  authoritarian on day one? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=696.88s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump is the threat that he is? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=698.36s)]
*  And Joe Biden is gambling by aligning himself closely with Netanyahu at the risk of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=702.24s)]
*  American democracy. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=707.84s)]
*  Absolutely. And gambling by aligning himself with an authoritarian in Tel Aviv, somebody [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=709.6s)]
*  who is facing a number of felonious charges, who was supposed to stay in trial this past [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=717.08s)]
*  fall. And that all got shoved aside because now there's a war. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=723.2800000000001s)]
*  And so we can't put our prime minister on trial. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=727.5200000000001s)]
*  The Joe Biden and I'm just I plead with him, do not put Trump back in the White House. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  You are you are. I am not going to be able to go on enough shows on TV between now and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=739.68s)]
*  the election to convince literally millions of young people that you got to vote because [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=745.8399999999999s)]
*  Trump's Trump's a bad guy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=751.52s)]
*  Well, you know, do you know any young people? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=754.04s)]
*  Those of you watching me right now, you should talk to them. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=756.56s)]
*  You should see what they think about this and it should frighten you because and there's [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=759.52s)]
*  nothing you're going to do to convince your son or daughter or niece or nephew to do the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=764.68s)]
*  right thing. Many of us will do that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=769.9599999999999s)]
*  We will we will be out there. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=773.04s)]
*  We will triple our efforts to help make sure Trump doesn't come back in the White House. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=774.8s)]
*  But why do we have to do this? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=779.6s)]
*  Why can't Biden just stop it right now? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=781.0799999999999s)]
*  Call for the ceasefire. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=783.9599999999999s)]
*  No more money for armaments to Israel. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=785.28s)]
*  And insist that that Israel. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=788.44s)]
*  Right. Go to its core. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=790.6800000000001s)]
*  You are you are the you are the you are the religion that has always stood for something [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=794.0s)]

*  I hear you. I know. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=807.12s)]
*  I sense the frustration in your voice, Michael. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=808.5200000000001s)]
*  Let's hope the president is watching or certainly somebody around him is watching this and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=812.2s)]
*  can get that message to him. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSb3srONXnI&t=816.2s)]
