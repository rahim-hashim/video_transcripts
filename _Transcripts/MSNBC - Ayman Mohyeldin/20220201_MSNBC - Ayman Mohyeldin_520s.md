# Stansbury On The GOP: 'The Moment Demands That New Leaders Step Up.'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs)
*  Tonight, I'm asking, what kind of reckoning is the Republican Party going through when [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=0.0s)]
*  they continue to embolden a man that said this just last night about the insurrection [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=7.2s)]
*  intended to topple our democracy on January 6th? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=13.0s)]
*  If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6th fairly. We will treat [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=17.6s)]
*  them fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons because they are being [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=25.48s)]
*  treated so unfairly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Now no one should be pardoned for what they did in January the 6th. Trump also called [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=38.28s)]
*  on supporters to mount large protests in cities like Atlanta and New York if prosecutors who [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=45.0s)]
*  are investigating him and his businesses take action against him. Have we learned nothing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=50.54s)]
*  from the last time? January 6th was traumatizing for us as a country, especially for those [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=55.82s)]
*  lawmakers inside the Capitol that day. But we continue to be re-traumatized again and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=60.22s)]
*  again as figures in the Republican Party prop up a man who continues to use the same inflammatory [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=65.24s)]
*  language for political gain. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=71.14s)]
*  Joining me now is freshman Congresswoman Melanie Stansberry from New Mexico. Congresswoman, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=73.02s)]
*  thank you so much for your time this evening. Former President Trump, in fact, had a statement [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=78.54s)]
*  out this evening referring to the bipartisan effort to reform the electoral count, which [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=83.30000000000001s)]
*  is gaining some traction in Congress. In fact, he continued to push that Vice President Mike [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=88.26s)]
*  Pence had the power to overturn the election. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=92.54s)]
*  Obviously, I see that as a flat out admission of guilt for what he was trying to do on January [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=96.14000000000001s)]
*  the 6th. You see it there on the bottom of the screen. What's your take on this statement [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=101.06s)]
*  tonight that he believed that Mike Pence could have overturned the election? That's what [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=107.02s)]
*  he wanted him to do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=111.26s)]
*  Well, Eamon, thank you so much for having me on tonight. What is clear is that we know [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=112.26s)]
*  that the Trump Organization engaged in criminal activity with regards to the steal of this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=117.94s)]
*  election. And in fact, here in New Mexico, in my own state, we know that two members [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=124.94s)]
*  of our GOP have actually been subpoenaed by the January 6th special committee. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=131.54s)]
*  And what we know is that fake electors were actually sending forward documents that were [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=137.54s)]
*  signifying that Trump had won the election in states like New Mexico, where that is clearly [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=146.5s)]
*  false. In fact, in New Mexico, Trump lost and Biden won by 11 points, by 99,000 votes [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  in our state. This is criminal activity and our state laws. It's been referred by our [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=157.34s)]
*  AG for federal action. And we must find out and get to the bottom of what happened at [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=162.1s)]
*  the federal level. So our select committee will be investigating these charges along [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=166.94s)]
*  with everything else that's been going on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=172.22s)]
*  Yeah. And speaking of the select committee, the January 6th committee said it is subpoenaing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=174.66s)]
*  more than two dozen people involved in the fake elector scheme following the 2020 election. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=179.34s)]
*  So two of those individuals from your home state of New Mexico, does it surprise you [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=184.7s)]
*  how far the former president supporters went to overturn the election? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=189.42s)]
*  I think that it's shocking to see the degree to which local officials, especially in the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=194.42s)]
*  state of New Mexico and all across the country, participated in this huge lie and fabrication [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  and effort to steal our democracy. The foundation of our democracy is open, free and fair elections. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=209.22s)]
*  And I am appalled and disgusted to see that local officials in my own state, including [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=217.3s)]
*  in our state GOP, have participated in these activities, which are clearly criminal and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  were clearly designed to overturn the will of the people. And we really have to get to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  the bottom of these issues. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=232.82000000000002s)]
*  I want to move on to your work that you're doing in Washington. You've already gained [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=235.7s)]
*  quite the reputation when it comes to climate policy. And thank God there is someone who's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=238.82s)]
*  out there fighting for climate policy in a meaningful way. Your colleagues have actually [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=244.38s)]
*  described you as a policy wonk with a staffer level knowledge about environmental issues. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=248.22s)]
*  How did climate become such an important cause for you? And more importantly, I can understand [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=255.26s)]
*  why it has become a cause for you. Why do you think from what you've seen so far in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=259.3s)]
*  Congress, has it not been a cause for your colleagues? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=263.74s)]
*  Well, I've worked on climate and water resilience my entire career. I've actually worked at [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=267.02s)]
*  the nexus between science and sustainability and social justice since I was a kid. My background [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=274.14s)]
*  is as a science educator and I've worked especially in water resources throughout my career. And [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=279.98s)]
*  during the Obama administration, I worked in the White House Council on Environmental [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=284.94s)]
*  Quality and OMB and the U.S. Senate. And like so many young, new people who came to politics [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=288.94s)]
*  after the 2016 election, I ran for office because I believe deeply that we can bring [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=295.26s)]
*  meaningful change not only to our political system, but that the moment demands that new [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=301.18s)]
*  leaders step up and step into spaces that they have never been before to really fight [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=306.9s)]
*  for the issues that we care about like climate change. And what I believe is that we're really [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  at this inflection moment globally in terms of solving our climate crisis. We know that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=317.38s)]
*  the problem is a chemistry problem, an economics problem, and a political problem. And we have [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  the ability to solve those problems in terms of the chemistry and the policy, but we have [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=328.82s)]
*  not yet mustered the political will to make it happen. And that's why it's so important [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=334.62s)]
*  that there's leaders like myself and so many of the new young leaders who are in Congress [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=339.38s)]
*  serving in our legislatures across the country who are out there fighting every single day to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=343.88s)]
*  get meaningful legislation passed. Now, with respect to what happens next in Congress, we [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=348.6s)]
*  have to get the bill back Better Act passed. It is the best opportunity that we have in the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=354.48s)]
*  immediate future to solve the climate crisis. It makes the largest single investment in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  climate change our country has ever made over a half a trillion dollars and really tries to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=365.8s)]
*  address this problem in a multifaceted and multi-sectoral way. So we have to get this bill [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=371.12s)]
*  across the finish line and then we have to double down and help support our communities and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  lift up those community-based solutions so that we can start to combat climate change on the ground. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=381.4s)]
*  Let's talk about Build Back Better for a moment. As you just mentioned there, it's a major part of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=387.72s)]
*  President Biden's efforts to combat the climate crisis. That legislation is back to the negotiating [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=391.44s)]
*  table as you know after Senator Manchin pulled his support for it last month. Realistically [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=397.8s)]
*  speaking, what are both some of the non-negotiable items that you have for that bill and do you think [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=402.68s)]
*  Democrats can get it done if they approach it from a different way such as breaking up the items in [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=408.16s)]
*  that bill and trying to pass them a standalone? Is that the approach that you think can see some [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=413.44s)]
*  action on climate change? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=417.44s)]
*  Well, I believe that we absolutely can and will get something done. I will say that unequivocally. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  What is clear is that in order to get climate legislation and many of the social provisions [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=426.76s)]
*  across the finish line, we have to use the reconciliation process because we don't have [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  60 votes in the Senate to get meaningful climate legislation across the finish line right now. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  So what is non-negotiable in the package is that we whittle it down to something that doesn't [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=441.64s)]
*  actually address the problems and that is addressing our carbon footprint, empowering our [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=446.91999999999996s)]
*  communities to actually build a more resilient future and investing in those fundamentals that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=452.56s)]
*  we need so that our communities can plan for a more water resilient future. They can address [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=458.32s)]
*  wildfire. We can protect our public lands and our ecosystems and we can protect our infrastructure. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=463.52s)]
*  So those are some of the core pieces that are really important for climate change in the Build [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=470.0s)]
*  Back Better Act and politically speaking, I do believe that there is the political will to get the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=474.12s)]
*  Build Back Better done. I think that all of the important parties are at the table. They're [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=480.08s)]
*  having the right discussions and they're trying to find the right path forward and I think we'll [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=484.24s)]
*  get it done by the end of the year. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=488.24s)]
*  Congresswoman Melanie Stansberry from New Mexico, thank you so much for your time, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=491.2s)]
*  Congresswoman. Greatly appreciate it and best of luck to you on that important fight [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  for stopping the climate crisis. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tV4y62Wbs&t=510.08s)]
