# Michael Moore predicts 'Trump is toast' in 2024
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io)
*  There are just two days remaining until what could be the most consequential election of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=0.0s)]
*  our lifetimes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=5.62s)]
*  And NBC News is out with its final poll, which shows both Vice President Kamala Harris and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=6.62s)]
*  Donald Trump tied at 49 percent nationally. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=12.06s)]
*  But it features Harris leading among voters on the key issues of abortion, bringing the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=15.76s)]
*  country together and looking out for the middle class. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=19.86s)]
*  Notably, voters are also demonstrating more faith in Harris than Trump on the matter of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=23.92s)]
*  protecting our democracy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=29.1s)]
*  And this idea is central to Harris's final pitch to voters in these final days before [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  the election. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=36.9s)]
*  Here's what she told reporters just today in Michigan. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=38.1s)]
*  The systems that are in place for this election in 2024 have integrity. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=42.68s)]
*  They are good systems and the vote of the people will determine the outcome of this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=48.14s)]
*  election and everyone must know that their vote is their power to determine the outcome [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=53.34s)]
*  of the election and their vote will count. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=58.76s)]
*  It does matter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=60.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump's contempt for democracy was on full display during a rally in Pennsylvania [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=61.64s)]
*  earlier today. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=66.98s)]
*  Again, here is just a part of his chilling message. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=67.98s)]
*  They are fighting so hard to seal this damn thing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=73.72s)]
*  We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=77.08s)]
*  I shouldn't have left. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=81.28s)]
*  I mean, honestly, because we did so we did so well to get me somebody would have to shoot [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=82.28s)]
*  through the fake news. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=88.48s)]
*  And I don't mind that so much. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=93.4s)]
*  I don't mind. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=95.16s)]
*  Now the Trump campaign released a statement after those remarks, which feel more like [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=99.08s)]
*  gaslighting than anything else, referring to the media. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  They write, quote, he was actually looking out for their welfare far more than his own. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=106.7s)]
*  Now Trump's consistently violent rhetoric lays bare a crucial difference between our [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=112.48s)]
*  two political parties, if you want to call them that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=117.84s)]
*  In a new piece, columnist Ezra Klein wrote in the New York Times, we are used to elections [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  pitting Democrats against Republicans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  This election pits guardians against counterrevolutionaries. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=127.84s)]
*  Harris surrogates and supporters are united not by shared policy goals, but by a shared [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=132.36s)]
*  defense of American institutions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  That's the core reason that Harris's coalition is noticeably disparate among groups of people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=140.08s)]
*  As her running mate Tim Walz brags, we got Bernie Sanders, Dick Cheney and Taylor Swift [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=146.8s)]
*  on the same ticket. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=151.36s)]
*  Now leaving Taylor Swift out for a moment, what on earth do Bernie Sanders and Dick Cheney [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=152.96s)]
*  have in common besides both being Americans who simply want democracy here to survive? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=156.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Trump coalition is united by a shared distrust and desire to take control [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=164.84s)]
*  of American institutions. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=169.84s)]
*  Klein writes the Trumpist coalition isn't conservative at all. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=171.88s)]
*  It's counterrevolutionary. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=176.52s)]
*  It believes a leftist revolution has corrupted American institutions and a counterrevolution [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=177.52s)]
*  which may even require violence is necessary. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=182.72s)]
*  That's why the Trump side has elevated people like Elon Musk who has been using his social [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=187.08s)]
*  media platform and Trump rallies to peddle anti-immigrant election voter fraud conspiracies. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=191.46s)]
*  And R.F.K. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=198.04s)]
*  Jr. who built his entire failed presidential campaign around a whole host of conspiracies, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=199.04s)]
*  including baseless theories about vaccines and antidepressants. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=204.04s)]
*  And in today's Republican Party, you don't get to keep your seat at the table unless [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  you are willing to defend the biggest conspiracy of them all. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=212.64s)]
*  You think it's okay to spread false rumors about fraud and undermine the integrity of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  the election regardless of what happens? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=223.04s)]
*  Dana, the liberal media has done a better job of spreading misinformation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=227.16s)]
*  Oh, come on, Senator. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=230.96s)]
*  You believe that the election will be free and fair. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=232.16s)]
*  So does that mean that you are confident that if Donald Trump loses, I know you think he's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=235.84s)]
*  going to win, but let's just play this out, if he loses, that he will concede? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=241.6s)]
*  I'm confident that he's going to win without any question. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=249.44s)]
*  And yes, I do believe that we will have a fair election. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  We will honor the results and we will celebrate the 47th president being Donald Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=256.2s)]
*  Imagine, just for a second, imagine how different things would be if the power players within [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=261.8s)]
*  the Republican Party cared less about winning and actually more about America. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  Imagine if the GOP had turned never Trump after the Access Hollywood tape, after the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=273.52s)]
*  January 6th insurrection, after we learned about the draconian Project 2025. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=279.4s)]
*  Instead the party went all in on their winning horse, endorsing racism, xenophobia, sexism, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=286.0s)]
*  endorsing violent rhetoric and acts of violence, endorsing a backsliding of our democracy and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=292.52s)]
*  doing everything to help Trump get another four years in power, enabling Trumpism to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=299.0s)]
*  seep even deeper into the pores of America and live on far beyond 2024. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  Joining me now is Michael Moore, Academy Award winning filmmaker and host of the Michael [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=312.88s)]
*  Moore podcast. Michael, it's great to have you back on the show. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, I don't want to go back to 2016, but you obviously predicted at the time that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=320.28s)]
*  Trump would win last month, you wrote Trump is toast. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=324.67999999999995s)]
*  You know, we're almost 48 hours out from perhaps seeing our first results. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=329.4s)]
*  But do you stand behind that today? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=333.56s)]
*  Oh, even more so. I just keep wondering the gift that the Trump campaign keeps giving us. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=337.4s)]
*  They don't I don't think they realize I don't think they really are in touch with where the majority of Americans are at. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=344.56s)]
*  The majority of Americans do not want this divisiveness. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=350.64s)]
*  They don't want the threat of violence. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=353.6s)]
*  We are OK to disagree with each other, but that's where it ends. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=356.36s)]
*  We go to vote. Who wins wins half the time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=360.48s)]
*  I've been very happy with who's won in the other half of the time I haven't been. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=364.56s)]
*  And then we move on with our lives. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=369.12s)]
*  The fact that the way that I just what you just played here, I hadn't heard Trump out of those words. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=371.44s)]
*  I'd heard somebody say that he said that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=376.72s)]
*  But to hear him say that about they can shoot through the media, the assassins go ahead and fire [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=379.04s)]
*  and all those other things you just played. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=386.56s)]
*  It's like they really believe that the average normal, normal American wants to hear that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=390.8s)]
*  They actually believe that we don't like immigrants. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=398.16s)]
*  We are immigrants. We are all the children and grandchildren and great grandchildren immigrants. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=400.64s)]
*  Unless you are African-American or unless you're amongst the first peoples that were here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=405.6s)]
*  We are all the product of immigrants and we love our grandparents and our great grandparents [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=411.44s)]
*  and the people that got us here to this great country. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  And to talk about immigrants in this vicious, vile way where and you think of all the, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=418.88s)]
*  you know, the things that we have and we've given the world, you know, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=427.2s)]
*  and the anger and hatred toward Muslims and Arabs. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  Steve Jobs. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=435.36s)]
*  I mean, nobody this never gets discussed a little. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=437.12s)]
*  Maybe I'm just a trivia nerd, but he's the he was he's a born of Muslim parents. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=439.2s)]
*  His parents were Arab and they put him up for adoption. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=445.76s)]
*  They had to put him up for adoption and was adopted by a wonderful the Jobs family. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=448.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=454.24s)]
*  But we wouldn't have I wouldn't be talking to you maybe on this device right now in this way [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  without this offspring of a Muslim or an Arab. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=461.52s)]
*  And I think most Americans we get down on our knees and thank God that we are the children [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  of immigrants that we are built this country with immigrants. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=472.16s)]
*  And the fact that we have somewhere depending on what numbers you want to believe in somewhere [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  between 9 million and 11 million jobs right now that we do not have enough people to fill. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  We have we have upwards to 11 million unfilled jobs. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=490.16s)]
*  And we as we are told, we have maybe 11 million immigrants who aren't here legally. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=494.48s)]
*  Geez, doesn't that just if you have a heart, if you have love in you, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=500.64s)]
*  if you're proud of this country that was built by immigrants, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=504.72s)]
*  don't some doesn't somewhere in your head go, geez, we need 11 million jobs filled. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  We have 11 million people that need citizenship. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=512.4s)]
*  Why don't we go there? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=516.16s)]
*  Well, I do. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=517.44s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are like me. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=518.24s)]
*  And I think that they are going to be very surprised. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=520.48s)]
*  I'm talking about the Trump people and the Magna Nation by what's going to happen on [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=523.12s)]
*  Tuesday. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=527.5200000000001s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=528.0s)]
*  Not only do I feel to answer your question 10 minutes later that I feel the same way that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=528.32s)]
*  I felt a few weeks ago that Trump is toast. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=534.4000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  I felt I feel it more now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=538.08s)]
*  I know I don't want to say it too loudly because our work isn't done. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=544.0s)]
*  We all have doors to knock on tomorrow. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=544.32s)]
*  We all have to make sure we get people to vote. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=546.64s)]
*  I've asked everybody to think of three people that maybe they know at work or school or [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  whatever that aren't going to vote to get them to the polls, drive them to the polls, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=553.12s)]
*  take them to lunch afterwards, have a party after work. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=558.48s)]
*  After every you've taken the office to go vote. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=561.76s)]
*  We have work to do in these 48 hours. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  But having said that, I am I'm very optimistic and hopeful. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=566.72s)]
*  And frankly, I know people watching this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  Mike, how can you say that? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=573.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  We have all these crazy people and all the Trumpsters and Magna Nation. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=576.08s)]
*  And what I say to them is, honestly, I have a lot of personal deep faith in my fellow Americans. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=580.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely the right thing. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=589.6s)]
*  It's a very important sentiment. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=592.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people are definitely counting on the goodness of Americans to see this through. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=593.2s)]
*  Let me just talk about your state, Michigan, for a moment. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=598.08s)]
*  I want to talk about the last time you joined us back in July when Biden was still running. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=600.32s)]
*  You had this to say about his support for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=605.44s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  That that he would decide to hug Netanyahu to go there and tell him, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=612.88s)]
*  as the tape you just showed in November, just people wanting to cease fire. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=619.0400000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=623.12s)]
*  No, he goes, no. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=624.24s)]
*  This has, I think, really rattled people in my state. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=627.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  So that was back in July. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=633.5200000000001s)]
*  Give me a sense of what you anticipate happening in Michigan on Tuesday. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=634.56s)]
*  Well, when Biden was running there in the early summer, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=639.76s)]
*  support for Biden Harris, which was at 70 percent four years ago, they got 70 percent of the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=644.8s)]
*  Michigan Arab Muslim vote, was down to 12 percent because of Biden endorsing, embracing, and enabling [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  the slaughter of tens of thousands of civilians. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=659.76s)]
*  I don't know anybody watching this with your Irish, with whatever group you're part of. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=662.64s)]
*  If you were Jewish, if you were, I mean, just pick the group, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=669.68s)]
*  and your tax dollars were going to kill the cousins, the relatives, the friends, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=673.28s)]
*  the neighbors of where you came from. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  What do you think the people of Detroit and Dearborn are going to do with that? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=682.48s)]
*  Well, the good news is Biden stepped aside, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=686.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris came in, and that 12 percent support of Biden Harris jumped to over 43 percent. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=689.76s)]
*  That's good news, but it's still quite a bit behind the 70 percent they had four years ago. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=697.76s)]
*  So we're estimating in Michigan, possibly, we need 40,000 votes of the 40,000 Arab and Muslim [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=704.16s)]
*  Americans who are, they're not going to vote for Trump. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=711.44s)]
*  I mean, he has, he already had one third of the vote. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=713.84s)]
*  He'll get one third of it this time, not that anymore. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNLUccZ25Io&t=716.24s)]
