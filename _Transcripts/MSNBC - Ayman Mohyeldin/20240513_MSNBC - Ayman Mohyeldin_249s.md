# Could U.S. climate policy be up for sale under a second Trump presidency?
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA)
*  I made a pledge to your state that you have the highest energy costs in the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=0.0s)]
*  In the first year, they're going to be reduced by 50 percent because we are going to drill, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  baby drill, drill, baby drill. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=15.6s)]
*  That was Donald Trump in January, fresh off of a win at the New Hampshire primary, bragging [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  about dismantling President Biden's green agenda if he wins a second term in November. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=25.86s)]
*  And now we're learning his positions on climate policy are on sale to the highest bidder. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=31.18s)]
*  A stunning new report by the Washington Post details a meeting at Mar-a-Lago last month [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=37.06s)]
*  between Donald Trump and about two dozen top oil executives. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=42.06s)]
*  And during a dinner, one executive complained that they had spent $400 million lobbying [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=45.5s)]
*  the Biden administration and had nothing to show for it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=49.94s)]
*  The president had still not changed his position on some pretty inconvenient environmental [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=53.98s)]
*  regulations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=58.66s)]
*  And that's when Donald Trump reportedly shocked some people in the room, saying, you all are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  wealthy enough that you should raise $1 billion to return me to the White House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=64.94s)]
*  Trump reportedly claimed $1 billion would be a deal because of how much he'd limit taxes [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  and regulation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=75.36s)]
*  The ex-president vowed to immediately end the Biden administration's freeze on permits [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=76.72s)]
*  for new liquefied natural gas exports, a top priority for executives, according to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=81.38s)]
*  three people present. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=86.02s)]
*  Now, Trump said, quote, you'll get it on the first day, an attendee recalled. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=87.3s)]
*  He also said that he would start auctioning off more leases for oil drilling in the Gulf [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=91.74s)]
*  of Mexico, railed against wind and wind power, and committed to reversing restrictions on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=96.14s)]
*  drilling in the Alaskan Arctic. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=102.78s)]
*  NBC News has not yet independently verified this reporting, but this is a Donald Trump [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=104.46s)]
*  that we are all very familiar with, a dealmaker, a showman, and a climate change denier who [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=109.26s)]
*  claimed it is a hoax concocted by China. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=114.68s)]
*  He's a presidential candidate desperate for cash due to a mountain of legal fees, and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=118.7s)]
*  he is spending precious time that he could use to fundraise inside a Manhattan courthouse. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  But there is something more sinister at play here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  This is a potential two-term president reportedly putting global survivability on the line to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=132.44s)]
*  enrich himself. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=138.18s)]
*  Beyond the deep and potentially irreversible implications for our climate and our planet, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump's comments also signal a disturbing obliteration of norms and laws surrounding [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  lobbying. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=150.18s)]
*  As Zeeshan Aleem writes for MSNBC.com, if Trump said he believes regulations are bad [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=151.18s)]
*  and renewable energy is overhyped, and that he hoped those who agreed would donate to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=157.62s)]
*  his campaign, then he'd be operating within the normal parameters of courting donors. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=161.94s)]
*  But the Washington Post's report actually suggests that he flipped around the ask, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=167.9s)]
*  proposing instead that a specific amount of money could ensure that he would take specific [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=173.38s)]
*  action. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=178.74s)]
*  It's a glaring, undeniable flaunting of Trump's corruption, and no need to split hairs here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=179.74s)]
*  Take this as a reminder and a warning. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=186.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's claims that he is a political outsider are nothing more than a sham. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=187.94s)]
*  He said he is different, that he is not like the establishment politicians he's constantly [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=193.56s)]
*  slammed over the years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=198.78s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  He's actually way more brazen than any other politician we have seen in this country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  If Trump is willing to take on an approach that we have seen from dictators overseas, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=206.32s)]
*  bringing wealthy people into his room and orbit and asking them directly for what they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=210.88s)]
*  want, what's to stop him from using the very same playbook with foreign powers like Saudi [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=215.84s)]
*  Arabia or Russia? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=221.48s)]
*  Under second Donald Trump presidency, is America for sale? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmNCC2-NrA&t=223.76s)]
