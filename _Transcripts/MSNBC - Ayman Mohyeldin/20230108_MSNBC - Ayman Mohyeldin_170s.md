Video Description: Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has re-opened her investigation into fake electors who claim former President Trump won the state in the 2020 election. She said the evidence presented by the Jan. 6 committee was what compelled her to re-open the case, saying, “why wouldn’t we charge under state law when we have evidence to do so.”

# Michigan AG Nessel re-opens case into Trump fake electors in state
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [January 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM)
*  Let me ask you about your state for a moment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=0.0s)]
*  On Friday, you reopened an investigation into the 16 Republican electors who falsely claimed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  that Donald Trump won Michigan in the 2020 election, citing new evidence released by [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=10.06s)]
*  the January 6 committee. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=14.92s)]
*  Michigan GOP co-chair Michonne Maddock has already basically outlined their plot to submit [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=18.02s)]
*  these alternate electors. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=23.32s)]
*  What was your reaction to that and talk to us about how you came to the decision to reopen [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=26.3s)]
*  this investigation? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=31.46s)]
*  What was specifically the new evidence that compelled you to do so? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=32.46s)]
*  Well, look, there has been a mountain of evidence in this case, honestly, since the very beginning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=36.3s)]
*  We referred it, along with many other state AGs and swing states, to the federal authorities [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=43.24s)]
*  and the Department of Justice, I assume, is continuing to investigate. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  But we're really at a point where it's hard to make sense of why, with this evidence that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=54.699999999999996s)]
*  we see each and every day and that has been presented by the January 6 committee, why [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=64.3s)]
*  we wouldn't charge under state law when we have the evidence to do so. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=70.22s)]
*  And the law supports those charges. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=75.94s)]
*  And obviously, the federal authorities, I'm certain, will continue to move forward. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=79.38s)]
*  But the way I see it is, here in the state of Michigan, it's a 14-year felony to pass [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=85.46s)]
*  a bad check. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  Every day in my department, we issue charges of welfare fraud and unemployment insurance [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=93.3s)]
*  fraud for things that are so relatively minor compared to the offense of attempting to use [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  a document to overturn a presidential election where over 5.5 million people voted in our [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=108.04s)]
*  state. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  And it's really hard for me to explain to my constituents, and it's hard for me to reconcile [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  personally why it is that if you have enough money and influence and power, that you can [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=120.92s)]
*  get away with just about any crime. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think that that's a good policy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=130.8s)]
*  And I don't think it's what the people who elected me to office want to see. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=134.32s)]
*  And that's why I think it's time to move forward on this matter and to resume our investigation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i-XaQvljZM&t=138.64000000000001s)]
