Video Description: The Republican Party used to pride itself on being a “big tent” party. They wanted as many people as possible to come together under the guiding principles of small government, free trade and personal responsibility. To be a Republican now, there’s only one requirement: complete and total subservience to Donald Trump. Former RNC Chairman Michael Steele shares his thoughts on the party’s shrinking tent and speaks with his panelists about the future of the GOP.

# Whatever Happened To The Republicans Being The “Big Tent” Party?
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0)
*  The Republican Party used to pride itself on being a big tent party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=0.0s)]
*  We wanted as many people as possible to come together under the guiding principles of small [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=5.28s)]
*  government, free trade, and personal responsibility. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=9.6s)]
*  At least that's how it was when I was running the Republican National Committee. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=13.3s)]
*  OGs like myself have watched it transform from a big tent to a little tent to now no [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=17.2s)]
*  tent at all. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=22.6s)]
*  Now there's only one thing required to enter modern Republican politics, complete and total [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=24.2s)]
*  subservience to Donald Trump. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=30.4s)]
*  How else should we interpret House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's endorsement of Trump-backed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=32.6s)]
*  primary challenger running for Liz Cheney's congressional seat? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=38.46s)]
*  Cheney apparently sealed her anti-GOP fate after condemning Trump in the wake of the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=42.76s)]
*  Capitol insurrection and participating in the January 6th Committee. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=47.92s)]
*  According to Politico, Trump's even pushing for changes to Wyoming's election laws so [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=52.6s)]
*  that Democrats and independents, the two people likely to support Cheney for standing up to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Trump, they can't vote for her in the upcoming GOP primary. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=65.12s)]
*  This is all infelty to Trump, at his behest. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=69.8s)]
*  But don't let Kevin McCarthy off the hook, folks. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=73.72s)]
*  He's abandoning a former member of the House Republican leadership here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=76.44s)]
*  That's because Trump wanted him to. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=80.64s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=82.56s)]
*  And of course, that's why the GOP is the no-tent party. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=83.56s)]
*  They're not about policy debates or discussing the role of government anymore. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=87.4s)]
*  They're just about Trump. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=92.32s)]
*  Another case in point, South Carolina, where Republican Nancy Mace is in the immediate [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=94.52s)]
*  aftermath of the insurrection, Congresswoman Mace has said Trump had no future in the party. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=101.72s)]
*  Since then, she's tried to make herself Trumpier to get back into his good graces. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=108.12s)]
*  But it hasn't worked. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  And now she's facing a tough primary challenge from a Trump-backed candidate, which led her [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=114.92s)]
*  to post this embarrassing video online a couple of weeks ago. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=120.4s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman Nancy Mace here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  I'm in front of Trump Tower today. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  And I remember in 2015 when President Trump announced his run. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=128.08s)]
*  I was one of his earliest supporters. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=129.08s)]
*  I supported him. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=130.08s)]
*  I was a big fan of him. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=131.08s)]
*  I was a big fan of him. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=132.08s)]
*  I was a big fan of him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=133.08s)]
*  I was a big fan of him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=134.08s)]
*  I was a big fan of him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=135.08s)]
*  I was a big fan of him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=136.08s)]
*  I was a big fan of him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=137.08s)]
*  I was a big fan of him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  Again, in 2020 because of policies I believed in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  The lesson here for Congresswoman Mace and everyone else with an R after their name, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=143.36s)]
*  Trump will make you grovel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=147.96s)]
*  He will make you beg, but he'll never forgive you. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=149.56s)]
*  And the rest of us will be left wondering if you, much like the party of which you're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=153.24s)]
*  a member, stand for anything. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=157.52s)]
*  Or if you're just standing in the middle of an empty field where there used to be a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=159.72000000000003s)]
*  big tent. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  So much to discuss. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=165.88s)]
*  I haven't even gotten to the battle between Kevin McCarthy and Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=166.88s)]
*  That's some hot-ish. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  Joining me now is MSNBC political analyst David Jolly. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  He's a former Republican congressman from Florida and the national chairman of the Serve [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=177.6s)]
*  America movement. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=183.16s)]
*  Kurt Bardella. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=184.56s)]
*  He's an advisor to the DNC and DCCC as well as a former spokesman for the House Oversight [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=185.56s)]
*  Committee. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=191.14s)]
*  And oh yes, here she is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=192.14s)]
*  Stephanie Miller, host of the Stephanie Miller Show on Sirius XM. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=194.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, we got the group at our house tonight. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=198.56s)]
*  So we're going to start with David. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=202.6s)]
*  David, the State of the Union address is coming up in a little over a week and you know how [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=204.36s)]
*  that goes and you know what that means. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=210.34s)]
*  What do you think the State of the Union for the Republican Party is right now? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=213.94s)]
*  Well, look, politically speaking, it's a fairly easy spot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=219.0s)]
*  They're in the opposition, so they just get to oppose and suggest that the world would [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=223.36s)]
*  be better under their leadership. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=227.36s)]
*  I think Democrats face some real challenges. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, we saw in Virginia that even though Democrats have worked hard on some of their [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=231.8s)]
*  top priorities, they're on the right side of history when it comes to voting rights [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  with accountability for January 6th. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=239.44000000000003s)]
*  The voters are still in a different place than where perhaps the Democrats might be [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  exactly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=245.8s)]
*  They're focused on inflation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=246.8s)]
*  They're focused on the pandemic and all the regulations around that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=247.8s)]
*  So it will be interesting to see how Biden frames the night because then it's a layup [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=251.8s)]
*  for Republicans. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=256.72s)]
*  They're just going to oppose it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=257.72s)]
*  As you said in your opener, this is no longer a party about real ideas. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=258.72s)]
*  This is a party about following the personality of one man and where that falls short, it's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=262.44s)]
*  peddling grievance and culture wars to anger an already angry base. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=267.12s)]
*  So Kurt, I want to get your reaction to Kevin McCarthy backing a primary challenger to Liz [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=272.0s)]
*  Cheney, someone who used to be a prominent member of the GOP leadership. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=276.48s)]
*  Her conservative bona fides are well established given her family's pedigree in Republican [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=280.64s)]
*  politics. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=285.52s)]
*  All of this pushing Liz aside is to keep that base happy by McCarthy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=287.08s)]
*  Is that just the height of cowardice from the minority leader or is there more going [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  on here? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=297.32s)]
*  Well, I think it signals, Michael, that really now we have a party that if you could have [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=298.32s)]
*  the perfect conservative voting record, which Liz Cheney pretty much has, and that's not [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  good enough to get the support of your own leadership. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=310.0s)]
*  That's how far gone the Republican party is. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=313.72s)]
*  I can't imagine, I'm sure nor can you, someone like John Boehner doing this to someone in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=315.28s)]
*  his own conference back in the days when you were chairman of the party and I was a Republican [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=319.56s)]
*  working on Capitol Hill for Republicans. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=323.76s)]
*  Watching Kevin McCarthy send out the signal that no longer is your voting record the number [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=326.8s)]
*  one thing that's going to determine whether he supports you or not. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=332.92s)]
*  It's whether or not you just pledge unyielding fealty to Donald Trump and whether or not [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=335.56s)]
*  you still go along with the big lie, whether you excuse an act of domestic terrorism on [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=339.88s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=344.84s)]
*  Liz Cheney's only crime here in the Republican party is that she wants to get to the truth [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=345.84s)]
*  of what happened on January 6th. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=349.8s)]
*  That's enough for Kevin McCarthy and the Republican conference to say we're not going to get behind [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=352.48s)]
*  you, we're not going to stand with you, we're going to break a tremendous amount of precedent [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  here and interfere in a primary and go against you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=360.28s)]
*  That's how far this party's gone. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=364.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know, that's a very important point that Kurt makes, Stephanie, about leadership. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=365.8s)]
*  And given all that's happening in D.C., it's enough to make you wonder who's really running [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=371.8s)]
*  the party, who is the leadership. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=376.8s)]
*  So at an American first rally in Texas last night, Marjorie Taylor Greene bragged about [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=378.72s)]
*  her efforts at holding up Congress. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=383.48s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=386.0s)]
*  So Steny Hoyer, you know, he's the leader over there in the majority party and he'd [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=389.0s)]
*  be stomping over to Kevin McCarthy's office. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=392.88s)]
*  What are you going to do about her, Kevin? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  Well let me tell you, Kevin can't do anything about me. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=401.2s)]
*  So you know, Kevin may have the title of minority leader, but Marjorie Taylor Greene's got the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=408.56s)]
*  title of, hey, I'm running this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=415.04s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=418.8s)]
*  It's, your party has become pathetic, Michael. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=419.88s)]
*  I, as you know, my dad was chairman of the Republican Party. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes he was. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=427.48s)]
*  Yes he was. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=428.48s)]
*  I have daddy issues with you to start, but I would like to get back to a place where [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=429.48s)]
*  we all can fight about real issues, where I wouldn't want to hang out with any of all [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=434.16s)]
*  y'alls because you're all Republicans. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=438.16s)]
*  But you know, Michael, you told me on my radio show, when we get back to that day, you said, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  I am the scorpion that's going to sting you when we get to the other side of the river. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=446.52s)]
*  But I think we all just want to get to the other side of the river where we're talking [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=452.0s)]
*  about real issues and not like, not to name drop another chairman, but you know, Jamie [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  Harrison was just on my show on Friday and said the Republican Party has become the party [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=460.08s)]
*  of fear, fraud and fascism. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  And prove him wrong. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=467.44s)]
*  Prove him wrong based on what is going on right now. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=469.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't think it's a party my dad would recognize. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure you don't. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=475.12s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=476.12s)]
*  And that's what's so powerful actually about that clip from someone like Margie Taylor [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=478.32s)]
*  Greene, particularly given that she's a member of Congress sitting without any responsibility. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  She just shows up in Rex Havit. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=487.32s)]
*  And that's a sad thing, David. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=489.36s)]
*  I mean, all of this positioning for McCarthy to stay in the good graces of the Freedom [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=490.68s)]
*  Caucus might not even work out for him. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=494.52s)]
*  I mean, if you stop and look at it, if the Republicans take back the House in the midterms, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=497.2s)]
*  the Freedom Caucus is likely going to try to install someone other than McCarthy as [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=501.84s)]
*  the new speaker, someone like Jim Jordan or Matt Gaetz. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=506.96s)]
*  Who's going to win that power struggle? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=511.88s)]
*  How do you see that playing out? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=514.36s)]
*  No, Michael, you hit the nail on the head. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=515.88s)]
*  It also explains McCarthy's endorsement in Wyoming. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=518.1999999999999s)]
*  Look, this is a weak-kneed coward who is currently in the position of minority leader. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=520.92s)]
*  He is desperate, desperate to be Speaker of the House. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=525.4s)]
*  He would give part of his anatomy to be Speaker of the House. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=527.9599999999999s)]
*  Recall that in 17 or 18, when Boehner was ousted, McCarthy thought he had the votes. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  He actually lost the votes within his own conference, could not become Speaker. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=536.0s)]
*  So he has done everything he could. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=540.36s)]
*  He wakes up every day trying to figure out how to be Speaker. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=542.12s)]
*  And what that means in an evenly divided House like we have right now, you see him endorse [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=545.16s)]
*  people like Green and Gaetz and all the crazies, or at least embrace them, because he needs [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=550.36s)]
*  every vote he can get. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  He thanks Cheney's going down, so he's going to endorse her opponent. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=556.9s)]
*  Watch what happened. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=560.36s)]
*  If the House stays tight, he won't have the votes to be Speaker of the House because of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=561.72s)]
*  Green and Gaetz and others. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=565.88s)]
*  More importantly, and this is perfect Kevin McCarthy, if Republicans pick up 40, 50, 60 seats, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=567.32s)]
*  he'll throw all the crazies to the side because he won't need them anymore. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=573.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=577.08s)]
*  And he'll suggest he's the responsible Republican leader now. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=577.1600000000001s)]
*  That is such an excellent point. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=580.76s)]
*  It is such a McCarthy move. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=582.6s)]
*  And I think that's something that a lot of the Freedom Caucus folks recognize and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=585.0s)]
*  why they feel the way they do. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=589.88s)]
*  So, Kurt, when you've got Congresswoman Mace, for example, standing out there eating crow [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=591.8s)]
*  ever since she bent the knee to Trump outside of Trump Tower, some elected Republicans who [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=597.3199999999999s)]
*  have crossed Trump are opting to throw in the towel instead. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=601.8s)]
*  Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Ohio, Congressman Anthony Gonzalez and New York [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=606.04s)]
*  Congressman John Katko all voted to impeach Trump after January 6th and have now announced [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=611.0s)]
*  they'll retire rather than stay in Congress. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=616.36s)]
*  How dangerous is that for the party? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=618.84s)]
*  In particular, in light of what was just said about the possible pickups of seats, they're [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=621.88s)]
*  also having to figure out how to hold some seats as well. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=629.0s)]
*  True? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=632.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=634.84s)]
*  And I think one of the things that's happening here is this lurch to the right, to this embrace [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=635.08s)]
*  of extremism and fascism and authoritarianism that the Republican Party is awash in right now [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=639.72s)]
*  has pushed out some moderate establishment type voices. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=645.0s)]
*  I mean, this isn't a party anymore that welcomes a Michael Steele or a David Jolly. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=648.52s)]
*  They see you guys as the enemy even more so at times than Democrats. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=653.24s)]
*  We look at how the far right propaganda outlets cover the Republican Party. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=656.92s)]
*  They make people like you guys who speak common sense and believe in traditional [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=661.08s)]
*  conservative values. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=666.04s)]
*  They see you as a greater enemy than Joe Biden or the Democratic Party. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=667.08s)]
*  That is why there's, in my opinion, there's no return to normalcy for this Republican Party. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=671.4s)]
*  That's why for me personally, why I joined the Democratic Party back in 2016 and why [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=677.08s)]
*  I still cling to the hope that people like you and David will come over and join us too [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=681.96s)]
*  sometimes. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=686.52s)]
*  We are the big tent party, Mike. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=687.0s)]
*  We got some issues to work out first though. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=689.8s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=692.28s)]
*  That's going to be a hell of a negotiation. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=695.24s)]
*  Michael, only in Washington is half a tent considered big. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=697.32s)]
*  That's true of both sides of the aisle. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=702.12s)]
*  Just because you have moderates doesn't make you a big tent. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=703.72s)]
*  I know. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=706.36s)]
*  You got some issue on that side. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=708.2s)]
*  You got to work out first, Kurt. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=709.5600000000001s)]
*  So Stephanie, to Kurt's point, it raises some very interesting posts as we go forward. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=711.88s)]
*  We look at, for example, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other Republican presidential [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  hopefuls trying to split the difference between their own ambitions and showing proper [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=723.0s)]
*  deference to Donald Trump. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=727.3199999999999s)]
*  How do you see that playing out? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=728.76s)]
*  We, you know, everybody's kind of hanging their hat on the race in Virginia. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=729.88s)]
*  That's the path forward. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=734.12s)]
*  I'm like, folks, trust me, that's an aberration because the primary there was very different. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=735.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's pathetic. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=742.12s)]
*  I mean, I don't know where this goes, particularly if Trump's in jail by then. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=743.9599999999999s)]
*  That's going to be particularly funny. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=747.48s)]
*  But, you know, Nancy Mace and these people that are, you know, spoke the truth and now [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=749.24s)]
*  they're sucking up to him in front of Trump Tower. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=753.88s)]
*  I mean, what's your next commercial with a ballgag and like the GIMP's basement and [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=756.04s)]
*  Pulp Fiction, like begging forgiveness? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=759.8s)]
*  I mean, it's pathetic. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbgiiIjfaz0&t=762.12s)]
