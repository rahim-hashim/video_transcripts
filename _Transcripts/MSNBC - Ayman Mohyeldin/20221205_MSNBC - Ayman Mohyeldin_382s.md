# Mallory McMorrow’s Rise To Stardom In The Democratic Party
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=0.0s)]
*  My next guest helped Michigan Democrats win control of the state Senate for the first [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=3.58s)]
*  time in nearly 40 years, and she wants to make sure Michigan is a key player in the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  2024 elections. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=11.5s)]
*  I am joined now by Mallory McMorrow, Michigan state senator. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=12.5s)]
*  State senator, it's great to have you again. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=16.82s)]
*  Thanks for coming back on the show. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=18.22s)]
*  Let me start by talking to you about this gridiron speech. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=19.82s)]
*  First of all, how did it come about? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=22.02s)]
*  There's no way I delivered it as well as you did, but tell us about how it came about, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=24.7s)]
*  and were you surprised to get asked? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=28.64s)]
*  I was really surprised. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=31.64s)]
*  Al Hunt, who is a longtime member of the gridiron club, I did a podcast with him and James Carville [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=33.56s)]
*  months ago, and then out of the blue, we got an invitation in my email inbox, and one of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  my staff members asked what this was and if it was a big deal, and I said, yeah, it is. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=45.08s)]
*  And we were thrilled to do it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=52.08s)]
*  It's a good thing you didn't flag it as spam, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=53.08s)]
*  Yeah, really. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=55.92s)]
*  So the gridiron dinner, joking aside, is really just one data point, really, in your [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=58.48s)]
*  rise in democratic politics. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we've had you on the show before. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=64.22s)]
*  We've been following you very closely. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=66.14s)]
*  You've raised more than $2 million this year. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=68.38s)]
*  Talk about what you hope to do with that power and influence that you have accumulated. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=71.02s)]
*  Let's talk about that first on a state level and then what it means for your party regaining [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=76.62s)]
*  control in the state Senate for the first time in 40 years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=81.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=84.02s)]
*  I mean, the gridiron is a perfect example of everything we've tried to do with kind [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=85.08s)]
*  of this viral moment that I had back in April that I never asked for, but recognizing that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  we could use this microphone in this moment to do something really powerful. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  So it has been a continued point of mine to get the message out about how important state [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=97.96s)]
*  legislatures really are. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=104.32s)]
*  We saw what happened with Dobbs and the fall of Roe. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=105.72s)]
*  We've seen what has happened for decades with gerrymandering, the fact that Republicans [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=108.44s)]
*  took over two thirds of state legislatures and gerrymandered the maps to continue to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=113.04s)]
*  take control. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=118.34s)]
*  So this was an opportunity to bring the attention down to where all of this work actually happens [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  and do something huge. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=125.0s)]
*  It was a long time coming, but in Michigan, we flipped the entire legislature blue for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=126.5s)]
*  the first time in nearly 40 years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=131.26s)]
*  So going into 2024, when we've got divided Congress on the federal level now, and there's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=133.9s)]
*  likely less that's going to get done. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy already announcing he's going to read the Constitution and hold investigations [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=141.82s)]
*  on Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=146.2s)]
*  But you look at a state like Michigan and with a Democratic governor and a Democratic [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=147.72s)]
*  legislature, we are going to be the ones who are out there proving what it looks like when [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=152.4s)]
*  Democrats are in charge. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  And with Michigan now on the map as an early primary state, we are going to be the ones [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  proving it out. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  And I'm really excited about that opportunity for all of us. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=163.6s)]
*  Yeah, talk to me a little bit about that specifically. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=166.04s)]
*  I mean, you've said you want to make Michigan a key player in 2024. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=168.22s)]
*  As you mentioned, it is possibly in the early primary states if that does get approved by [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=171.82000000000002s)]
*  the full DNC membership. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=175.82000000000002s)]
*  What do you have in mind for Michigan now that it is fully controlled by Democrats? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=177.94s)]
*  What do you want to see done? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  We have to put into place everything that is building up for the past four decades. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=185.72000000000003s)]
*  So right off the bat, Michiganders voted overwhelmingly to codify Roe to protect reproductive rights. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  So we have to get our abortion ban off the books and send a message to voters that we [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=196.58s)]
*  hear you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=201.02s)]
*  We have to amend our state civil rights act to explicitly include the LGBTQ community. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=202.02s)]
*  And we've seen just in the past few weeks the rising rhetoric and the attack on the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=206.7s)]
*  LGBTQ community. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=210.9s)]
*  And then we've got to do economic issues. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=211.9s)]
*  We've got to address school funding. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=213.94s)]
*  We have to address economic development that is about supporting small businesses, businesses [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=215.36s)]
*  of color, and proving that when Democrats are in charge, we create opportunity for everybody, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=219.7s)]
*  especially in a state like Michigan. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=225.04s)]
*  Speaking of the economy, this past week you had President Biden in Michigan talking about [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=226.84s)]
*  domestic manufacturing and semiconductors. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Talk to me about what it means to have the president come back to your state and these [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=233.92s)]
*  important issues for Michiganders. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  Is the economy going to be front and center now that the legislator is in Democratic hands [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=240.48s)]
*  with a Democratic governor? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=246.0s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=248.44s)]
*  It goes back to the old adage, it's the economy, stupid. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=249.44s)]
*  And it always is. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=252.44s)]
*  Michigan is the home of the Great Lakes and the American automotive industry. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=253.9s)]
*  We are both. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=258.3s)]
*  It is about protecting clean water. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=259.3s)]
*  It's about transitioning into the future of manufacturing electric vehicles, autonomous [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=260.54s)]
*  vehicles, doing more of this manufacturing at home, and making sure that these are good [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=265.98s)]
*  union jobs, that these are jobs that are not just minimum wage jobs, that they're careers, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  that we are fulfilling the American dream in the way that Michigan always has. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=275.46s)]
*  It was really exciting to see him here again and to be part of that transition into the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=280.76s)]
*  future where Michigan, again, as we're looking for where things are getting done for the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=285.32s)]
*  next two years, it's going to be in a state like ours so that we can show what's going [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=289.44s)]
*  to happen and why we should be able to take the Congress back as well as re-electing a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=294.44s)]
*  Democratic president in 2024. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  I have to ask you a personal question if I can. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=300.44s)]
*  Have you thought with all of this spotlight and now the national attention on you about [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=303.8s)]
*  your own future and how you can build on what you have done inside Michigan perhaps [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=307.48s)]
*  at a more national level? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=311.82s)]
*  Have you given that any thought since we made the comparison to Barack Obama being the last [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=314.38s)]
*  state senator to address the gridiron? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=318.42s)]
*  I mean, look, I just got re-elected for another four years with about 79% of the vote, which [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=320.94s)]
*  I'm really excited about. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=326.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm grateful to all of my voters for putting their faith in me again. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=328.62s)]
*  And this is an opportunity we haven't had in Michigan in my entire lifetime. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=333.38s)]
*  I'm somebody who fundamentally believes if we can do the work at home and we can prove [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=337.12s)]
*  it out, then my future is pretty wide open. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=341.96s)]
*  But I'm focused here where it matters the most. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=344.28s)]
*  And you have a wide open invitation to come back at any time on this show. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=346.44s)]
*  Michigan State Senator Mallory McMorrow, thank you so much. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=350.2s)]
*  As always, I greatly appreciate your time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Amon. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RJ0r68YoVw&t=355.35999999999996s)]
