# The GOP’s shameless double standard on display with their Hunter Biden obsession
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA)
*  For my friends, everything. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=0.0s)]
*  For my enemies, the law. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=5.32s)]
*  That quote, often attributed to various Latin American dictators, now seems to encapsulate [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=7.5s)]
*  the modern-day Republican Party's approach to justice. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=12.56s)]
*  You see, for the GOP, it is not just bad when people aren't punished for violating the law. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=16.04s)]
*  It's also bad when members of their own party are punished. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=20.64s)]
*  To put, Republicans want the justice system applied differently depending on the target. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=25.76s)]
*  Look no further than their reaction to the Hunter-Biden plea deal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=30.76s)]
*  Since that agreement was announced, Republicans have been tripping over themselves, rushing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  to the nearest TV news camera to scream unironically that the Biden DOJ has a double standard when [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  it comes to justice. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=44.92s)]
*  In fact, just this week, the Republican chairs of three, not one, not two, but three major [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=45.92s)]
*  a joint statement blasting what they call the quote, two-tiered system of justice applied [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=52.8s)]
*  to the Hunter-Biden investigation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=58.4s)]
*  And that is despite statements from both the attorney general, Merrick Garland, and the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=60.76s)]
*  Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in charge of the case denying any improprieties with either [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=65.28s)]
*  the probe or the plea deal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=71.24s)]
*  Conservatives said the agreement in which Hunter-Biden agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=74.08s)]
*  tax charges and will avoid full prosecution on a separate gun charge reeks of preferential [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=78.2s)]
*  treatment. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  But let's put aside their words and conspiratorial thinking for a second and actually look at [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  the facts of the Hunter-Biden case. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=90.16s)]
*  Legal experts tell NBC News that the kind of tax charges brought against Hunter-Biden [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=92.68s)]
*  are rarely, rarely brought against first-time offenders and even more rarely result in jail [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=97.08s)]
*  time. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=103.72s)]
*  Former FBI general counsel and friend of the show, Andrew Weissman, put it, quote, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=104.72s)]
*  this is, if anything, harsh, not lenient. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=109.0s)]
*  And this deal, which was agreed upon by Hunter-Biden's lawyers and again, Trump-appointed U.S. attorney [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=114.24s)]
*  who has been investigating him for the last five years, will need the final sign-off from [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=120.88s)]
*  a Trump-appointed judge next month. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, that doesn't sound like the vast Democratic conspiracy Republicans have made this out [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=130.48s)]
*  to be. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=135.88s)]
*  And despite this, Donald Trump says the agreement is the equivalent of a, quote, traffic ticket, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=137.28s)]
*  and he now believes the justice system is, quote, corrupt. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=142.28s)]
*  But the truth is, Trump's lawyers tried to get him to take a plea deal and he rejected [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=147.04s)]
*  their efforts, according to The Washington Post. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=151.5s)]
*  So he could have had more favorable treatment like Hunter-Biden. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=154.28s)]
*  But instead, according to the indictment against him, he obstructed officials at nearly every [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=158.2s)]
*  term. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=163.28s)]
*  And if you want to talk about the so-called two tiers of justice, what about this new [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=164.83999999999997s)]
*  reporting? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  According to The Washington Post, the Justice Department slow-walked its probe into Trump's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  involvement in January 6th for more than a year out of fear of appearing partisan. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=175.5s)]
*  Does that sound like something a Justice Department under President Trump or even a hypothetical [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=181.88s)]
*  Ron DeSantis would do? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=186.36s)]
*  Be cautious and thoughtful and do everything by the book slowly? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  So with those facts in mind, let's get to the bottom of what the GOP is really doing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=194.3s)]
*  here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  They are using Hunter-Biden as a distraction, hoping you don't remember that their guy, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  the front-runner of the Republican Party in the nomination, is currently in way more dangerous [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=204.68s)]
*  and consequential legal trouble. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=210.08s)]
*  In fact, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer just vowed to continue his Hunter-Biden [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=212.55999999999997s)]
*  distraction campaign and push forward with his panel's month-long probe into the president's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=216.83999999999997s)]
*  sons, promising the DOJ's deal would have, quote, no impact on his investigation. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=222.16s)]
*  And as we have made clear on this show many times before, if the evidence pointed to wrongdoing, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  we would acknowledge it and understand the need for an investigation into the Bidens. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=234.16s)]
*  We would demand it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  But so far, Comer has found zero actual evidence that anyone in President Biden's family was [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=240.4s)]
*  peddling influence or engaging in business schemes like he has alleged. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  All innuendo. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  All talk. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=252.96s)]
*  Nothing more. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=254.52s)]
*  It is the same tactic Republicans have used for years to discredit the Russia investigation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=255.52s)]
*  And this month, in what Republicans hoped would be a public relations win, the House [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=261.24s)]
*  Judiciary Committee invited former special counsel John Durham to testify for more than [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=266.26s)]
*  five hours about his report on the FBI investigation regarding collusion between Russian officials [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=270.98s)]
*  and Trump's 2016 campaign. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=277.58s)]
*  Let me be very clear for you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=280.5s)]
*  Republicans could only hope for a public relations win because, just like James Comer with Hunter [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=283.02s)]
*  Biden, John Durham failed to provide evidence that the government had acted maliciously [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=288.14s)]
*  in the Russia investigation against Trump or his campaign. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=294.38000000000005s)]
*  Over the course of the entire four-year probe, Durham got one guilty plea from a low-level [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=298.38000000000005s)]
*  FBI lawyer on a minor charge. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=306.5s)]
*  Not exactly a massive, deep state conspiracy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=310.82000000000005s)]
*  It's certainly not the weaponization of the justice system that Republicans kept banging [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=314.42s)]
*  on about and a point that Democrats made clear during that hearing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=319.94s)]
*  And with all these resources and all these people you were sent to help you investigate [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=325.86s)]
*  the investigators, you only filed three criminal cases. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=329.9s)]
*  You only brought two cases to trial, correct? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=333.98s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=336.78s)]
*  And you lost all the cases you brought to trial, correct? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=337.78s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=340.62s)]
*  Touting those stolen documents on the campaign trail over a hundred times? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=341.62s)]
*  I said I don't really read the newspapers or listen to the news. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=346.54s)]
*  I don't find all that reliable, so I don't know that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=349.82s)]
*  Mr. Durham, you're totally oblivious to Donald Trump's use of the stolen emails on the campaign [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=352.14s)]
*  trail more than a hundred times? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=356.5s)]
*  I'm not aware of that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=358.3s)]
*  You can hold yourself out as an objective Department of Justice official or as a partisan [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=360.46s)]
*  hack and the more that you try to spin the facts and not answer my questions, you sound [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=365.26s)]
*  like the latter. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=369.58s)]
*  Republicans have refused to accept the truth about the Russia investigation. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=372.82s)]
*  And now they're refusing to accept the truth about the charges against Hunter Biden. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=375.86s)]
*  As MSNBC's Jahan Jones notes, with both Hunter Biden and Durham, the Republicans had dreams [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  of the DOJ being an attack dog against their political enemies. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  And both dreams have gone up in flames. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=389.26s)]
*  And when their dreams go up in flames, the GOP gets more desperate. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=392.22s)]
*  They are not going to back down or stop making baseless accusations about Hunter Biden or [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  the Russia investigation. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  And they are taking the same tactic with the investigations facing Donald Trump. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=401.5s)]
*  The MAGA Keystone cops of the GOP are so desperate to protect Trump and shift the media focus [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=406.7s)]
*  that they're planning bogus impeachment proceedings against President Biden. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=412.58s)]
*  Yes, you heard that correctly. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=416.29999999999995s)]
*  Impeachment proceedings against President Biden and his cabinet officials and are continuing [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  to spread debunked and baseless conspiracies, all while hypocritically and shamelessly defending [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=422.97999999999996s)]
*  Trump at every turn. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=430.1s)]
*  James Comer, Jim Jordan, other MAGA Republicans, they have made clear that their focus is to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=432.18s)]
*  hurt President Biden in an attempt to get Trump back into the White House. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=437.14s)]
*  So I want to warn you, they are not going to stop, no matter how little evidence they [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=441.54s)]
*  find, no matter how unbelievable the conspiracy theories become, these conspiracy theories [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=445.94s)]
*  are. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=452.14s)]
*  And it's up to all of us to call it out and set the record straight every chance we get. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQXbwyzPUwA&t=453.5s)]
