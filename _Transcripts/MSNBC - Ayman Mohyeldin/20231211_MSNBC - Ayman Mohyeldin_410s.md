# How Taylor Swift sent the far right into a tailspin
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ)
*  This week, Taylor Swift was named Times 2023 Person of the Year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And for those of us normal people on Earth One, a megastar with a billion dollars in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=8.16s)]
*  ticket sales for a single tour, could be given this title for the impact she has had. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  But on Earth Two, right-wing commentator Jack Pasovitch said, quote, the Taylor Swift girl [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=17.68s)]
*  boss PsyOp has been fully activated to her upcoming 2024 voter operation for Democrats [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=23.34s)]
*  on abortion rights. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=29.7s)]
*  You read that correctly. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=31.3s)]
*  Former Trump immigration adviser Stephen Miller, he wanted to weigh in on it as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=32.64s)]
*  So he added, what's happening with Taylor Swift is not organic. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=36.62s)]
*  You heard it from Republicans first, folks. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=41.56s)]
*  If Trump loses in 2024, it is because of the pure political magnetism of none other than [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=43.54s)]
*  Taylor Swift. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=48.94s)]
*  He never stood a chance against her. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=50.32s)]
*  Kurt Bardella and Hayes Brown are back with me to discuss this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=52.06s)]
*  So, I didn't think that we would be having a conversation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=55.5s)]
*  It was not on my bingo card or bingo board to have a conversation by Taylor Swift election [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=58.86s)]
*  conspiracy theory. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=63.5s)]
*  But here we are at the end of the year, Republicans batting it around. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=65.06s)]
*  Yeah, that is where we are. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=69.3s)]
*  Somehow, I'm as shocked as you are. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=72.82s)]
*  I mean, I guess they're still upset that Trump never made time out of the year. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what this conspiracy is about, except for the fact that they're so afraid [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=80.18s)]
*  of the power of what girls and women are into. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  That's the only vibes I'm getting off of this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  We are terrified of the things that women and girls find popular. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  So clearly, it must be some sort of Psyop to manipulate the American public. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=99.28s)]
*  No, there's no way that Taylor Swift is this popular on her own. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=106.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=111.4s)]
*  It's like, well, who does she speak to? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=112.4s)]
*  She speaks to a large segment of this population that could turn out to vote. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=113.54s)]
*  And that's what they suddenly are worried about. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=116.64s)]
*  And could you ever have predicted this mutation of the 2020 rigged election claims? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=118.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, they just keep taking it to a whole new level. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=124.52s)]
*  And honestly, I think they're playing with fire here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=128.88s)]
*  If there's one person that you do not want to get into any kind of PR war with, it's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=130.88s)]
*  Taylor Swift. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=136.36s)]
*  She is one communications marketing genius, savant. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=138.64s)]
*  There is no one like her on the face of this planet. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=143.4s)]
*  And if Republicans want to keep talking about her and mouthing off about her and attacking [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=147.32s)]
*  her, I don't think they appreciate the mobility and the velocity of the Swifty Army because [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=152.32s)]
*  they will come for you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=158.12s)]
*  And there is it is one of the most powerful, organic, organizing communities on the face [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=159.56s)]
*  of the earth, what they have done to propel her tour and the release of her tour to a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  movie theater, to billion dollar status. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  Why on earth would you want to poke that bear unless you want to get shellacked in November? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=173.2s)]
*  So it's an interesting point, Hayes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=177.28s)]
*  I mean, the New Republic put out a piece saying, quote, to some degree, Swift is a uniquely [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  apolitical pick for Times Person of the Year. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=182.8s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=185.84s)]
*  Is her connection to politics really getting overblown by the far right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=186.92s)]
*  I mean, yes and no. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=191.32s)]
*  Like, let's not forget that back in 2016, Taylor Swift was sort of seen as an icon amongst [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=192.8s)]
*  the weirdo alt-right, like white supremacy girlies out there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=199.16s)]
*  They really were like, she's one of us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=205.44s)]
*  And because she was silent at the time, they were allowed to sort of have this idea of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  her as their Nordic princess, weirdly enough. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=212.48s)]
*  But then once she started actually speaking out and for example, they showed in the, I [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=216.4s)]
*  believe, Eris in which was the tour before this, the one that went to theaters. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=223.36s)]
*  Anyway, in 2018, she endorsed Marsha Blackburn's opponent in Tennessee in the Senate. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=229.72000000000003s)]
*  They were the bubble was popped and now they have never forgiven Taylor Swift. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  They think that she should be on her side. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=239.24s)]
*  And the fact that she's not is, hey, hi, you're the problem. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, you can tell between the three of us that we're not hardcore [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=245.8s)]
*  Swifties if we do not know the name of every tour and album that she has dropped. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=248.84s)]
*  But I think it was the reputation tour. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=254.0s)]
*  What was it? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  The reputation tour. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=258.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=259.92s)]
*  I'm impressed, Kurt. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  I think you've just earned Swifty status, my friend. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=261.72s)]
*  I have this, I have this other life in country music. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=264.24s)]
*  I went to, I've been to both shows, the reputation tour and the Eris tour, man. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=266.92s)]
*  No, good for you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=271.64s)]
*  I have mad respect for you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=272.48s)]
*  But I do, I do want to pick up on the point that Hayes brought up, which is her impact [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=274.8s)]
*  on elections, which is a real issue. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=280.16s)]
*  I mean, you had some far right commentators actually connect Taylor Swift to some big [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=282.88s)]
*  wins in November centered on abortion rights after she encouraged her fans to vote in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=286.36s)]
*  local elections. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=290.52s)]
*  What is your take on this and should Democrats try to tap into her and her potential? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=292.28s)]
*  I think Democrats should stay the hell away from Taylor. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=299.68s)]
*  I think that Republicans should stay the hell away from Taylor for their own good. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=302.4s)]
*  I think Taylor's going to do what Taylor is going to do. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=305.84s)]
*  This is someone who put out a post on social media saying register the vote and she got [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=308.08s)]
*  50,000 people to do that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=311.04s)]
*  The connection that she has with her fans and particularly with young women and young [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=313.2s)]
*  girls and teenage girls is incredibly strong and it is moving and it is bigger than politics. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=316.84s)]
*  It is about community. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=322.28s)]
*  It is about autonomy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=323.36s)]
*  It is about independence. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=324.52s)]
*  It is about power. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=325.76s)]
*  Just as she did with her own masters, rerecording her masters after they were sold out from [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=327.04s)]
*  under her by her former music label and creating this new art from her old music and making [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=332.08s)]
*  it incredibly successful on the charts and profitable, she is the blueprint for the modern [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=337.92s)]
*  day woman coming of age of how to take the power back from male dominated power structures. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=343.96s)]
*  Taylor's going to do what she's going to do and I think that if Democrats are smart, they [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=348.84s)]
*  won't lean into it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=351.56s)]
*  They will let her just do the work for them and then sit back and reap the benefits. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  Kurt, we may be designating you as our official Taylor Swift correspondent on this show. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=356.48s)]
*  I would be surprised. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=361.4s)]
*  Did you actually apply for that position when it came up a couple of weeks ago? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=362.68s)]
*  There was a position that came up for I think at the USA Today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=365.68s)]
*  Did you apply for it? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=367.8s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=369.36s)]
*  I'm egregiously unqualified for that, unfortunately, but I would take it if they gave it to me. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=370.04s)]
*  Well, we certainly appreciate it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=374.48s)]
*  You can have that title on this show whenever we discuss Taylor Swift and her impact. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=375.6s)]
*  We will bring you back on this program. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=379.2s)]
*  Kurt Bardella, Hayes Brown, gentlemen. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=381.24s)]
*  Great to have you on the show tonight. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=382.72s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ&t=384.24s)]
