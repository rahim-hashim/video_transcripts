# 'Voting integrity is on the line': PA special election winner shares insights for fellow Democrats
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY)
*  Democrat Jim Prokopiak beat Republican Candice Kavanus in the state House race in Bucks County, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=0.0s)]
*  just north of Philadelphia. Now, while it's just two seats here, his victory cements the Democrats' [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=6.4s)]
*  hold on its razor-thin majority in the state House, which is a huge deal for two very important [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=12.0s)]
*  reasons. One, it keeps MAGA Republicans from controlling the next election. And two, it gives [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=18.48s)]
*  Democrats a preview at where they stand with American voters in Pennsylvania and beyond. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=23.68s)]
*  Because Prokopiak didn't just win, he took it by a staggering 35-point margin. Pennsylvania [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  state representative-elect Jim Prokopiak is with us now. Sir, first of all, congratulations [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  on your race, and thank you so much for joining us. This was an important race. The balance of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=42.0s)]
*  power in Pennsylvania in the state House has been on the line now four times in a single year. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=46.24s)]
*  That's quite a lot. What does it mean for your party to be holding this majority in the Pennsylvania [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=51.84s)]
*  state House? Well, thank you for having me. And this race wasn't just about me. It was about the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  whole Democratic agenda that Speaker McClinton has been fighting for for the last year, about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  pushing forth an agenda that fully funds education, protects women's reproductive rights, fights for a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=69.92s)]
*  livable wage in Pennsylvania. It's a big deal for working families. Well, let me ask you about those [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=75.84s)]
*  goals. You said one of the big fights in the state House right now is funding education. In addition [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=82.08s)]
*  to that, give me some of your top priorities and your top goals heading into office. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  One of the things we need to do, and it's been recognized by the Commonwealth Court here in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Pennsylvania, is that the state has not done its job in fully funding education in the state. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=96.4s)]
*  That has led to local taxpayers having to foot the bill for property taxes in funding education. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=101.28s)]
*  We need to do more so that our kids have the best chance at success in life. One of the concerns [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=107.2s)]
*  that people have had about MAGA Republicans in Pennsylvania is that they have gotten [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=114.08s)]
*  increasingly extreme, not just with the candidates of who they put forward, but the ones that are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=119.2s)]
*  actually in the party now. And they've been recently pushing to change election rules. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=123.12s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about that threat, that concern. How do you plan to push back against [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=129.6s)]
*  these efforts to protect election integrity, which is going to be a central issue going into 2024? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. Especially here in Bucks County, which is a swing county, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=139.92s)]
*  and Pennsylvania is a swing state. So the biggest thing we're doing, first of all, is making sure [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=144.32s)]
*  that people come out and vote in November. I think that one of the reasons why we had, say, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=149.27999999999997s)]
*  a large victory was because people understood that voting integrity is on the line here, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=154.64s)]
*  not just here in Pennsylvania, but all across the country. And so I think voters are well aware [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=160.72s)]
*  that we need to fight and come out and vote, or else someone may take away that right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=165.6s)]
*  If you had to say a message to the broader Democratic party, because obviously people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  are going to be looking at your race and other races across this country, these special races, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=174.0s)]
*  as bellwether races to kind of gauge what's coming down the pipeline in 2024, what is your message to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=179.04s)]
*  fellow Democrats, including President Biden, in regard to how they campaign, how they engage, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  how they win over specifically Pennsylvania voters, which is going to be one of the most [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=190.72s)]
*  important states in the 2024 race? What do you think he needs to prioritize? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=195.76s)]
*  Well, I can talk about what we really focused on, which is the really economic issues, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  talking about working class families and what the struggles they're facing right now, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=209.2s)]
*  and how we want to help them, how we're working to really focus on making sure that they can pay [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=213.12s)]
*  their bills, have their kids get a good quality education, and then also talking about the rights [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  that are on the line here. The simple fact is that what may not be the most important issue [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=225.04s)]
*  in voters' minds, it's a very important issue in my region and district, is the continued [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  protection of women's reproductive rights here in Pennsylvania. So I think an economic message [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=238.0s)]
*  combined that provides common sense solutions to problems that workers' working families [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=242.56s)]
*  struggle with, as well as protecting their rights here in Pennsylvania, both reproductive rights [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=249.76s)]
*  and voting rights and those types of things, I think will be a winning issue in the suburbs. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=254.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's going to be a very close race to watch on all these issues. Pennsylvania State [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=257.76s)]
*  Representative-elect Jim Prokopiak, sir, thank you so much for your time. I greatly appreciate it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=261.6s)]
*  We look forward to having you back on the show once you are in office and running. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=265.2s)]
*  you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7neOA0riApY&t=272.56s)]
