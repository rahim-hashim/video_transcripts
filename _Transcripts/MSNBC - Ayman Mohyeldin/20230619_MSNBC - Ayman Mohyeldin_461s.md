# Democrats fight back against PGA-LIV merger
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A)
*  A tour sparked outrage and shock this month when the organization announced that it would [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=0.0s)]
*  merge with its Saudi-backed rival, Live Golf. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=6.86s)]
*  Human Rights Watch said, quote, Saudi Arabia's state fund will apparently largely control [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  professional golf while also sportswashing the country's dismal human rights record. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=13.82s)]
*  Once upon a time, that sentiment, believe it or not, was actually shared by the PGA [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=18.66s)]
*  Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, who said last year, quote, you'd have to be living under [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=22.98s)]
*  a rock to not understand the implications of involving yourself with the Saudis. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=27.14s)]
*  His words, not mine. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=32.24s)]
*  But Monahan has since done a 180-degree change, now saying, quote, the game is better off [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=33.88s)]
*  for what we have done. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Not everyone is sure of that, though. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=41.74s)]
*  The Justice Department has notified the PGA Tour. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  It will review the merger over antitrust concerns. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  Democratic Congressman John Garamendi of California was one of the first members of Congress to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=49.72s)]
*  actually condemn the merger. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=53.08s)]
*  He has since introduced legislation to strip the PGA Tour of its corporate tax exemptions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=54.88s)]
*  Congressman Garamendi joins me now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=61.14s)]
*  Congressman, it's great to see you again on the show. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=62.5s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  So what do you make of this complete 180 from the PGA? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  How do you explain it? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=68.22s)]
*  Money, money, money, money, and billions of dollars of money. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=69.86s)]
*  The Saudi sovereign wealth fund has perhaps as much as a trillion dollars in their accounts, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  and they're spending it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  They're buying players a couple hundred million dollars here and there for a soccer player. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=83.46s)]
*  And who knows what Monahan got out of this, but it's all about money. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=88.14s)]
*  And it is just absolutely outrageous that we would allow the Saudi sovereign wealth [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=93.06s)]
*  fund and all the bad things that they have done to the United States, to Meshuggah and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=99.88s)]
*  others to be able to profit and benefit from a tax exemption. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=105.02s)]
*  PGA is a charity. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=111.52s)]
*  Why would PGA be a charity when it makes a billion and a half dollars a year? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  Good question. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=118.28s)]
*  We ought to terminate that and let PGA be a standard corporation, let them pay their [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=119.28s)]
*  income taxes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=123.8s)]
*  And if they want to do a charity, well, go ahead and make your charitable donation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=124.8s)]
*  Let's talk about this notion that Human Rights Watch laid out that this is effectively an [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=129.6s)]
*  effort to sportswash Saudi Arabia's human rights record. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=133.9s)]
*  Do you see that? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=137.28s)]
*  Is there a cause to believe that that's what they're doing? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=138.28s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=145.46s)]
*  There's no doubt that Saudi Arabia is using its vast sums of money, which, by the way, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=146.74s)]
*  that's our gas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=151.98s)]
*  When you go to the gas pump, that's Saudi money that you're putting into that credit [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=154.34s)]
*  card and it goes off to Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  So they're using our money in two different ways. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=161.22s)]
*  They'll use it directly for the gas pump and then indirectly through the PGA not being [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=163.58s)]
*  taxed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  And yes, absolutely. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  They're using their money to hide the fact or to sportswash. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  That is just to cause people not to any longer pay attention to an absolutely abysmal human [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  rights effort over many, many years. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=180.8s)]
*  What do you say to critics who say it's a bit rich for the U.S. government, which deals [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia, you know, sells weapons to Saudi Arabia, has relationships with other [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=189.9s)]
*  governments that have abysmal human rights record that end up buying assets in America, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=195.54000000000002s)]
*  whether they are sports or corporations. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=199.34s)]
*  What do you say that Saudi Arabia is being unfairly singled out here for doing what other [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  countries do, including with the United States government? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=206.46s)]
*  Well, let's just focus very, very clearly on what we're talking about here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=210.46s)]
*  We're talking about Saudi Arabia using our gas money to buy the PGA or to buy most of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=215.3s)]
*  it and then to get an exemption from corporate taxes here in the United States. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=223.06s)]
*  So they're taking it at the gas pump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=229.5s)]
*  They're also taking it here in not paying taxes in the United States on the PGA. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=231.46s)]
*  And the anti-competitive issue is a very real one. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=236.94s)]
*  All of those things add up. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=239.74s)]
*  Yes, we do sell arms to Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=241.38000000000002s)]
*  And yes, Saudi Arabia has been a very serious problem in the Middle East. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=244.38s)]
*  You might ask the Yemenis how they feel about Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=248.78s)]
*  Unfortunately, the United States has not moved away from petroleum fast enough, and we are [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  still dependent on petroleum. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=259.98s)]
*  Saudi Arabia controls so much of the world's supply that they're able to manipulate the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=262.7s)]
*  price. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=268.22s)]
*  About three, four months ago, excuse me, about seven months ago, President Biden went to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=269.62s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and asked Saudi Arabia to increase, to increase its production so that the world [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=274.82s)]
*  supply of petroleum would increase and the prices would come down. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=281.06s)]
*  He came back empty-handed in what I believe was a very embarrassing situation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  And just a week and a half ago, Saudi Arabia further reduced its supply of oil to the world, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=290.46s)]
*  which will once again increase prices here in the United States. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=299.02s)]
*  What do we do about this? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=303.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, we don't give them a tax break. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=304.97999999999996s)]
*  If they want to own all of the professional golf systems as they are doing now, then they [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=307.38s)]
*  sure as hell ought to be paying taxes in the United States on the profit that they're making [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=314.41999999999996s)]
*  here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=318.9s)]
*  Secondly, we ought to look very, very seriously at the anti-competition issue. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=319.9s)]
*  If you own a golf course, for example, bedminister, a month ago, you could go to the PGA and say, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=325.7s)]
*  hey, I'm open on August. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  You want a tour here? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=333.5s)]
*  You could also go to leave. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=334.82s)]
*  You could play one off against the other. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=335.94s)]
*  Not any longer. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  You're going to take whatever this new entity is going to offer because they control it [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  all. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=343.9s)]
*  Similarly, for a professional player, they have no choice but to take whatever this new [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=344.9s)]
*  system is going to offer. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=349.58s)]
*  That is the anti-competitive nature of this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=351.58s)]
*  Not only in the United States, but also in Europe. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=354.9s)]
*  So we've got to go at this very, very clearly. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=357.58s)]
*  No tax break for Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  No tax breaks for the PGA, which they never should have had in the first place. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  And secondly, let's look at this human rights business and say, no, we're not going to go [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  this way. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=372.2s)]
*  And we're going to look at the anti-competitive nature along the way. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=373.2s)]
*  Let me ask you really quickly. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=376.2s)]
*  We have about 45 seconds left about the bill that you have introduced. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=377.2s)]
*  Are you getting any bipartisan support for it? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=380.46s)]
*  Specifically, what do you want this bill to do if it does make its way to the president's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=383.3s)]
*  desk after the House and the Senate? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=387.5s)]
*  This bill is very, very simple. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=390.7s)]
*  It simply ends the charitable status of the PGA and makes them a corporation like any [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=392.06s)]
*  other profit corporation. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=397.18s)]
*  Yes, we do have support. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=398.7s)]
*  This bill was actually introduced by the Trump administration in 2017. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=400.92s)]
*  It was not in the final bill. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=406.8s)]
*  A couple of Republican senators have introduced the bill. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=408.38s)]
*  And there are many members of Congress and the Senate that are looking at this seriously [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=411.46s)]
*  and saying, hey, this is something we ought to do. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=415.62s)]
*  We ought to end the tax break for the PGA. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=418.41999999999996s)]
*  And certainly, Saudi Arabia ought not be benefiting from a tax-exempt operation here in the United [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=420.73999999999995s)]
*  States. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=427.26s)]
*  Congressman John Garamendi of California, it's always a pleasure, sir. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=428.26s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time and thanks for coming back on. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=431.44s)]
*  We'll be on the talk. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GPbMZtuH4A&t=435.14s)]
