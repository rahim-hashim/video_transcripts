Video Description: As Democrats grapple with difficult questions after this week’s electoral losses, they may find inspiration from an unlikely source. As a senior aide to Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin found herself inextricably linked to the devastating 2016 electoral loss, which she details closely in her new memoir “Both/And: A Life in Many Worlds.” MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin spoke to Abedin about her political career at the pinnacle of American politics, and the lessons she learned from Clinton’s 2016 defeat.

# Huma Abedin On Power, Politics, And The Lessons Of 2016
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [November 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU)
*  Let us begin with the first question and I wanted to specifically start with this because it is something that is very personal to me and it is something I've heard you talk about over the last couple of days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=0.0s)]
*  What is the correct pronunciation of your name? How would you like to be pronounced? How would you like your name to be pronounced? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Well, I have gone through all the different names in my book if you listen to the audio. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=16.6s)]
*  I can empathize with that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=21.2s)]
*  I'm sure you can, Eamon. It is pronounced Huma. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=22.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=25.0s)]
*  But most people say Huma and I respond to both, but it is pronounced Homa. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=25.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=30.8s)]
*  Well, I'm going to go with Homa, the proper pronunciation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Listen, it's great to have you here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=33.8s)]
*  I really appreciate you taking time for us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=36.0s)]
*  I know it's been a crazy week and busy week for you, but I wanted to first of all talk to you a little bit about your book and get your thoughts. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=37.6s)]
*  You know, as someone who is very close to power in Washington, DC and the lessons that you learned in terms of election losses, this was a bit of a setback for Democrats this week with some of the election losses. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  What lessons do you have for some of the candidates and for those in politics based on your experience in what Democrats in Virginia just went through? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=55.4s)]
*  Well, look, I think the best advice I can give is we just have to stay focused and, you know, get reorganized and keep the energy and enthusiasm and elections are cycles. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=63.4s)]
*  And we're in the midst of a cycle. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=74.4s)]
*  President Biden is trying to do some very difficult things in Washington. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=76.4s)]
*  He just got one very big thing done this morning. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=79.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=82.4s)]
*  And we just have to stay focused. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=83.4s)]
*  I mean, it's a long road. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=86.4s)]
*  It's a long road ahead. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=89.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=90.4s)]
*  I know that you write in the book about being a Muslim woman. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=91.4s)]
*  You talked about growing up in Saudi Arabia and the worldview that was shaped by your experiences overseas and how your parents raised you and the experiences that you had there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=93.4s)]
*  And I was wondering, you know, and I know you talked about this a little bit in the book, but elaborate on how your worldview and the experiences that you had growing up before you came to university in Washington, D.C., shaped the experience that you had at the height of American political power. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=104.4s)]
*  Well, you know, my parents were two immigrants, my father from India and my mother came from Pakistan. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=121.4s)]
*  They were Fulbright scholars. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=126.4s)]
*  For them, education was a religion. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=127.4s)]
*  They met at the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=130.4s)]
*  And when I was two, I was born in Michigan. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=132.4s)]
*  My father was diagnosed with renal failure and told he had five to ten years to live. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=134.4s)]
*  And so I write this one of the first lines I wrote in the book. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=138.4s)]
*  My father was told he was dying. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=141.4s)]
*  So he went out and lived and we moved to Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=142.4s)]
*  And I think one of the greatest gifts my parents gave us was this curiosity about the world. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=145.4s)]
*  They took us to all different places and cultures and we learned different languages and religions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=151.4s)]
*  And I think it's because my father, what motivated both my parents was this notion of trying to understand the other. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=156.4s)]
*  His colleagues would say, don't go into these places and have conversations where even angels fear to tread. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=162.4s)]
*  And my father was exactly the opposite. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=167.4s)]
*  It's like it's important to talk to the other side and try to understand it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=169.4s)]
*  And I think when I landed in the White House in 1996 as a 21-year-old intern, having that grounding, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=172.4s)]
*  appreciating and understanding different culture and also bringing a whole new culture. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=179.4s)]
*  There weren't a lot of Muslims wandering around the White House in 1996. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=184.4s)]
*  And it was an administration that really welcomed and was curious about me and my life experience. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=188.4s)]
*  And as a result, I had the opportunity to do some amazing things. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=193.4s)]
*  I mean, how many 24-year-olds were wandering around Camp David? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=197.4s)]
*  Peace talks and I was there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=200.4s)]
*  I had the privilege of being there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=202.4s)]
*  Thanks to President Clinton. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=203.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=204.4s)]
*  And I'm going to get into that in just a minute. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=205.4s)]
*  But also I know that your identity was weaponized and used against you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=206.4s)]
*  And it's something I think that a lot of Muslims in this country have had to endure at various points in their professional lives. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=210.4s)]
*  But I wanted to play for you this sound bite. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=216.4s)]
*  I know that in 2012, Michelle Bachman attacked you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=219.4s)]
*  But I want to play you this sound bite from then who's now, I guess, then Congressman Sean Duffy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=221.4s)]
*  But he had something to say about your identity as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=227.4s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=229.4s)]
*  Why are we talking about her ties to the Muslim and the Muslim Brotherhood? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=230.4s)]
*  Why are we talking about the fact that she was an editor? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=236.4s)]
*  She doesn't have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=239.4s)]
*  When you heard elected officials talk about you that way and weaponize your faith and identity [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=241.4s)]
*  and try to say that a member of the Muslim Brotherhood infiltrated the highest levels of U.S. government, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=248.4s)]
*  what did that make you feel? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=254.4s)]
*  What impact did that have on your family? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=256.4s)]
*  And did it ever impact the work that you do? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=258.4s)]
*  It was arguably the most devastating personal experience that I've had in my years in government. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=261.4s)]
*  And for me, I come from that part of the world where your reputation is everything. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=267.4s)]
*  And to have it sullied, I mean, what made me infuriated about it, and number one, I want to note, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=272.4s)]
*  it wasn't just me. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=278.4s)]
*  They attacked other Muslims, you know, high-ranking Muslims in government. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=279.4s)]
*  And it was an appetizer, really, for what was coming in 2016 and 2020. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=283.4s)]
*  But the fact that it was the very opposite of what my father and mother's journal stood for, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=289.4s)]
*  that it was all about understanding and faith, I mean, it was hypocrisy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=295.4s)]
*  And it was shocking, amen. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=299.4s)]
*  I really had a very hard time dealing with it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=302.4s)]
*  And when John McCain went to the floor of the Senate to defend my family [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=304.4s)]
*  and then President Obama at the time did the same thing, I mean, they were defending me, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=308.4s)]
*  but it wasn't just defending me. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=311.4s)]
*  They were defending American values and ideals. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=313.4s)]
*  This is not who we are as Americans. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=317.4s)]
*  And it is one of the many reasons I wrote the book. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=319.4s)]
*  Muslims can be part of the both-and. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=322.4s)]
*  I can be an American patriot and also a practicing Muslim. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=324.4s)]
*  And so how did that, I guess, also the flip side to that question, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=329.4s)]
*  were there ever moments, because also you work at the State Department [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=332.4s)]
*  and certainly work on issues of foreign policy, were there ever moments [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=335.4s)]
*  where you found that foreign policy was at odds with your own personal values [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=338.4s)]
*  and tried to shape it based on what you had experienced and what you had seen? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=343.4s)]
*  And were there ever moments where the policy rubbed up against things [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=347.4s)]
*  that you personally thought were going in the wrong direction that you tried to change? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=351.4s)]
*  Well, you know, I just want to reiterate, I mean, I was not a policy person. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=355.4s)]
*  I am not a policy person. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=358.4s)]
*  But I did appreciate from day one that, you know, in the Clinton White House, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=360.4s)]
*  we celebrated Ramadan for the first time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=364.4s)]
*  And every time I would have an idea or suggestion, it was welcomed and it was accepted. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=366.4s)]
*  I write in the book, The Painful Night of the Iraq War Vote, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=371.4s)]
*  under President George W. Bush's administration. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=376.4s)]
*  That was personally very difficult for me. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=379.4s)]
*  I recount the scene in the book where my Syrian-American friend calls me and says, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=381.4s)]
*  I hope Hillary Clinton is not going to vote for this war. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=384.4s)]
*  And I knew how she was going to vote at that point. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=387.4s)]
*  Those were difficult personal moments for me. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=390.4s)]
*  So I had no problem expressing my views. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=392.4s)]
*  And then obviously the Arab Spring, I had lots of personal opinions [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=395.4s)]
*  working at the State Department at the time. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=400.4s)]
*  But also because as a young woman who grew up in Saudi Arabia, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=402.4s)]
*  it was very hard to explain that I did not, I personally do not believe that democracy, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=405.4s)]
*  the way a lot of the Western governments, a lot of Western governments see it, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=412.4s)]
*  is what other countries believe is how their governments should be run. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=415.4s)]
*  And we're still seeing that play out. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=420.4s)]
*  It's been a decade since the Arab Spring. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=422.4s)]
*  And there's a lot that, you know, is still convulsing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=424.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=428.4s)]
*  And the chapter on that is still to be written, it seems. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=429.4s)]
*  Let me ask you finally, just because you work as obviously one of the most influential, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=431.4s)]
*  most important women politicians in this country's history, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=435.4s)]
*  we've had since a woman elected to the role of vice president, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=438.4s)]
*  talk to us a little bit about the glass ceiling that has been broken. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=442.4s)]
*  And more importantly, given how toxic our current politics are, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=446.4s)]
*  what do you say or what should this country do to continue to recruit more women politicians [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=449.4s)]
*  and to get more women politicians to the highest levels of government? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=455.4s)]
*  You know, for me, I'm doing right now the thing with you that scares me the most, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=459.4s)]
*  and that's sitting and speaking and being out in the world. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=463.4s)]
*  And the one piece of advice I give to any young women who ask you for advice [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ7cBuvVWfU&t=466.4s)]
