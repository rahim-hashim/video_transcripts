# Trump's creepy efforts to Make Women Great Again are backfiring
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc)
*  Switching gears now to the race for president back in 2015 when Donald Trump was first running [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=0.0s)]
*  for president, he tried to assure voters repeatedly that he respects women. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=5.44s)]
*  I cherish women. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=11.28s)]
*  I respect women more than I respect men. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=13.56s)]
*  Are the men insulted by that, by the way? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=16.32s)]
*  No. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=18.6s)]
*  See, they all say no. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=19.6s)]
*  But I have great respect, admiration, and I cherish women. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=20.6s)]
*  Bizarre? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=26.84s)]
*  Creepy? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=28.12s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=29.64s)]
*  But many women actually bought it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=30.64s)]
*  In fact, he got the majority of votes from some groups of women, including middle-aged [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  white women. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=36.88s)]
*  Now, facing an uphill battle against Vice President Kamala Harris, he is leaning into [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=37.88s)]
*  that old rhetoric again, except now it's actually turbocharged. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=41.92s)]
*  You will no longer be abandoned, lonely, or scared. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=47.92s)]
*  You will no longer be in danger. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=51.56s)]
*  You're not going to be in danger any longer. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=53.68s)]
*  You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=56.88s)]
*  You will be protected and I will be your protector. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=63.78s)]
*  Women will be happy, healthy, confident, and free. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=67.34s)]
*  Now, he has ramped up his unhinged paternalistic pledge quite a bit in recent weeks, not just [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  at rallies, but also on his failed social media site, too. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  Let's remember who we're talking about here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=82.4s)]
*  This man, the self-proclaimed protector of women, has been accused of sexual assault [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=85.1s)]
*  and harassment by at least 26 women since the 1970s, a man who was found liable, legally [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=90.22s)]
*  liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996, the judge later clarifying [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  that what Trump did was in fact rape, a man who at every turn takes responsibility for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=102.1s)]
*  the overturning of Roe versus Wade, which has left millions of women in this country [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=107.89999999999999s)]
*  vulnerable to health care emergencies and in some cases even death. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=111.98s)]
*  So when you hear that track record and then you hear this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=116.18s)]
*  I am your protector. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=121.30000000000001s)]
*  I want to be your protector as president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=122.62s)]
*  I have to be your protector. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=124.5s)]
*  I hope you don't make too much of it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  I hope the fake news is ago. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  He wants to be their protector. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, I am. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=131.3s)]
*  The comments don't just ring hollow. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=133.08s)]
*  They actually are quite sinister. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=135.22s)]
*  One columnist at New York magazine made the blunt observation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=137.5s)]
*  He sounds like a domestic abuser. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=141.14s)]
*  Trump is casting himself as a kind of husband to America's women and presents himself as [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  the solution to all of their problems that he imagines they are having in their lives. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  To him, their quote anxiety is being misdirected into the belief that they want abortion to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=152.2s)]
*  be legal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=157.33999999999997s)]
*  But instead he insists their real problems are loneliness and abandonment, something [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  if they give themselves over to him and he can't even fathom that women wouldn't like [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=166.1s)]
*  him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=172.74s)]
*  I always thought women liked me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  I never thought I had a problem. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  But the fake news keeps saying women don't like me. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=182.29999999999998s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=184.5s)]
*  Well, it's quite clear he doesn't believe it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=185.5s)]
*  That kind of overconfidence, sexist head in the sand approach has helped shape his campaign [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=188.74s)]
*  strategy over the past several months. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=193.9s)]
*  He's been on what one could call the dude influencer circuit, chatting it up on podcasts [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=195.34s)]
*  with the likes of Logan Paul, Aiden Ross, Kyle Forgard, all of them men, many of them [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=201.02s)]
*  young men and fueled by a narrow old view, old world view of masculinity. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=208.02s)]
*  And no big surprise here, seven of the nine podcasts that he has appeared on recently [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  have audiences that are overwhelmingly entirely men. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  Trump appears to also be drawing from even darker misogynistic corners of the Internet. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=223.02s)]
*  A report by Wired suggests that he and his close allies are taking notes from the influencer [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=227.66s)]
*  and accused human sex trafficker, Andrew Tate. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=232.74s)]
*  Tate has said that women who don't have children are, among other things, miserable and stupid. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=236.34s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, the resurfaced comments from JD Vance about childless cat ladies have shown that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump's running mate is on the exact same wavelength. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=247.78s)]
*  It's no wonder Trump's recent message to women in this country are so small-minded and paternalistic. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=251.38s)]
*  He's immersed in a cesspool of highly misogynistic men. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=256.7s)]
*  But here's the thing, despite that, just like in 2016, some women are still trending towards [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=260.06s)]
*  voting for Trump. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  Even though Harris has a slight edge over Trump with women voters, a recent Quinnipiac [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=268.96s)]
*  University poll shows that Harris's lead on Trump with women voters has dropped by nine [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=272.6s)]
*  points in the last month alone. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=277.34s)]
*  To help us make sense of all of this, our list plank, MSNBC columnist and author of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=281.14s)]
*  For the Love of Men and MSNBC's Molly Jung-Fass, political analyst. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  She's also host of the Fast Politics podcast and a special correspondent for Vanity Fair. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=289.14s)]
*  Do you feel protected by Donald Trump, Molly? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=294.94s)]
*  What kind of question is that? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=297.78s)]
*  I'm excited to not have anxiety. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=299.78s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=302.26s)]
*  There are a lot of good promises. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=303.26s)]
*  Healthy, confident, won't worry. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=304.26s)]
*  There was another speech where he said, no one's ever going to think about abortion again. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=306.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, look, Donald Trump is clearly seeing internal polling that's showing that women [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  are not having it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=315.14000000000004s)]
*  And that this double down strategy, I mean, basically what Trump learned in 2016 was that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  he could get these low propensity voters out if he had a radical enough message. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=321.42s)]
*  And I think he's sort of never gotten over that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=326.5s)]
*  So they're going like full white dude and full masculine guy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  And they're just totally doubling down on that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=333.88s)]
*  And now he's seeing that it's turning women off. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=335.9s)]
*  So instead of being normal, he's decided he's going to say all these things about what he's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=338.46s)]
*  going to do for women. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  And somehow, because he's such a brilliant politician, it will make women believe it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=345.06s)]
*  So you bring up a really good point about the attitudes here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=350.17999999999995s)]
*  And Liz, I want to share this with you because despite his long track record of misogyny, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=352.73999999999995s)]
*  he's actually gaining some support from women. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  And I want to read this 63 year old woman and Trump supporter recently telling the Washington [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=359.26s)]
*  I'm a conservative and I'm a Christian and I believe that the woman's role is to be protected [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=363.74s)]
*  by a man. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=368.14s)]
*  And I believe God gave those roles. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=369.42s)]
*  So that's not derogatory to a woman. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=371.62s)]
*  That is anecdotal. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=375.46s)]
*  It's not I'm not trying to paint a broader brush or broader picture, if you will. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=376.62s)]
*  But you know, there are people who have these views in this country. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=382.74s)]
*  And that message will resonate with him when a race is so close. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=386.74s)]
*  She just needs to pick up a few thousand voters here and there. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=389.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=394.0s)]
*  And you know, white women particularly have often been put soldiers for the patriarchy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=396.04s)]
*  You know, it's sort of no surprise to hear a lot of women for who this message resonates. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  But you know, if I had to choose between being alone in a forest with a bear or Donald Trump, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=405.4s)]
*  I would choose the bear every single time. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=410.96s)]
*  And I'm sure that there are millions of women across the country and the world, I would [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  argue, who feel the exact same way, because at least if the bear attacks me, he's not [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=417.16s)]
*  going to blame me for it or say that I was too ugly to attack, which are things that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=421.36s)]
*  Donald Trump has literally said about the women who have accused him from accused him [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=425.56s)]
*  of one of which actually won her case against him. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=429.52s)]
*  And so the idea that Donald Trump would be a protector to women is like a fox saying [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=433.36s)]
*  that he'll make sure that the hen house stays unharmed. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=439.16s)]
*  That the fox in this case has already wreck havoc on the hen house and blame the chickens [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=443.54s)]
*  for it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=448.42s)]
*  And the irony of ironies that I think is really important to point out is that, you know, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=449.42s)]
*  women, if there weren't men like Donald Trump in the world, women actually wouldn't require [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=454.34000000000003s)]
*  protection. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  So he's creating this role of protector for himself. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  But he's the cause of a lot of harm and need for women's protection. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=469.54s)]
*  In today's society. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=470.54s)]
*  And so it's just another case of him causing the problem and then framing himself really [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=471.54s)]
*  as the solution to that problem. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=477.38s)]
*  Such a good point from Liz there about the rhetoric we're hearing from Trump. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=479.14000000000004s)]
*  And there's something to be said here as well that, you know, in some ways, perhaps in a [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=482.78000000000003s)]
*  twisted way, he's not just speaking to women. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=486.42s)]
*  He's actually speaking to a specific type of man. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=488.78000000000003s)]
*  There's a man out there who's going to see that and say, hey, I understand what Donald [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=491.68s)]
*  Trump is saying here and doing. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=495.94s)]
*  worldview because kind of what's implied is where the women's role in society is, the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=498.34s)]
*  way he talks about women in this kind of paternalistic way. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=502.9s)]
*  Also, with the outlets that he's going on, he's not going on women-owned media outlets [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=505.9s)]
*  or women-focused podcasts to deliver this message. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=512.26s)]
*  He's going on these like very misogynistic, very bravado, all-male type of podcasts to [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=515.42s)]
*  discuss it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=521.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=522.66s)]
*  I really think women are an afterthought here for Trump. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=523.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=525.78s)]
*  He knows this is a problem, but he knows if he could just pick up a few, cut the margins, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=527.22s)]
*  maybe he can eke it through. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=532.38s)]
*  And I think, look, you know, he should be worried about women voters. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=534.74s)]
*  The fact that there are women voters who still want to vote for him, you know, considering [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=538.6999999999999s)]
*  that he did brag about ending Roe v. Wade. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=543.4599999999999s)]
*  And we do see such powerful shifts towards voting on reproductive rights when it comes [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=546.38s)]
*  to ballot initiatives. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=552.38s)]
*  It's kind of shocking to me, but it does seem that he's just sort of—I think he's just [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=554.74s)]
*  trying to pick up those voters and the margins. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=558.6999999999999s)]
*  Liz, your thoughts on this as well? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=560.62s)]
*  I mean, why are it is making the connection between Trump, Vance and Andrew Tate, and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=562.1s)]
*  when it comes to their rhetoric, how does this fit into Trump's twisted, you know, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=566.9s)]
*  worldview on women? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=572.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=574.66s)]
*  Thank you for connecting those two issues. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=575.66s)]
*  You know, so often we talk about women in one block, and we talk about masculinity maybe [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=577.78s)]
*  later. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=581.74s)]
*  And these issues are really connected, right? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=583.1800000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of men who are suffering. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=585.1800000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of men who feel alone, who feel lost, who feel disaffected in this country. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=586.9s)]
*  You know, young men are more likely to be living with their parents than women are. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=592.4200000000001s)]
*  Young men are more likely to take their own lives than women are. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=596.58s)]
*  And so there's a real problem. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=599.86s)]
*  And you know, to Molly's point, I do think women are an afterthought for Trump. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=602.34s)]
*  I think that men are an afterthought sometimes for Democrats. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=606.46s)]
*  I think that Democrats have not gone as hard on this message in reaching men, particularly [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=609.38s)]
*  young men who are moving so fast to the right. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=614.5400000000001s)]
*  You know, yes, Trump is offering this archaic, old school type of masculinity, this sort [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=617.46s)]
*  of fantasy of what you can be as a man to solve all of your problems. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=622.0600000000001s)]
*  But Democrats have better policies for men, but they have to have a message, right, that's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=625.82s)]
*  as good as, you know, the one on the right. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=631.34s)]
*  And so I think there's a huge opportunity for Democrats to own this message and to be [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=635.02s)]
*  bold enough to speak to men and boys directly in the way that, you know, the right is doing [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=640.5s)]
*  in a way that's on the nose. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=645.3000000000001s)]
*  And to your point in your intro, I mean, they're pouring money into this. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQo3hxqKrKc&t=647.66s)]
