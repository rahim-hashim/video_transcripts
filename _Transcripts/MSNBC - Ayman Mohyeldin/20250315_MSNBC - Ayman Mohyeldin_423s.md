# The detention of Mahmoud Khalil is a flagrant assault on free speech
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8)
*  Many years from now, when historians look back at America in this age of Trump, there [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=0.0s)]
*  will be many, many examples of inflection points through which our society made its [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  descent into fascism, if that's sadly where we end up. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=11.4s)]
*  Well, one week ago tonight, the abduction of Mahmoud Khalil by the U.S. government will [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=15.96s)]
*  be one of those moments, and it was captured on camera. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=20.32s)]
*  This is the footage that was released Friday night by the ACLU. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=24.7s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=28.12s)]
*  What? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=29.12s)]
*  You're going to be under arrest. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=30.12s)]
*  So turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Stop resisting. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Stop resisting. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Okay, okay, he's not resisting. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  He's giving me his phone, okay? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  I understand. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  He's not resisting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Put your arm around. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Don't be happy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  You're going to have to come with us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm not going with you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Don't wait. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  No one is resisting. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  No one is getting worked up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  You guys really don't need to be doing all of that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Maybe it's fine. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Have you been keeping a dead person safe? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=54.12s)]
*  Hi, Amy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=55.12s)]
*  Yeah, they just handcuffed him and I don't know what to do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=56.12s)]
*  The voice that you heard pleading with government agents there is Khalil's wife, Noor Abdullah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=70.88s)]
*  She was born and raised in Flint, Michigan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=76.72s)]
*  She is eight months pregnant with their first child. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=79.36s)]
*  She now faces the prospect of giving birth while her husband, who has not been charged [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=82.38s)]
*  with any crime and is a legal permanent resident of this country, sits in an ICE detention [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=86.82s)]
*  facility in Louisiana under threat of deportation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=92.0s)]
*  Watching this is chilling. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=96.86s)]
*  Plainclothes police officers, one appearing to be wearing a Marvel T-shirt with no warrant [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=99.22s)]
*  and refusing to give their names. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil is a Palestinian refugee raised in war-torn Syria who somehow made his way [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=106.58s)]
*  legally to an elite university here in the United States where he was set to graduate [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=112.34s)]
*  with a master's degree. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=117.86s)]
*  He became a public spokesperson and leader on campus, challenging the U.S. government's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  support for Israel's onslaught on Gaza. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=124.7s)]
*  And now he has been snatched from a university residence hall while his wife looks on helplessly, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=127.94s)]
*  all for the crime of criticizing American foreign policy in the Middle East. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=133.78s)]
*  And to justify Khalil's arrest, the Trump administration cited an obscure foreign policy [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=138.14s)]
*  clause that allows the secretary of state to deport foreign nationals whom it deems [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=143.7s)]
*  basically threaten national security. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=150.38s)]
*  Now think about this for a second. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=153.77999999999997s)]
*  Marco Rubio, who reports seem to indicate is just secretary of state and name only, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=155.38s)]
*  is now alleging that this Columbia University grad student is a threat to American foreign [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  policy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=167.26s)]
*  If only, if only, protesting college students had this much power. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=168.94s)]
*  Students around the country have been protesting what most human rights groups have called [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=174.1s)]
*  Israel's genocide in Gaza. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=179.22s)]
*  They have been demanding their universities divest from companies that have handed in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=181.98s)]
*  it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=186.34s)]
*  Despite their protests, the Biden administration continued supporting it, and now the Trump [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=187.7s)]
*  administration wants America to take over Gaza and build resorts. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=191.9s)]
*  Honestly, we'd be much better off if those protesting students were somehow actually [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=197.3s)]
*  jeopardizing American foreign policy or could actually change it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  The Trump administration's inability to lay out a legitimate case against Khalil was on [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=207.1s)]
*  display this week when DHS official Troy Edgar struggled to give a basic coherent answer [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=211.5s)]
*  to NPR. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=217.86s)]
*  He's a legal permanent resident. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=219.86s)]
*  I have to keep insisting on it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=221.94000000000003s)]
*  He is a legal permanent resident. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=223.10000000000002s)]
*  So what is the standard? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=224.38000000000002s)]
*  Is any criticism of the Israeli government a deportable offense? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=225.94000000000003s)]
*  Like I said, I think that at this point, when he was entered into the country on a student [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=229.38000000000002s)]
*  visa, at any point we can go through and evaluate what his status is, and the secretary of state [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=236.86s)]
*  is basically using it right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=243.62s)]
*  Is any criticism of the United States government a deportable offense? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=244.62s)]
*  Like I said, you know, if you go through the process and you're a student and you're [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=249.02s)]
*  here on a visa and you go through at any point— [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=253.74s)]
*  Is any criticism of the government a deportable offense? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=256.58s)]
*  Edgar also conflated Mahmoud Khalil's pro-Palestinian activism with being supportive of Hamas, which [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=263.22s)]
*  the U.S. government classifies as a terrorist organization. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=269.90000000000003s)]
*  First of all, and it's important to be very clear about this, the U.S. government has [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=273.86s)]
*  not presented any evidence, and there has been no evidence of this so far. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=277.26s)]
*  And the conflation of those supporting Palestinian rights with being supportive of terrorism [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  is an ugly rhetorical attack. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=287.46s)]
*  Secondly, if someone were to vocally support Hamas or any other organizations deemed terrorists [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=289.7s)]
*  by the United States, that is protected by the First Amendment, too, even if we don't [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=295.18s)]
*  like it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=300.34s)]
*  And finally, there's a double standard on this so-called material support to Hamas. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=301.34s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu infamously propped up Hamas with billions [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  of dollars of funding through the Qatari government over the course of a decade in order to divide [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=310.73999999999995s)]
*  and conquer different Palestinian factions. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  And despite that material support for Hamas, he is actually welcomed into the U.S. with [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=319.38s)]
*  open arms. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=324.46s)]
*  And whatever you think of Israel or Palestine or whether you don't think about the Middle [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=325.46s)]
*  East at all, this case matters. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=329.85999999999996s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil and the legal fight that it will certainly birth going forward will define [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=334.18s)]
*  America for generations to come. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=338.92s)]
*  It could be the legal case that forces our people, our institutions and our judiciary [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=341.76s)]
*  to actually defend our country, our free speech and our civil liberties from fascistic authoritarian [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=346.36s)]
*  rule. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=353.04s)]
*  Or it could be the case through which fascism and totalitarianism are normalized under the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=354.66s)]
*  guise of preserving law and order on college campuses or combating hate, all to shield [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=360.32s)]
*  a foreign country from facing legitimate critiques over its human rights practices. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  And regardless of the long-term outcome, we are seeing in real time every day how the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=371.52s)]
*  cowardice and the silence of elected officials, those so-called free speech warriors aligning [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  with lobbying groups that are masquerading as civil rights organizations in this country [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=381.88s)]
*  so-called campus safety monitors, we now see how they can erode our civil liberties [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=386.54s)]
*  if we, the society, the politicians, the media, sit by, do nothing, abandon our vigilance [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=393.1s)]
*  and betray our responsibilities. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdb7Kl5i5s8&t=400.18s)]
