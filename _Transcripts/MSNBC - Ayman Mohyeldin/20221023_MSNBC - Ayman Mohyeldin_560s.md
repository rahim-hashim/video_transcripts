Video Description: With the midterm elections just weeks away, Republicans are doubling down on racist rhetoric to appeal to voters in the form of invoking the great replacement theory, darkening the skin color of their opponents in attack ads and accusing black people of being criminals. MSNBC Ayman’s Mohyeldin spoke with Steve Phillips, author of the new book, ‘How to Win the Civil War’, on this disturbing trend and what Democrats need to do to fight against it.

# GOP Doubles Down On Racist Rhetoric Going Into The Midterms
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs)
*  All right, now we just, as you saw, laid out the case there that Republicans are doubling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=0.0s)]
*  down on their racism as the midterms draw near, and more alt-right figures are embracing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=6.72s)]
*  white supremacism. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=12.76s)]
*  So the question now is, what should the Democrats be doing about it? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=14.5s)]
*  Steve Phillips, the founder and chairman of PowerPAC+, is out with a new book entitled [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=18.92s)]
*  How to Win the Civil War, Securing a Multiracial Democracy and Ending White Supremacy for Good. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=23.8s)]
*  Phillips takes Democrats to task, arguing, quote, Democrats remain reluctant to define [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=29.96s)]
*  and engage the actual fight we're facing, a fight characterized by the battle for justice, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=34.6s)]
*  equality, and inclusion of people of color and their allies on the one hand, and by a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=39.84s)]
*  virulent, fear-based white backlash on the other. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=44.52s)]
*  Steve Phillips joins me now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=48.68s)]
*  Steve, it's great to have you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Fascinated by this conversation that we're about to have, but you write about how Democrats [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=52.56s)]
*  aren't taking this seriously enough and how they allowed Republicans to basically steamroll [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=57.56s)]
*  them in Virginia last year with their fears of critical race theory and the panic they [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=63.08s)]
*  were able to gin up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=68.08s)]
*  What other wake-up calls do the Democrats need at this point to get their act together? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=69.6s)]
*  Well, it's a good question in that it's been such a long-standing tried-and-true element [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=74.32s)]
*  of the right wing and of the conservatives and really the ideological heirs of the Confederacy [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=81.24s)]
*  who have really never stopped fighting the battle to have this be a country for straight [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=88.44s)]
*  white Christian men. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=94.16s)]
*  And so really, in my book, I talk about MAGA being Make America White Again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  So it's so long-standing, right? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=100.08s)]
*  You talked about the Central America Caravan issues back in 2018. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=102.08s)]
*  On this exact date, four years ago during the last midterms, Trump was tweeting about [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  this Central America Caravan, and that was on a Monday. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=113.0s)]
*  On the Friday of that week, the Robert Bowers and white man in Pittsburgh took his gun to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  Tree of Life Synagogue because he was alarmed by what Trump was saying and shot and killed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  many Jews in that synagogue, one of the worst massacres on our soil. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  So it's a long-standing tradition. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=133.68s)]
*  Nixon engaged in this back in 68 after Martin Luther King was killed, running a platform [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=137.76s)]
*  of law and order. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=142.28s)]
*  So by now, Democrats should be able to understand it and get it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=143.28s)]
*  What they don't understand is the country has changed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  This is really all about trying to inflame and scare and galvanize white people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  But the country in the 60s was only 12 percent people of color. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=154.88s)]
*  Now it's 40 percent. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=158.64s)]
*  And so now they need to call these things out for what they are, summon whites to take [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  a stand against this type of white fear mongering, and challenge people to rise to their highest [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  and best selves to be able to fight to make this a multiracial democracy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=172.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and people, in my opinion, falsely believe they say, oh, America has a long tradition [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=176.88s)]
*  of being a democracy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  And I push back on that sometimes because I think America has not been a true democracy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=185.04s)]
*  since everyone was allowed to vote. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=189.3s)]
*  And that wasn't until the 60s when women were allowed to vote, obviously before that, but [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=191.26s)]
*  then black and brown people were allowed to vote. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=194.7s)]
*  So we have not been a multiethnic, multiracial society and a democracy for that long. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=196.5s)]
*  When you think about it, are you at all surprised, you know, the polls citing 54 percent of strong [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=202.42s)]
*  Republicans believe a civil war is likely in the next decade because it kind of undercuts [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=210.26s)]
*  this notion that we're a long country with a long tradition of stability. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=214.74s)]
*  Well, you're quite correct. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=219.02s)]
*  We did not have democracy in this country until 1965, when LBJ and the Congress, after [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=219.98s)]
*  the Civil Rights Movement, and Jimmie Jackson and Reverend Reeve gave their lives to fight [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=225.7s)]
*  to actually get the Voting Rights Act passed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=231.74s)]
*  Until then, it was perfectly legal to exclude people of color from voting within this [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=234.22s)]
*  country, essentially. So how is that a democracy? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=239.02s)]
*  So we've only been at democracy since 1965, and people have been trying to undermine the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=242.3s)]
*  Voting Rights Act ever since. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=246.1s)]
*  And so you have this regard. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=248.5s)]
*  But fundamentally, it's that we don't appreciate how close we came to having actual [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  fascism in this country. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=256.54s)]
*  You can look up the definition about where a dictator refuses to leave power on January [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=257.78s)]
*  6th of 2021. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=262.42s)]
*  Yeah. And so we were on the precipice of this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=263.62s)]
*  And so this notion that we are far away from this, we have all these democratic traditions, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=265.98s)]
*  was teetering in the balance. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=270.94s)]
*  The majority of Republicans on January 6th voted to throw out the election of this country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=272.5s)]
*  So we are not far away from it at all. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=278.22s)]
*  What I fundamentally try to highlight for people to get the urgency of the situation is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=280.22s)]
*  that the Confederates and their heirs have never stopped fighting. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=285.18s)]
*  You had this segment earlier about defending the Confederate monuments. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=288.66s)]
*  The Confederates were white nationalist mass murderers who wanted to buy and sell people of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=292.3s)]
*  color. Why do we have monuments to them in this country? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=297.54s)]
*  Why are there monuments to them? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=301.02s)]
*  In the United States Capitol. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=302.22s)]
*  So this fundamental battle over whether this is primarily a white country, make America [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  white again, or is it a multiracial democracy, rages to this day. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=308.82000000000005s)]
*  Reverend Warnock had talked about how are we going to be a January 5th country where the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  successor to Martin Luther King is elected to the Senate? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=318.54s)]
*  Are we going to be a January 6th country? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  And that remains the battle that we're engaged in in this country. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=323.62s)]
*  Yeah, I know. It's absolutely brilliant the way you frame it like that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=326.86s)]
*  I wanted to get your reaction to this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=329.66s)]
*  You had the New York Attorney General, Letitia James and Governor Kathy Hockel releasing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=332.5s)]
*  this report just this week saying that fringe online platforms played a role in radicalizing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=337.38000000000005s)]
*  the Buffalo shooter who shot up a supermarket earlier this year in that in that hate crime. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=343.18s)]
*  Your reaction to that? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=349.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. So what the whole first half of my book, I talk about how the Confederates never [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=351.3s)]
*  stop fighting, starting with assassinating Lincoln five days after supposedly surrendering [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=355.7s)]
*  and all the way up through January 6th. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=361.18s)]
*  And I talk about how there's a consistent Confederate battle plan with multiple dimensions [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=363.14s)]
*  to it. And one of the elements of it, in addition to distorting public opinion and never [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=368.06s)]
*  giving an inch, is silently sanctioning terrorism. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=372.7s)]
*  And at every level, they've been silently sanctioning terrorism, sometimes not so silently as [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=375.78s)]
*  when Donald Trump told the Proud Boys, stand back and stand by in a national presidential [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=380.02s)]
*  debate. And as I was saying at the top, that the two, four years ago on this date, Trump [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=384.9s)]
*  began the fanning the flames that led to the white domestic terrorism that took place at [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=391.78s)]
*  Tree of Life Synagogue. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=397.78s)]
*  And so it's a longstanding core part of their battle plan is to inflame those who are on [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=399.14s)]
*  the fringes and are prone to violence. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=407.58s)]
*  And it really is a challenge to who is everybody else going to stand up for that and call it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=409.7s)]
*  out? Because when it's called out, that's when you actually have the greatest impact around [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=413.86s)]
*  stamping it out. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=418.42s)]
*  And yet even trying to call it out is hard when you have the GOP not letting up with their [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=419.3s)]
*  racist dog whistles in their attack ads. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=423.54s)]
*  I mean, the Bulk Work reported recently that you had Wisconsin State Republican Party [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=426.06s)]
*  sending out mailers that mailers that darken the skin of darken the skin color of Mandela [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=429.82s)]
*  Barnes, who is a black man running against Ron Johnson, a white man. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=436.1s)]
*  And it's just another result of racism that is now being emboldened and embraced by their [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=446.34s)]
*  Right. They're unrelenting. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=448.34s)]
*  Right. So when Antonio Delgado ran in New York in 2018, they were calling him a Los [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  Angeles rapper. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=456.21999999999997s)]
*  Right. And trying to invoke all of these different stereotypes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=457.14s)]
*  And as you had mentioned, the Virginia piece, this is what the Democrats need to understand, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=460.06s)]
*  is that the composition of the country has changed. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=463.34s)]
*  These are all longstanding attempts to inflame the passions of white people to be able to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=465.22s)]
*  support the Republicans. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=470.3s)]
*  But the white population is not as numerically dominant as it's historically been. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=472.38000000000005s)]
*  This is a far more multiracial country now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  And there's a meaningful minority of whites who will stand up against it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=479.46000000000004s)]
*  And that's what they failed to do in Virginia, is to respond to the CRT attacks by saying [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=483.58000000000004s)]
*  that, no, you're just trying to whitewash history and glorify white nationalism. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=488.66s)]
*  Instead, there was a very technical answer in trying to change the subject. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=493.90000000000003s)]
*  They're clearly leaning into these race-based attacks and the best way to refute them. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQqIslULgs&t=498.46000000000004s)]
