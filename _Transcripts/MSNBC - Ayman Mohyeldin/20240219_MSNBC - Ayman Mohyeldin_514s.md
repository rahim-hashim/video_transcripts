# 'It can occur anywhere': NV and IL attorneys general on gun violence epidemic
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY)
*  All right, so there are renewed calls to do something about America's gun epidemic after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=0.0s)]
*  the mass shooting this week at a Super Bowl parade in Kansas City that left at least one [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=5.36s)]
*  person dead. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  With that one person dead, 22 others injured. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Two minors have been charged and are currently being held at a juvenile detention center [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=14.66s)]
*  in connection with the shooting. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=19.32s)]
*  It all comes as a wave of gun safety laws took effect across the country at the beginning [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=21.1s)]
*  after 2023 ended with more mass shootings than days, believe it or not, having now the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=26.8s)]
*  second highest number on record. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=32.24s)]
*  The Gun Violence Archive has already tracked 51 mass shootings this year alone, and of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=34.76s)]
*  course I do not need to remind you that we are only in the middle of February. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=40.14s)]
*  And as the Trace notes, a newsroom dedicated to covering gun violence, these shootings [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=44.32s)]
*  happen so frequently in America that we are left feeling that they can happen anywhere [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=49.84s)]
*  at any time and without any warning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=55.64s)]
*  And that's because they actually do. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  The fact that mass shootings are still taking place despite the presence of police forces [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=60.4s)]
*  and even the scattered gun safety laws that do exist signals how deeply rooted this issue [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=65.44s)]
*  is in this country and the work that lies ahead. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=71.44s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this epidemic and more are Attorneys General Aaron Ford of Nevada [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=75.12s)]
*  and Kwame Raul of Illinois. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  Gentlemen, it's great to have both of you with us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time on this important topic. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=83.92s)]
*  Attorney General Raul, I'd like to start with you because I know that gun safety is personal [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=87.76s)]
*  for you as one of your own employees survived the Highland Park mass shooting back in 2022. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=91.48s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about what efforts you are leading in your state to address this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=97.52s)]
*  issue. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=101.2s)]
*  Yes, certainly. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=102.2s)]
*  Well, we know that the guns that are being used in gun violence in the communities most [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=104.2s)]
*  harmed by gun violence are neither manufactured there, legally sold there, or legally transferred [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=113.12s)]
*  into the hands of those who are perpetrating this gun violence. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=120.2s)]
*  So one of the things you mentioned, Kansas City, we partnered with the city of Kansas [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=124.48s)]
*  City to sue the ATF for relicensing a gun manufacturer that was making cheap guns that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=127.96s)]
*  were known to be used in crimes, carjackings, robberies, and so forth. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=136.96s)]
*  We were successful in getting the license of that gun manufacturer revoked. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=141.28s)]
*  That was a manufacturer specifically making guns, not for law-abiding gun owners, but [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=145.52s)]
*  for people that they knew would do harm with them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  We also partnered with every town, and we created a crime gun tracing platform so we [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=155.96s)]
*  can trace the flow of guns. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=162.52s)]
*  We prosecute gun trafficking cases, but we need the data to make sure that we can track [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  down those who are trafficking guns from other states into the state of Illinois and into [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  the city of Chicago, which is well known for its gun violence, unfortunately. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  And so our efforts towards gun violence recognize that there should never have been a place [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=182.96s)]
*  where we expected gun violence to occur. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  Now we are all up in arms because it can occur anywhere, but we've tolerated for decades [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=194.32s)]
*  gun violence happening in predominantly black and brown communities, and we tolerated the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=200.32s)]
*  things that aided that along. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=206.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's true, and it's also focused in the urban cities that people seem to think, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=208.48s)]
*  oh, if it's happening in the cities, it's not my problem. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=212.04s)]
*  Attorney General Ford, in 2022, you secured, I believe, $400,000 to go towards educating [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=214.92s)]
*  and training programs for your state's red flag law. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=220.68s)]
*  Talk to us about the progress that you've seen with this initiative and other steps [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  that your office is taking to protect your constituents and if we can expand it to other states. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=228.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, thanks so much for having Kwame and I on every time I have an [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  opportunity to serve on a panel with Kwame. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=239.0s)]
*  I'm delighted because I know we're going to be able to talk about some important stuff. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=242.68s)]
*  And you're right, we were able to secure $400,000 in the red flag training programs that we [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=246.72s)]
*  want implemented. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=251.72s)]
*  We are in the process of doing that, but that was just another step in a long line of efforts [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=252.72s)]
*  we've undertaken in Nevada to address gun violence issues dating back to my days in the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=257.36s)]
*  state Senate where we championed background check legislation, where although my predecessor [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=262.2s)]
*  did not want to enforce the background check legislation that was passed, we were able to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=267.52s)]
*  get it authorized and enforced. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=272.24s)]
*  Bumstock legislation that we passed in the aftermath of the October 1 shooting is another [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=274.96s)]
*  example. And we now have litigation ongoing right now where we are attempting to ban ghost [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=282.0s)]
*  gun legislation, ghost guns. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=286.16s)]
*  We have legislation that passed. We've been able to push back against some of the lawsuits [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=288.12s)]
*  against it, although we're still in court. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=292.04s)]
*  And, you know, although there have been some clearly misunderstandings around the prevalence [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  of ghost guns by some in our state, we know that at least from 2000, the summer of 2020 [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  to 2021, we had 250 of those covered by law enforcement that had been utilized in robberies [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=304.12s)]
*  or domestic violence or otherwise. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=310.36s)]
*  And so we're going to be working hard to ensure we can continue pushing back on the gun [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  violence epidemic that we see here in our state as well. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=316.2s)]
*  Mr. Oehl earlier today, Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost spoke with my colleague Alex [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  Witt about this issue. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  Take a listen to what he said. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=326.32s)]
*  So we got a lot of work to do. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  There's been good work that's been done. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=330.56s)]
*  The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act passed two years ago. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=332.04s)]
*  We've seen, especially in big cities, that gun violence rates has actually come down a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=334.92s)]
*  little bit. But we still have a lot of work to do because behind every number, there's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=338.48s)]
*  a human, there's a person. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  What do you think it's going to take for us to see a larger impact on this issue, to see [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=344.92s)]
*  the number of mass shootings in this country drastically drop? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=350.0s)]
*  Is this something that can only be done at a state level or a local level? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=354.04s)]
*  Or do you think the federal government has a role and can play a role in drastically [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  dropping this? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, I think it's got to be all hands on deck. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  And the federal government has to be involved. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=368.4s)]
*  And I think to some extent, to a great extent, the federal government has been involved under [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=371.28s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=376.4s)]
*  When I said earlier that I sued ATF, we're a great partner with ATF. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=378.0s)]
*  They have lent their crime gun intelligence towards solving the problem, certainly within [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=381.56s)]
*  the city of Chicago. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  But in addition, the Department of Justice has embraced the fact that we've got to get to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=389.12s)]
*  know the shooter. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=393.32s)]
*  What I mean by that is there's nobody who came out of the womb with a gun in their hand [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=394.76000000000005s)]
*  and are hard to take their neighbor. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=398.72s)]
*  We've got to intervene in the lives of people who are more likely to either be a victim or [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=400.6s)]
*  a perpetrator of gun violence. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=405.32000000000005s)]
*  We're not going to simply do it by passing gun laws or by way of enforcement. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=407.04s)]
*  We've got to realize we've got to invest in communities and into the lives of people that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=412.76000000000005s)]
*  would be vulnerable to choosing gun violence or otherwise being a victim of gun violence. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=417.6s)]
*  And Attorney General Ford, I'll give you the chance as well to weigh in on that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=423.44s)]
*  Do you think that there is a federal response here, a federal action that could be taken [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=426.64s)]
*  to drastically bring down these numbers, especially in the current climate where Washington is [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  so broken, for lack of a better word, or polarized, to say the least, on this issue? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=437.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=443.4s)]
*  I think there's a federal response that's necessary and appropriate. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=444.4s)]
*  I do commend the Biden administration for undertaking those efforts. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=446.64s)]
*  He does need a Congress that's willing to undertake these as well. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=450.59999999999997s)]
*  And so I commend, again, him for doing that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  But we have yet more work to do. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=456.12s)]
*  But as Kwame said, this is an all hands on deck approach. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  Just Friday, for example, I was at a panel discussion put on by a training rather put [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=460.84s)]
*  on by every town, Moms Demand Action in every town, where candidates who are advocating [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=465.76s)]
*  for common sense gun regulations are running for office. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's part of what we have to do as well, get people in office who have an appropriate [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  mindset about being responsible gun owners. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=479.48s)]
*  And that's another way that we can continue to drive down the currencies of gun violence [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=482.20000000000005s)]
*  in our country. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=486.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very important point to keep the political pressure on members of Congress [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=487.88s)]
*  as well to get the right candidates in with the right mindset. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVxPp2POkCY&t=491.28000000000003s)]
