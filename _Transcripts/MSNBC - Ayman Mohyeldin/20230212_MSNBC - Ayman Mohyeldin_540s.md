# Summer Lee blasts Oversight hearing, calls it a 'fundraising opportunity' for GOP
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA)
*  Republicans seem to be playing a one-sided game of limbo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=0.0s)]
*  Just how long can the GOP go here? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=8.6s)]
*  Well, this week, Republicans ignored advice from their new speaker to keep things civil [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=10.84s)]
*  at the State of the Union, instead pummeling President Biden with boos, heckles, and jeers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=14.88s)]
*  The chaos continued at a House Oversight Committee hearing, which was meant to examine Twitter's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=20.88s)]
*  handling of the Hunter Biden laptop news back in 2020. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=25.32s)]
*  And that's where some Republicans chose to treat the hearing as a proxy customer service [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=29.8s)]
*  line, chastising ex-Twitter employees for censoring their accounts. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=33.72s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=38.44s)]
*  You can consider your speech canceled during my time because you canceled mine. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=39.44s)]
*  You see, you permanently banned my personal Twitter account. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=45.2s)]
*  You silenced me from communicating with the American people over a freaking joke. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=49.16s)]
*  Now, who the hell do you think that you are? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=54.2s)]
*  All right, so remember, this hearing, which was more than two years in the making, was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=58.32s)]
*  supposed to center around accusations that Democrats somehow pressured Twitter to suppress [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=63.72s)]
*  content from conservatives. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=69.08s)]
*  That's what that whining was all about. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=71.28s)]
*  Instead, we learned that back in 2019, the Trump White House contacted Twitter to demand [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=73.4s)]
*  a tweet by supermodel Chrissy Teigen mocking Trump to be removed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=79.72s)]
*  As Congressman Jerry Connolly put it, watch. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=85.76s)]
*  My, my, my, what happens when you hold a hearing and you can't prove your point? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  And Republican dysfunction took center stage again this week at the inaugural hearing of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=94.92s)]
*  the House's so-called Weaponization Subcommittee. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  In a hearing the White House described as a Fox News reboot of McCarthyism, Republicans [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=103.0s)]
*  called on the expertise of friendly star witnesses like ex-Democrat-turned Tucker Carlson seat [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  warmer Tulsi Gabbard and two current GOP senators Chuck Grassley and conspiracy theorist Ron [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=114.44s)]
*  Johnson. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=121.52s)]
*  It played less like an investigative hearing and more like an indulgent four-hour live [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=122.52s)]
*  stream from the basement of a deep state conspiracy theorist. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=126.96s)]
*  As the Washington Post's Dana Milbank put it, the Weaponization Subcommittee will need [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=130.56s)]
*  just one thing to complete its work, quote, a scintilla of evidence. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=135.48s)]
*  That did not emerge this week. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=141.44s)]
*  Let's discuss with someone inside one of those hearing rooms, Democratic Congresswoman [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=143.32s)]
*  Summer Lee of Pennsylvania. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=146.88s)]
*  She's a member of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=148.56s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=153.2s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your time this evening. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=154.64s)]
*  So let me ask you, you know, when you were named to the Oversight Committee, is this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=156.0s)]
*  the kind of work you imagined yourself to be doing? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=160.74s)]
*  I mean, talk to us about what was going through your mind during Wednesday's hearing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=164.28s)]
*  I hate to say it, but, you know, I think I think we all knew what we signed up for when [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=170.48s)]
*  we when we got assigned to this committee. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=174.52s)]
*  You know, but I think that this this week's hearings were they were every bit as absurd [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=176.24s)]
*  as they play on TV. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=181.56s)]
*  I mean, we watched Republican members of this committee who, mind you, had more advance [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=183.48s)]
*  notice. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=189.24s)]
*  They were able to prepare better. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=190.24s)]
*  They came with the folks who they wanted here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=191.24s)]
*  And that was the showing that they put on. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=193.98s)]
*  It was it was frankly, it was embarrassing, but really it was also disrespectful. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=195.4s)]
*  We watched some of the witnesses be antagonized and disrespected and disparaged. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=199.38s)]
*  So it was it was really overwhelming a bit. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=207.06s)]
*  And I was going to say, you know, honestly, in between Marjorie Taylor Greene's whining [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=208.06s)]
*  and and Lauren Boebert, you know, Republicans spent their time, you know, airing their personal [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=210.98s)]
*  grievances. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=215.82s)]
*  There were some Democrats who actually tried to conduct actual oversight. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=216.82s)]
*  Your colleague, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was able to show that Twitter had literally [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=220.14s)]
*  changed its terms of service in order to avoid deleting a racist tweet by ex-president [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=224.8s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=230.56s)]
*  Wasn't this hearing supposed to be about a so-called bias against conservatives? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=231.56s)]
*  Because I saw the opposite. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=238.12s)]
*  I mean, how badly did the GOP's efforts backfire here, as Jerry Connolly was suggesting, Congressman [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  Jerry Connolly was suggesting? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=244.46s)]
*  I think completely. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  You know, when they went into this, the focus was supposed to be on their kind of two year [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=247.72000000000003s)]
*  campaign to convince the American people that, you know, something about the Hunter Biden [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=252.84s)]
*  investigation was hidden from them and that Democrats colluded with it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=256.72s)]
*  And what we actually ended up getting was evidence on the record rate that the kind [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=260.24s)]
*  of the conservative bias that they have been trying to perpetuate in the media is actually [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=266.96s)]
*  contrived and that it works right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=272.1s)]
*  We found out from Twitter, from folks who are on the panel who have worked with Twitter [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=274.92s)]
*  and other social media sites, that because they've continued to talk about conservative [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=278.84s)]
*  bias, they've continued to create it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=283.2s)]
*  So now we actually get the opposite effect, where we've made social media more unsafe, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=285.44s)]
*  that we've created a bias not on their behalf, but kind of on our behalf as they try to prove [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=290.0s)]
*  that they're not being biased against conservatives. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=295.2s)]
*  So with Donald Trump, we see that, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  We see where they go out of their way to give him more leeway. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=300.76s)]
*  But really, we've heard how this is unsafe, how we don't stop and investigate Twitter [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=303.96s)]
*  for hate speech, for speech that came before January 6th. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=308.72s)]
*  If we don't take those sorts of actions, we're going to continue to see blood. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=311.6s)]
*  We're going to continue to incite violence. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=314.48s)]
*  And that's what it's been used for. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  There's a bitter irony here that, you know, this week, Congressman James Comer, the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=318.48s)]
*  Republican chairman of the Oversight Committee, requested documents from President Biden's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=323.0s)]
*  son, Hunter Biden, his brother, James Biden, over their foreign business dealings. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=328.16s)]
*  Hunter Biden's lawyers have since rejected that request. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=333.48s)]
*  Since the committee wants to go down this rabbit hole of business dealings, when should [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  we expect Comer's request for records related to Jared Kushner's business dealings with [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=342.44s)]
*  Saudi Arabia? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=347.56s)]
*  I'm sure pretty I'm sure very soon. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  Certainly, it's on the way. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=352.6s)]
*  No, I mean, we know what they're trying to the only thing they're trying to uncover with [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=354.0s)]
*  these hearings are fundraising opportunities. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, do you think that they're weaponizing the same tactic of their playbook that we [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=361.32s)]
*  saw against Hillary Clinton weaponizing congressional oversight responsibilities and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=364.96s)]
*  committees to try to tarnish politicians of the opposition party? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. I think we we're going to we see it and we're going to continue to see it with [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  oversight. We see it with the weaponization of governments, select committee. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=377.08s)]
*  These are all opportunities for them to kind of use government, to use taxpayer dollars, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=383.2s)]
*  to actually weaponize government against their political enemies, against people who are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=388.44s)]
*  standing in their way. And really, they're using these committees, which are part of our [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=392.52s)]
*  legislative process, which are part of our government. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  They're using them as campaigns and really to kind of go about their campaigning. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=398.64s)]
*  All of these sham hearings that we hear, mind you, cost money. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  They were doing these at the expense of actual hearings that we could do to investigate [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  civil rights abuses like we've done in the past. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=412.68s)]
*  We can do those to investigate corporate waste and corporate greed. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=416.12s)]
*  So many things that are actually ailing American people. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=419.84s)]
*  And instead, we're using these to continue on with Republicans kind of shadowboxing with the Biden [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=422.0s)]
*  administration. Yeah, it is a real travesty. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=427.24s)]
*  I got to ask you, Congresswoman, before we go about some news from your home state, you previously [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=429.36s)]
*  served in the Pennsylvania State House on Tuesday. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  Democrats, they took the majority of that chamber for the first time in a dozen years after a lot of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=438.2s)]
*  several weeks, I should say, of people waiting for that to happen. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=443.56s)]
*  Talk to us about what this means for Pennsylvanians and what we can expect from a Democratic [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=445.88s)]
*  controlled chamber. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=451.44s)]
*  Yeah, this is so exciting. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=453.88s)]
*  Obviously, there was a lot of anticipation about this, particularly as we came out of November races [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=455.28s)]
*  where we didn't expect to have success, right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  Success at the state level. This is the first time in over a decade that we will have a majority in the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  House. That means that we were able to block so many harmful things that the Republicans wanted to run. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  Abortion bans in the Commonwealth, more democracy disenfranchisement instead of democracy [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=473.12s)]
*  reform they wanted to run through and so many other harmful things. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=480.48s)]
*  So in addition to be able to block those, we also now get a majority where we're able to run on [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=483.44s)]
*  things that really matter to American people. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=488.88s)]
*  We're able to protect labor rights and workers rights. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvCgIeIPAA&t=490.8s)]
