# George Conway: 'Trumpism has metastasized'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM)
*  Good morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's now George Conway, attorney and contributing columnist to the Washington Post. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=1.0s)]
*  George, good to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=6.0s)]
*  People across America were busy scanning you because I told them to scan the screen and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=7.16s)]
*  then you came up in the T's. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=10.24s)]
*  So a lot of people got you on their phone now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=11.88s)]
*  George, let's talk about this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=14.68s)]
*  One of the things that is interesting about the indictment of Donald Trump, the document [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=16.88s)]
*  is really interesting. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=20.88s)]
*  You're a lawyer. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=21.88s)]
*  You probably read it in great detail. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=23.0s)]
*  But the response from Republicans has been really unified. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=24.96s)]
*  There's this whole thing about the weaponization of the Department of Justice against Donald [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=29.6s)]
*  Trump, broadly about Republicans and conservatives. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=33.04s)]
*  I can't imagine it works. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=36.36s)]
*  I was chatting with Simone about this, but it must because they're all doing it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=38.28s)]
*  It's mind boggling to me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=43.32s)]
*  I mean, it is another depth to which Republicans who defend Trump have sunk. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=44.56s)]
*  I mean, it is just absolutely absurd that if any Democrat had done one tenth of what [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=50.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is alleged to have done here, and I know they cite Hillary Clinton, but [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=58.56s)]
*  she did one fiftieth thousandth of not even that of what happened here, the Republicans [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  would be screaming for a criminal prosecution and they'd be right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  So I just think that, you know, I mean, it is just clearly politically motivated and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=75.36s)]
*  just shamelessly so. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=79.44s)]
*  I mean, these people, a lot of them, Speaker McCarthy, I don't think he even waited to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=80.44s)]
*  see and to read the indictment. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you open the indictment to almost any page, any paragraph, there's enough there [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=86.6s)]
*  for for for espionage at charge or an obstruction charge beyond any reasonable doubt. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=91.0s)]
*  I mean, the evidence is actually just laid out in the indictment in a way that you don't [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=96.84s)]
*  often see. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=100.36s)]
*  Hey, George, it's Jonathan Capehart. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=101.8s)]
*  And so then so what's it going to take? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  What do you think it's going to take to break that lockstep that Republicans have when it [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=106.24s)]
*  comes to Donald Trump defending him, saying it's saying, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=112.36s)]
*  He says the sky is blue. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=118.0s)]
*  The sky is red. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=119.56s)]
*  And they lock, march, step, lockstep behind him and agree that the sky is red, even though [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=120.68s)]
*  they know it isn't. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=125.92s)]
*  Oh, I, you know, I mean, I think it's going to take more of the kind of. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=128.16s)]
*  Straightforwardness that we are now seeing from Chris Christie, although he has disappointed [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=133.92s)]
*  in the past and from Asa Hutchinson and Liz Cheney and those. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=140.12s)]
*  But I say there are just precious few people willing to do that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you think about it, I mean, like Pence, you know, he put out an ad the other day that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  was actually pretty good about the rule of law. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=153.28s)]
*  And from time to time, you hear him say things that are actually helpful, although, you know, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=156.0s)]
*  he also often backtracks on them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=161.68s)]
*  And he is possibly he is also partly responsible for what happened on January 6 because of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=164.12s)]
*  his inaction before January 6. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=169.32s)]
*  That said, I mean, I mean, a guy like him, if I were, you know, a semi-shameless Republican [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=171.72s)]
*  candidate president, I'd I'd I'd take the following view to try to persuade people to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=177.76s)]
*  to to get off the Trump train. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=184.04s)]
*  I'd say, you know, are we are we is is there a tape delay? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=185.84s)]
*  Because I might puke if I do say this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=191.48s)]
*  But I would say I would say I'd say, you know, I mean, I'm a believer in Jesus Christ [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=196.44s)]
*  and and I know Donald Trump is a good man to the depth of his soul and he is a good [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  Christian. But, you know, we are all sinners. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=208.56s)]
*  We are all get carried away sometimes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=211.48s)]
*  And sometimes we do things that are wrong. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=213.72s)]
*  And and here, you know, I mean, Donald Trump, they are out to get him. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=217.28s)]
*  They have been mean to him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=221.76s)]
*  They have been terrible to him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=223.0s)]
*  Awful, absolutely awful. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=226.84s)]
*  And I agree. I mean, he has been persecuted by the by the by the left wing media and and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=228.96s)]
*  the woke mob. But. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=235.24s)]
*  He's making it easier for them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=237.96s)]
*  I mean, he just gets carried away and we need to just basically get off that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=240.36s)]
*  I mean, he's he did such a great job as president, but we it's just not going to happen [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=246.08s)]
*  again. So we need to move on. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=251.64s)]
*  And and I love Donald Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=254.27999999999997s)]
*  I know he's going to get mad at me for saying this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  I love Donald Trump. I will love him to death no matter what he says about me. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=258.28s)]
*  But, you know, in my Christian soul, I believe we just have to move on. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=262.12s)]
*  That's that's that's the kind of thing you could get if you get some. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  Maybe Mike Pence do something like that, as sickening as it sounds, and a couple and a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  little bunch of people to do that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  Maybe you move enough people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=277.76s)]
*  But the problem is, you know, you've got like, you know, how many people do you have [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  running in that primary? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  It's just not going to, you know, he's they're all splitting the anti-Trump vote. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  So I don't know whether there are going to be enough voters who are going to coalesce [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=291.44s)]
*  behind a single candidate who is going to beat Trump. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  And the fact is, with the way the delegate system is set up, you don't need a majority [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=298.28s)]
*  of of the primary voters to win. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  So I know Alicia has a has a question, George. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  I just want to know when you have a future. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=308.4s)]
*  Anyone needs to call George Conway. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  I think he's available to play Mike Pence in debate. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=312.2s)]
*  Exactly. I'm just going to click that for my show at 4 p.m. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=314.88s)]
*  tomorrow. So you'll see yourself in an accent. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=318.52s)]
*  That was a southern accent. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=320.64s)]
*  I defer to my colleague, Alicia Menendez. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. I think part of what is interesting to us, I think part of what's interesting [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=324.96s)]
*  to us, George, is the fact that this was a party that used to pride itself on national [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=329.32s)]
*  security. This was a party that used to pride itself on the rule of law. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=334.8s)]
*  David Jolly earlier made the argument to me this is a post ideology party. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. There's no core ideology. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=343.44s)]
*  If there is to be a Republican Party of the future and the Republican leaders of this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=345.8s)]
*  moment have looked the other way on national security, they have looked the other way on [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=350.44s)]
*  the rule of law. What then is left for the party to build itself upon? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's a problem. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=360.8s)]
*  I mean, this the Trumpism has metastasized. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=362.16s)]
*  I mean, if it had been cut out earlier in 2017 or 2018, as I, you know, I had always [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=366.52s)]
*  hoped that sooner or later people would say, Basta, I mean, oh, come on, stop it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=372.68s)]
*  And that would be basically Trump's support would collapse like a like a failing bridge. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=378.0s)]
*  But that's never happened. I mean, we've been you know, that was my hope for that was, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, two impeachments, two indictments, an attempted coup and, you know, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=388.8s)]
*  Clorox shots of many shots ago. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=394.88s)]
*  And I just don't see it happening. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=398.48s)]
*  Even even with this indictment, I know other people are a little more hopeful. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=400.68s)]
*  I know I know that Mike Murphy tweeted something the other day saying he thinks that, you [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=404.16s)]
*  know, when people get to the voting booths in New Hampshire and Iowa, they're going to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=408.04s)]
*  say, I can't deal with this anymore. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=412.32s)]
*  They're going to pull the lever for somebody else. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=414.04s)]
*  But again, I mean, with with all of the candidates splitting the vote so many ways, I'm [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=416.32s)]
*  not sure who it is who's going to take the mantle away from Trump. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=420.84s)]
*  And it's got to be somebody who's going to be willing to go after him, even in the even [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  in the asinine way. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=429.96s)]
*  I just pretended to. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=431.88s)]
*  George, thanks as always. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=434.76s)]
*  We love hearing from you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate it. George Conway. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgJmoADZIhM&t=437.12s)]
