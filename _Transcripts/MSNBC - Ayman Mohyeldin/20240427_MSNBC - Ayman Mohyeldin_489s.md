# Trump’s 'absolute' immunity case & campus protests mark inflection point for U.S. Constitution
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI)
*  This week marked an inflection point in our nation's history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=0.0s)]
*  The United States Constitution being tested in new and dangerous ways. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=5.2s)]
*  On Thursday, former President Donald Trump and his lawyers went to the U.S. Supreme Court [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=9.82s)]
*  to double down on claims that a president possesses sweeping immunity from criminal [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=14.18s)]
*  prosecution. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=20.42s)]
*  Basically, according to the ex-president's lawyers, his immunity is so absolute, they [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=21.42s)]
*  argued, that even assassinating a political rival could be within the official powers [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=26.619999999999997s)]
*  of the presidency. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=33.22s)]
*  If the president decides that his rival is a corrupt person and he orders the military [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=35.86s)]
*  or orders someone to assassinate him, is that within his official acts for which he can [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=47.26s)]
*  get immunity? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=54.34s)]
*  It would depend on the hypothetical, but we can see that could well be an official act. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=55.46s)]
*  Could well be an official act. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=59.7s)]
*  Just imagine how ridiculous that sounds here for a minute, because if you apply Trump's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=62.7s)]
*  lawyers' logic, they are basically saying that the current president, Joe Biden, could [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=68.18s)]
*  kill his political opponent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=74.38s)]
*  I don't know, maybe someone like Donald Trump, who he believes possesses a clear and present [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=75.9s)]
*  danger to our democracy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=81.34s)]
*  And that could potentially be considered an official act immune from prosecution. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=83.78s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=90.3s)]
*  While Trump is asking the Supreme Court to put the presidency above criminal law, the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=91.3s)]
*  GOP presumptive nominee is pursuing an even broader authoritarian agenda behind the scenes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=96.42s)]
*  Should he win a second term, Trump and his allies are laying the groundwork to eliminate [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=102.58s)]
*  internal checks and balances on the executive branch, a system laid out by the founders [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=107.78s)]
*  in our constitution and instead centralize even more power in the presidency. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=112.54s)]
*  So on one hand, we have this top down approach to authoritarianism, where Trump is plotting [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=119.5s)]
*  a dictatorship that starts from the office of the presidency all the way down. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=124.78s)]
*  And on the other hand, this week, we saw another attack on our constitutional norms in the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=130.34s)]
*  wake of mass anti-war Palestinian solidarity protests at college campuses across the country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=135.3s)]
*  Republicans began calling on President Biden to unleash the full force of the National [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  Guard on demonstrators. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=145.66s)]
*  My intention is to call President Biden after we leave here and share with him what we have [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=148.34s)]
*  seen with our own two eyes and demand that he take action. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=153.42s)]
*  There is executive authority that be appropriate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=156.38s)]
*  If this is not contained quickly and if these threats and intimidation are not stopped, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=159.1s)]
*  there is an appropriate time for the National Guard. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=164.04s)]
*  The National Guard, in case you don't know, is activated and commanded by the governors [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=167.46s)]
*  of their respective states. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=171.24s)]
*  However, under the Insurrection Act, a president does have the power to federalize these forces. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=173.06s)]
*  The Republicans are calling on the president to take this extraordinary action despite [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=178.9s)]
*  the fact that we have yet to see any evidence of mass violence or unrest that would justify [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=183.46s)]
*  such an extreme move. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  In fact, much of whatever violence we have seen on college campuses has been at the hands [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=190.86s)]
*  of over-militarized police, those who are called in to help disperse the protests. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=196.72s)]
*  Images and videos of police violently arresting peaceful protesters has flooded social media. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=202.08s)]
*  Take for example at Emory University, heavily armed officers can be seen tasing a demonstrator [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=208.48s)]
*  who was already handcuffed and on the ground. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=213.2s)]
*  And here you can see police slamming economics professor Caroline Follan into the concrete [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=216.72s)]
*  after she expressed concern at the violent arrest of another protester. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=222.44s)]
*  American politicians have tried to justify the use of such force by labeling these college [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  students and professors as pro-Hamas or even terrorists. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=232.76s)]
*  And here is what these protesters really are. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  Students and professors using their First Amendment constitutional rights to protest [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=241.52s)]
*  the actions of the American government, which is helping fund what they say is Israel's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=246.36s)]
*  genocidal war on Palestinians. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=251.48s)]
*  Students who pay thousands of dollars in tuition to these universities every year demanding [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=254.6s)]
*  a say in how that money, their money, is being used, asking for divestment in any business [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=259.24s)]
*  that profits from the ongoing war and an end to that war. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=265.68s)]
*  And they have every right to do so. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=270.56s)]
*  Public officials in this country do not get to advocate for the forceful suppression of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=273.32s)]
*  citizens just because they disagree with them or even dislike how they protest. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=277.44s)]
*  As Lydia Paul Green writes in the New York Times, these protests have shown just how [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=283.04s)]
*  unsettling some aspects of activism can be. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=287.68s)]
*  Paul Green, who has been reporting on the scene at Columbia University, noted that she [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=291.08s)]
*  had witnessed anti-Semitic scenes outside the bounds of the campus. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  But she also writes this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=299.88s)]
*  It doesn't mean the protesters' actions are misguided. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=301.28s)]
*  These young people seek a worthy cause to end what may be the most brutal military operation [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=304.68s)]
*  for civilians in the 21st century. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=310.72s)]
*  Just imagine here for a moment if a United States president, perhaps someone like Donald [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=314.16s)]
*  Trump, buys into this label being pinned on these students, that they are in fact terrorists. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=318.56s)]
*  Does that mean a U.S. president with his expanded powers could use drones to attack these students [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  the way that we have been droning terrorists all over the world? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=332.12s)]
*  Now that might sound hyperbolic to you, but under Trump's definition of absolute immunity, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  is anything truly off the table? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, so far, President Biden has rejected calls to intervene in these protests, but [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=343.56s)]
*  it's not like the U.S. does not have a dark history of sending in the military to tamp [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  down campus protests. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=352.68s)]
*  On May 4th, 1970, the Ohio governor at the time then called the National Guard to Kent [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  State University in response to student protests over the Vietnam War. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=359.56s)]
*  After demonstrators refused to disperse, troops opened fire on the protesters, killing four [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=363.88s)]
*  people and wounding nine others. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  Here's how one student described the scene to NBC News that very day. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=371.24s)]
*  Next thing I know, shots were fired. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  Jumped behind this car and some kids yelled, they were live bullets because a car window [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=379.28s)]
*  shattered. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=383.28s)]
*  Finally it was over and I got up to run away. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=384.28s)]
*  This guy, you know, oh my God, this girl is shot and he picks her up and she has this [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=386.96s)]
*  bloody spot on her jacket and there's blood coming out of her mouth. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=391.0s)]
*  Before that I was angry that the guards were here and I wanted, you know, this is my campus, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=394.4s)]
*  I have a right to be here. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=398.23999999999995s)]
*  I felt like we'd been invaded and they were sort of pushing us around and everything, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=399.32s)]
*  but afterwards I was just afraid. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=403.96s)]
*  So in the wake of these latest protests and the violent response from police, Laurel Krauss, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=406.64s)]
*  a sister of 19 year old Allison Krauss, who was killed by the National Guard on that day, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  urged officials not to repeat history. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=416.76s)]
*  Quote, our institutions must learn from these past mistakes to not use militarized responses [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  against unarmed peaceful student protesters. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=425.88s)]
*  However, five decades later, it seems that our institutions are facing this unprecedented [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  test. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=434.08s)]
*  If we normalize this kind of militarized response to peaceful protesters that are labeled as [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  terrorists, if we continue to ignore why they have resorted to protests on campus in the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=440.2s)]
*  first place and off campus, and if the power of the executive branch that we saw this week [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=445.56s)]
*  being tested so that a sitting president like Trump is immune from criminal wrongdoing and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=450.88s)]
*  answers to no one, as he argued at the Supreme Court, then what happened to Allison Krauss [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=456.08s)]
*  and those other students could certainly happen again. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=461.92s)]
*  We cannot and must not let that happen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDt1U3tQmI&t=466.16s)]
