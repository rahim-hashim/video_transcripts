# The fight for democracy in Wisconsin as seat opens in the state’s Supreme Court
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE)
*  I want to bring to your attention a high-stakes election you probably haven't heard much [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=0.0s)]
*  about, but it could have massive implications for democracy in this country, as we know [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=8.24s)]
*  it, and possibly the outcome of the next presidential election. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=13.4s)]
*  That is not hyperbolic. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=17.0s)]
*  This Tuesday in Wisconsin, primary voting will take place to begin the process of determining [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=18.52s)]
*  the person who will replace a conservative justice on that state's Supreme Court. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=23.62s)]
*  Now, the court currently leans right with a four-to-three conservative majority, but [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  come April, when the general election takes place, that could all change. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=33.2s)]
*  And it could have a big impact on some of the most contentious issues that court will [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  rule on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=42.96s)]
*  Consider some of the state's court's recent rulings. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=43.96s)]
*  In a decision last year, the court effectively banned the use of ballot drop boxes, and that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  was after it had ruled in favor of new Republican-drawn legislative maps. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=53.2s)]
*  Those maps are coming under renewed scrutiny after it was recently revealed that a Republican [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=58.6s)]
*  member of the State Elections Commission, which drew those maps, said the quiet part [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=62.72s)]
*  out loud. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Writing in an email, Republicans can be especially proud of the city of Milwaukee casting 37,000 [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  less votes than cast in the 2018 election, with the major reduction happening in the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=75.88s)]
*  overwhelming black and Hispanic areas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=82.28s)]
*  State Gov. Tony Evers has signaled action directing his election lawyers to ask the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=87.48s)]
*  court to invalidate the current map if the open court seat goes to a liberal-leaning [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=92.08s)]
*  justice. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  The election could also determine the fate of Wisconsin's near-total abortion ban, which [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  was originally enacted back in, wait for it, 1849, and is currently the law of the land [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  since last year's Dobs decision. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  State Attorney General Josh Call filed a lawsuit alleging that the ancient law is unenforceable [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=112.4s)]
*  and it could very well make its way to, you guessed it, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  And that man, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Call, joins me now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=124.68s)]
*  Mr. Attorney General, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  I greatly appreciate your time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  Let's start here with the big picture, if I can. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  The chair of the State Democratic Party, Ben Wickler, has called this race the most critical [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=135.24s)]
*  election of 2023, both for Wisconsin and for American democracy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the upcoming election? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=146.0s)]
*  Was I being hyperbolic in my characterization of it? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, first, thanks for having me back in the program, Eamon. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  And Chairman Wickler is exactly right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=154.8s)]
*  This is the most important election in America this year. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=156.56s)]
*  We have a primary this coming Tuesday, and then there will be a general election early [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=159.8s)]
*  in April. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  But the Wisconsin Supreme Court is on a knife's edge. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  There's a one-vote conservative majority currently. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  This election is going to determine whether we continue to have a conservative majority [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=171.24s)]
*  or whether there's a shift in the majority in the court. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  And that's vitally important on so many issues in Wisconsin. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  And as you know, what happens in Wisconsin impacts the whole country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  We've been the tipping point state in the last two presidential elections, and having [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  members of our Supreme Court who are committed to protecting our democracy is going to be [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=189.44s)]
*  vital. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=193.28s)]
*  The race, as I mentioned, as you've suggested, it has attracted unprecedented amounts of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=194.44s)]
*  national attention. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=199.12s)]
*  The spending so far, just for the primary, has already topped $6 million in ads. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=200.12s)]
*  The general election, it doesn't happen until April 4th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=205.12s)]
*  It could end up being the most expensive race in the nation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=208.08s)]
*  What does that tell you about just what's at stake? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=212.8s)]
*  Well, it's a reflection of how big the stakes are. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  And you can really see that by looking at some of the four to three decisions we've [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  seen from our state Supreme Court. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=222.4s)]
*  You just highlighted a few of them, but prohibiting the use of most absentee ballot drop boxes, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=224.44s)]
*  that was a four to three decision. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=229.68s)]
*  Putting in place really extreme partisan gerrymanders for both our congressional maps and our state [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=231.52s)]
*  legislative maps. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  Those were four to three decisions. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=238.44s)]
*  Allowing a Scott Walker appointee to stay on until the Republican State Senate confirmed [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  a replacement, that was a four to three decision. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=246.36s)]
*  And if you go back to 2020, we were one of the states at the center of Donald Trump's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=249.4s)]
*  efforts to overturn the results of the election. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  My office defended those cases in court, and we won every single one of them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=256.88s)]
*  But in most states, those cases were laughed out of court. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=261.26000000000005s)]
*  In Wisconsin, there was a four to three state Supreme Court decision. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=264.58000000000004s)]
*  But we prevented the election from really being thrown into chaos. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  That's not the kind of margin we want to see when it comes to our democracy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=273.86s)]
*  So electing one of the candidates here who believes in equal justice under the law and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  our democracy and will equally apply the laws is critical. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought up what happened in your state in 2020, because the big concern [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=285.98s)]
*  is among the other issues that impact your state, if a conservative leaning justice [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=290.34s)]
*  does in fact win this race, how concerned are you, should we be, about what this could [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  mean for the next presidential election in 2024? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think we should all be concerned. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=306.46s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to be on the ballot again. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=307.82s)]
*  We all know what happened following the 2020 presidential election, and he is promoting [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=310.02s)]
*  folks around the country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=315.38s)]
*  He just endorsed a state Senate candidate who's an election denier in a state Senate [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  special election here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=321.62s)]
*  There is a real possibility that there is going to be another effort to overturn the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=323.3s)]
*  results of our elections in 2024 and having our court system hold people in key elected [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=326.98s)]
*  offices stand up for our democracy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=334.3s)]
*  It could very well be just as critical in 2024 as it was in 2020. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  And the Supreme Court election we have coming up is one of the crucial elections as we [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=340.82s)]
*  look ahead to what may happen down the road. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=345.42s)]
*  Let me ask you about abortion in your state. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=347.82s)]
*  Last year, we saw the results of the Kansas abortion referendum. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=349.46000000000004s)]
*  Voters overwhelmingly voted against making abortion illegal in a traditionally conservative [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=353.3s)]
*  state. With your lawsuit in the pipeline, with its potential final destination being [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=358.26s)]
*  the state Supreme Court again, how do you see abortion factoring into this race? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's already become an issue in the state Supreme Court race. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=371.42s)]
*  It certainly was a major issue in our governor's race and in my reelection, which just [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=375.1s)]
*  happened this past November. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  I think it was one of the key issues in our being successful, both Governor Evers and me, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=381.82000000000005s)]
*  because we were very clear that we are going to fight to restore access to safe and legal [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  abortion in the Supreme Court race. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=390.46000000000004s)]
*  We've seen the two conservative candidates be endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=392.70000000000005s)]
*  One of the conservative candidates said that she supported the overturning of Roe v. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=398.02000000000004s)]
*  Wade and thinks that Dobbs was correctly decided. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=402.58s)]
*  So there's no question that this is going to be an important issue in this race. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=405.41999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, our Supreme Court addresses issues across the spectrum. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=409.46s)]
*  And so the results of this election are going to have an impact on so many different issues [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=413.38s)]
*  here in Wisconsin and because of Wisconsin's significant national picture, in turn, on the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=418.53999999999996s)]
*  national political picture as well. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=423.7s)]
*  Can I ask you about these Republican drawn legislative maps and whether or not there is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=425.38s)]
*  any possible now that there is renewed scrutiny given the emails that have emerged, is there any [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=430.3s)]
*  possible course of action that can be taken to undo these legislative maps? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=434.86s)]
*  I certainly think it's possible that we're going to see more legal action regarding the maps. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  The way this played out was that the governor proposed maps. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=446.7s)]
*  My office represented him. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=450.42s)]
*  We advocated for the adoption of the maps the governor proposed. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=451.82s)]
*  The state Supreme Court set a very restrictive standard initially saying that they were going [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=455.18s)]
*  to take the map that had the fewest changes from the prior maps, which were themselves [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=459.34000000000003s)]
*  gerrymandered. The governor initially won on some of those maps, but the U.S. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=463.94s)]
*  Supreme Court threw them out. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=469.14s)]
*  But there are a lot of issues that have not yet been litigated that I think very well could be [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwhTPBWt6JE&t=470.86s)]
