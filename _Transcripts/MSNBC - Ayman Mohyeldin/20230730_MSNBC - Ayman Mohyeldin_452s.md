# Rep. Zoe Lofgren on Richard Nixon vs. Donald Trump
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw)
*  The latest charges against Donald Trump and his aides make it very likely the current [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=0.0s)]
*  May 2024 trial date will be pushed back. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=6.92s)]
*  As NBC News senior correspondent, legal correspondent Laura Jarrett reports, the destruction of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=9.92s)]
*  videotape evidence means more discovery from prosecutors, which means more opportunities [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=14.64s)]
*  to file motions to delay, meaning accountability, at least in this instance, could actually [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=20.16s)]
*  come later than expected. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=26.16s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman Zoe Loughran of California. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=28.4s)]
*  Of course, she served on the January 6th House Select Committee. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=31.64s)]
*  Congresswoman, it is great to see you again. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=35.08s)]
*  Thanks for coming back on the show. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=36.56s)]
*  Let me just get your reaction to these new charges and the superseding indictment. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=38.96s)]
*  Obviously, you have been behind the scenes investigating Trump's actions leading up to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=42.44s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=47.56s)]
*  Was there anything that surprised you as you saw the news come out this week? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  Well, I guess a lot of us were expecting January 6th indictment based on the target letter [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=55.2s)]
*  timing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=62.0s)]
*  But honestly, I was shocked by the new charges, the superseding indictment down on the documents [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=63.0s)]
*  case. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=71.08s)]
*  I was just a staffer when the Nixon impeachment was going on, but it's the cover-up that gets [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=72.08s)]
*  you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=78.68s)]
*  And these allegations and the indictment are very serious. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=79.84s)]
*  If proven, I think the ex-president is in serious illegal jeopardy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=85.92s)]
*  So let me ask you about that, because as you just mentioned and as we talked about, there's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=91.84s)]
*  a lot of similarities between Nixon and Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=96.72s)]
*  You actually worked, as you just mentioned, on the Nixon impeachment as a law student [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=99.16s)]
*  in 1974 on then Congressman Don Edward Staff. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  And you also worked on Trump's impeachments, both of them, I should note. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=107.92s)]
*  How do these two moments in history compare? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  What did you learn through working on Nixon's impeachment that you were able to bring to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=114.16s)]
*  Trump's? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=118.88s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because what I learned was really more about the Republican Party [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=119.88s)]
*  than the presidents who got themselves in trouble. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=126.84s)]
*  When the truth came out about Nixon, it was irrefutable. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=130.78s)]
*  Republican members of the House and Senate were shocked. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=135.68s)]
*  They were ashamed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  And they went to the president and said, your support is gone. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=140.88s)]
*  You've got to leave. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  What's happening now, the current Republican Party leadership, at least, and most of even [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=146.28s)]
*  those members who don't agree don't speak up, there is no shame. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=151.8s)]
*  The truth is just dispensed with. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Lies are just a strategy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=160.8s)]
*  It's a very different approach to the world and a very different sense of honor than was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  the case when Nixon was in trouble and his impeachment out of the Judiciary Committee. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=168.52s)]
*  To your point earlier, I think a lot of people were expecting this week's announcement to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=176.08s)]
*  include an indictment on January the 6th. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=179.22000000000003s)]
*  And look, it's very possible it might happen, given the target letter, a possible indictment [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  in the ex-president's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=186.96s)]
*  And of course, we're still waiting to see what happens in Georgia with Fannie Willis, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=190.24s)]
*  the DA there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=193.36s)]
*  In a piece you wrote for MSNBC.com that you've called Trump's election schemes, quote, the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  gravest threat to the constitutional order in modern history. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Expand on that and what happens if there is no accountability for trying to overturn an [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=204.74s)]
*  election. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=210.44s)]
*  Well, essentially, Trump tried to overturn the Constitution. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=213.44s)]
*  I mean, Richard Nixon corruptly used instruments of the government, but he wasn't on a mission [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=219.36s)]
*  to overturn the Constitution itself. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  That's what Trump tried to do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=229.36s)]
*  And it's worth noting, he has said that he intends, if he's re-elected, to terminate [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=231.08s)]
*  aspects of the Constitution, which is, I mean, a stunning statement. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=238.68s)]
*  And I've learned, as we went into this investigation, to pay attention to what Trump says, because [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=243.36s)]
*  it's what he intends to do. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=249.96s)]
*  He intends to, he said, terminate parts of the Constitution. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=252.24s)]
*  And he's been very overt about taking to the presidency authorities that don't belong to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=257.86s)]
*  that branch of government. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  Really, it's a very ominous set of predictions that he's making, should he be elected. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=266.56s)]
*  I think we ought to pay attention to it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=276.64s)]
*  I think he means what he says. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=278.24s)]
*  Let me ask you about what we played earlier on the show. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=280.48s)]
*  I'm not sure if you heard it, but it was Donald Trump in an interview saying that he is not [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=282.52s)]
*  going to stop no matter what happens on the legal front. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm curious to get your thoughts on where this may be going in terms of what accountability, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=289.56s)]
*  what justice looks like. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=295.28s)]
*  In this piece that you wrote for MSNBC.com, you write about how the January 6th committee's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=297.55999999999995s)]
*  work may be one of the most significant in American history, noting that you and your [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=302.2s)]
*  fellow Congress members may have very well pressured the Justice Department to take action. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=306.28s)]
*  And in your view, what would it look like for Trump to finally face justice? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, I do think it's important that it's not just the foot soldiers that are brought to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=319.2s)]
*  justice. I mean, the Department of Justice has indicted and convicted a whole number, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=324.28s)]
*  hundreds of individuals who rioted and who attacked the police and the like. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=332.0s)]
*  But until these this target letter, there wasn't a strong indication that the insider in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=336.67999999999995s)]
*  chief, the plotters were actually going to be held to account, not just those who they [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  incited. I think that's important. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  There needs to be accountability at all levels, not just the people who did the violence at [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=354.44s)]
*  his behest. I do think his comment that he would run for president from prison is an [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=360.2s)]
*  astonishing one and really, I guess, shows the difference between the parties. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the Republican Party is conservative or used to be, but it was a conservative [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=373.8s)]
*  party that had a sense of honor, just like the Democrats had a sense of honor. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=380.2s)]
*  That appears to be gone now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  And his threats are, I think, a pretty shocking one. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=386.56s)]
*  And the fact that he's continuing to lie to his supporters and that many of them don't [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=391.28s)]
*  have a source of actual news and they buy it is ominous as well. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=397.56s)]
*  A lot of innocent people were harmed in January six. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  People who believed him. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=407.56s)]
*  And that's happening again. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=409.96s)]
*  Yeah. And to Michelle Goldberg's earlier point, I mean, he has managed to seal off the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  Republican Party from reality. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=416.64s)]
*  And that's where we find ourselves today, a party that just doesn't believe in reality. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=418.44s)]
*  Congressman Zoloft, it's always a pleasure. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=422.76s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time and your insights. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnKyTE6Aekw&t=424.52s)]
