# Oregon Governor Tina Kotek’s fight to preserve abortion access
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE)
*  All right, so despite the attack after attack from right-wing judges, McPeper Stone remains [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=0.0s)]
*  safe and legal for the moment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  The Supreme Court just allowed access to the abortion pill to continue while a challenge [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=9.34s)]
*  to the FDA's approval plays out, returning the case to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=13.42s)]
*  meaning that the status quo for McPeper Stone access will likely remain in place through [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=19.26s)]
*  the fall and perhaps well into next year. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=24.46s)]
*  And let's be clear here, anything short of preserving access to this FDA-approved drug [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=26.94s)]
*  would have set a dangerous precedent where one rogue, extremely far-right judge anywhere [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=32.14s)]
*  in this country could basically strip away access to a safe and effective medication [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=36.36s)]
*  abortion pill for millions of Americans. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=40.88s)]
*  The fight is not over. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=44.42s)]
*  The legal case is still pending. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=45.82s)]
*  And extremist Republicans, especially at the state level, continue to strip women of their [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  rights to make their own health care decisions. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=52.2s)]
*  Now, one of the leaders that is pushing back against the GOP at the state level is Oregon [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=54.78s)]
*  Governor Tina Kotec. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=59.82s)]
*  The Democrat just announced her state has acquired a three-year supply of McPeper Stone, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=61.34s)]
*  and she wants to make it clear to Oregon residents, patients in Oregon will have access to the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=65.98s)]
*  medication for years to come. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=72.1s)]
*  I spoke with the governor exclusively just moments ago about the Supreme Court's move [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=74.08s)]
*  and her efforts to protect reproductive rights in her state. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  Oregon Governor Tina Kotec, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=82.22s)]
*  First off, let me get your reaction to the Supreme Court's decision to maintain access [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  to McPeper Stone while this challenge continues to play out. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=90.82s)]
*  Well, I'm glad we have a stay from the Supreme Court. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=94.86s)]
*  But this isn't over, and states have to be prepared. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=99.86s)]
*  Access to McPeper Stone is still in jeopardy, but we're glad that this stay has happened. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=105.66s)]
*  But that doesn't mean we can step back and not be prepared, because this could change. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=110.58s)]
*  It could go quickly back through the courts, and we could be looking at denying Americans [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=115.5s)]
*  across our country access to very basic medications. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=121.74s)]
*  Interestingly enough, just before this court's ruling, you announced that your state partnered [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=125.94s)]
*  with Oregon Health and Science University to secure a three-year supply, which is about [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=131.46s)]
*  22,500 doses of McPeper Stone. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=137.94s)]
*  Talk to us about that move. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=142.66s)]
*  What led you to do that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, politics should never get in the way of having access to health care. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=146.5s)]
*  And when we knew the Texas ruling, a rogue judge in Texas saying we shouldn't have access [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=151.38s)]
*  to this basic medication that has been proven to be effective and safe, I started to consult [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  with the providers on the ground and talk to them across the state about what they're [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=164.02s)]
*  seeing, what they need. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=168.26000000000002s)]
*  And they said, we need to have a supply in Oregon of McPeper Stone, not only for abortion, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=169.62s)]
*  but for miscarriage management. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=174.66000000000003s)]
*  And so we went forward and have purchased those doses, and they are now in state, and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=176.82000000000002s)]
*  we have them, and that guarantees access to those very basic, proven medications. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=181.3s)]
*  And that was just, you know, that move on McPeper Stone is just one part of a larger effort. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=187.3s)]
*  I understand that you are undertaking on the broader conversation on reproductive [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=192.5s)]
*  rights in your state. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=196.74s)]
*  You're also instructing state boards that license medical providers to clarify that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=198.1s)]
*  Oregon, quote, supports providers in continuing to provide reproductive health care, including [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=202.58s)]
*  prescribing, dispensing, and using McPeper Stone, regardless of the decision in the Texas [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=208.42s)]
*  law suit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=214.02s)]
*  What are you hoping that that will accomplish? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=214.82s)]
*  Well, I think we have to be clear. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=220.1s)]
*  We are fighting a national agenda to restrict access to abortion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=221.86s)]
*  Ever since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, everything is up in the air now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  So we as state leaders and as a governor who has been active on guaranteeing access to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=230.74s)]
*  reproductive health care, even before it became governor, we have to keep pushing hard here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=236.5s)]
*  So that's access to the medication, protecting the providers who I will not support nonfugitive [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=241.86s)]
*  extraditions to other states for providers who are doing their job here in our state, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=250.18s)]
*  making sure people have access to health care. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=254.58s)]
*  Our licensing boards need to give those directions. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=256.66s)]
*  And one of the things that we're looking at here, we have another bill in front of the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=259.38s)]
*  legislature here in Oregon to clarify the protections for our providers as it relates [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  to reproductive health care. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=269.7s)]
*  And the legislature is also considering sending to the voters here a constitutional amendment [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=271.3s)]
*  to the Oregon Constitution protecting the right to abortion, gender affirming care, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=276.98s)]
*  marriage equality on the basis of protecting people from discrimination. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=283.62s)]
*  All of these things are essential because as a state, as these decisions have come back to the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  state, we have to protect individuals' freedom and their access to health care. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=293.86s)]
*  What is your understanding, perhaps more broadly speaking, as a politician, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=298.74s)]
*  what is your understanding of why Republicans are targeting and going after reproductive rights, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=303.86s)]
*  an issue that the overwhelming majority of Americans support and access for women in this country? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=309.7s)]
*  Yeah, I want to reaffirm that Americans widely support access to reproductive health care, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=318.58s)]
*  including abortion. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=324.42s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court is out of step with Americans. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=325.54s)]
*  And honestly, from a political standpoint, I don't understand other than to rev up your [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=328.26s)]
*  base why you think this is something that the vast majority of Americans would be okay with. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=333.14s)]
*  But I'm not thinking about the politics. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=338.58s)]
*  I'm thinking about the basics of health care and the freedom to choose what happens to your body, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=340.26s)]
*  what happens to your life. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=347.14s)]
*  When individuals don't have access to basic health care, like the ability to seek out an abortion, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  it affects their entire lives, their economic security, their future. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=356.34s)]
*  For me, it's never about the politics, whether what side of the aisle you're on. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  It is about making sure that people have access to basic freedoms and health care. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=364.98s)]
*  And I am never going to step back from that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=368.66s)]
*  That is something I believe in. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=370.74s)]
*  That is something Oregonians believe in, and frankly, the vast majority of Americans. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=372.18s)]
*  There is a push in the Oregon Legislator by the Democrats who want to ask voters to write [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=375.94s)]
*  the right to an abortion, same-sex marriage, gender-affirming care into the state's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=382.34000000000003s)]
*  constitution. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=387.22s)]
*  In fact, the state Senate majority leader just introduced a joint resolution this week to refer [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=387.94000000000005s)]
*  to voters a proposed constitutional amendment, which would appear on ballots in November 2024. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=393.3s)]
*  Do you support that effort? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=399.3s)]
*  Do you think that effort will actually make its way to your desk or to the constitution of the state? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=400.66s)]
*  I do support sending that constitutional amendment to voters. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=407.94000000000005s)]
*  It is our way of saying, let's guarantee the future of our state and the basic freedoms that we all [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=411.78s)]
*  believe in. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=418.5s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court, particularly with the DAP's decision, the world has changed. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  And so it's not enough to have protections and statute. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=424.58s)]
*  And some of the things that we have taken for granted in Oregon were based on decisions by [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=428.09999999999997s)]
*  the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=432.74s)]
*  That is all in jeopardy and up in the air. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=434.26s)]
*  So by putting a constitutional amendment in front of voters, we're saying, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=436.5s)]
*  who are we as Oregonians? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=440.5s)]
*  What do we believe in? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=442.18s)]
*  And do we believe in a state where people have the freedom to choose their future, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=443.14s)]
*  whatever that looks like? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=449.14s)]
*  And that is what that constitutional amendment is about. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=450.18s)]
*  This week marked 100 days in office for you as governor of Oregon. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=452.66s)]
*  Can you broadly tell us about your time in office? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=456.74s)]
*  What have you already accomplished? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=460.26s)]
*  What are you turning your efforts to next as you look forward to the future in your state? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=461.7s)]
*  Well, yeah, we just hit 100 days. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=467.78s)]
*  It's been a sprint. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=469.3s)]
*  We've been setting up the foundation on the key issues facing Oregonians. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=470.58s)]
*  Housing and homelessness crisis in our state is a substantial problem. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=474.66s)]
*  We want to make sure people have access to mental health and addiction treatment that they need. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=478.5s)]
*  And very concerned about our youngest Oregonians not being able to read. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=484.18s)]
*  Our kids are behind because of the pandemic. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=489.46000000000004s)]
*  We need to focus on the science of reading to help them get back on track. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=491.94s)]
*  But broadly speaking, my main issues are about economic security and people being able to have [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=496.02s)]
*  access to opportunity and prosperity. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=503.14s)]
*  That is why I care about the issue of reproductive health care and access to Mifor-Cristo. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  These things are all related. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=510.65999999999997s)]
*  People don't live in one item or one issue. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=512.18s)]
*  All these things affect people's lives. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=515.86s)]
*  And so while I'm focused on housing and mental health and our schools, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSggwBuwSzE&t=517.54s)]
