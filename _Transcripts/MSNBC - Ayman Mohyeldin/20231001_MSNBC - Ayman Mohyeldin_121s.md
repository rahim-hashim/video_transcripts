**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0)
*  We also understand that the White House has released a statement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll get that statement to you shortly in just a moment. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=5.0s)]
*  Actually, I have the statement. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Let me read it for you right here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  I just got it in our inbox. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=10.68s)]
*  This is a statement from President Joe Biden on the passage of the bipartisan bill. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=11.68s)]
*  Tonight, bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate voted to keep the government open, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=15.56s)]
*  preventing an unnecessary crisis that would have inflicted needless pain on millions of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=19.88s)]
*  hardworking Americans. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=25.16s)]
*  This bill ensures the active duty troops will continue to get paid, travelers will be spared, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=26.38s)]
*  airport delays, millions of women and children will continue to have access to vital nutrition [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=31.46s)]
*  assistance and so much more. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=36.34s)]
*  This is good news for the American people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=38.58s)]
*  But I want to be clear. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=40.82s)]
*  We should never have been in this position in the first place. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  Just a few months ago, Speaker McCarthy and I reached a budget agreement to avoid precisely [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=45.8s)]
*  this type of manufactured crisis. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=51.34s)]
*  For weeks, extreme House Republicans tried to walk away from that deal by demanding [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=55.38s)]
*  drastic cuts that would have been devastating for millions of Americans. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=60.06s)]
*  They failed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=64.94s)]
*  While the Speaker and the overwhelming majority of Congress have been steadfast in their support [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=66.42s)]
*  for Ukraine, there is no new funding in this agreement to continue that support. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=70.34s)]
*  We cannot, under any circumstances, allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=75.4s)]
*  I fully expect the Speaker will keep his commitment to the people of Ukraine and secure passage [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=82.42s)]
*  of the support needed to help Ukraine at this critical moment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=87.78s)]
*  That was a statement just into our newsroom here from the White House. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo79_xeLvp0&t=91.69999999999999s)]
