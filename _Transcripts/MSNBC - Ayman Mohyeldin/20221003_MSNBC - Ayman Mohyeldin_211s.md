# GOP May Have Infrastructure To Challenge Votes In The Midterms
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI)
*  Turning now to tonight's other top story, Republicans have learned their lesson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=0.0s)]
*  No, not the good kind of lesson learning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=8.64s)]
*  And let me explain this for you here in just a second. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=11.36s)]
*  In 2020, we all saw it, Republicans failed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=14.64s)]
*  And after losing the popular vote and the Electoral College, the GOP tried to overturn [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=17.92s)]
*  the election results through illegal and fraudulent means. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=23.3s)]
*  That failed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=27.12s)]
*  Two years later, they've learned from those mistakes, and they are coming back with a [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=28.46s)]
*  vengeance. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=33.42s)]
*  Since those failed efforts to overturn the elections, the Republican Party, both at the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=34.42s)]
*  legislative level and the activist level, have regrouped and built this anti-democratic [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=38.58s)]
*  infrastructure and coalition that they lacked the last time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=44.92s)]
*  Now, we're not talking about Rudy Giuliani ranting outside a landscaping company anymore. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=49.06s)]
*  No, that's not what we're talking about here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=54.38s)]
*  Conservative legal scholars and right-wing nuts, they are coming together and counting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=56.5s)]
*  on the new conservative supermajority in the Supreme Court to do the heavy lifting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=61.78s)]
*  for them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=66.18s)]
*  As we discussed last night on this show, the Court's about to hear a consequential case, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=67.18s)]
*  Moore v. Harper, which, if endorsed by the justices, would allow Republican-led state [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=72.38s)]
*  legislators unfettered abilities to gerrymander, cut back early voting hours, make other changes [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=77.58s)]
*  to election processes in their states, all of that without any kind of judicial oversight. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=84.0s)]
*  Another case on the docket, Merrill v. Milligan, that could eliminate one of the few remaining [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=90.64s)]
*  nationwide safeguards against rigged legislative maps. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=96.04s)]
*  If the conservative Supreme Court doesn't go along with these psychotic legal fantasies, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=99.44s)]
*  right-wing activist groups have laid down other infrastructure to ensure that Americans [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=105.44s)]
*  won't have their voices heard. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=110.32s)]
*  In at least 11 states, complaints are emerging about conservative canvassing groups going [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=112.56s)]
*  door to door, searching for proof of voter fraud, raising concerns among civil rights [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=117.68s)]
*  watchdogs and some election officials and even the Justice Department. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  In Washington state, for example, those complaints include canvassers becoming hostile, telling [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=128.04s)]
*  voters they work for elections offices and even displaying fake badges. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=132.96s)]
*  The Washington secretary of state has called it what it is, voter intimidation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=138.24s)]
*  Other activist groups are working to toss out tens of thousands of voter registrations [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=143.16s)]
*  and ballots in battleground states, increasing the chances that overburdened election officials [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=147.12s)]
*  could actually make mistakes that disenfranchise voters. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  According to the Associated Press, some of these conservative activists are now signing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=156.32s)]
*  up to help administer elections for the first time, further endangering the very democratic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=160.92s)]
*  process. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  But I've got to be clear about this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=169.0s)]
*  Danger in this process is real. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=170.72s)]
*  Republicans almost got what they wanted back in 2020. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  They might be sore losers, but they are not dumb losers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=176.28s)]
*  Given another chance to destroy our democracy, they won't make the same mistake again. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=180.68s)]
*  . [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ust4k04WxcI&t=198.08s)]
