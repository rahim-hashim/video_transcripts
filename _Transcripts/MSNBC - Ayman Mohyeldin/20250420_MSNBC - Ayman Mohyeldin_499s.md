# Actress Holly Robinson Peete denounces RFK Jr.'s harmful claims about autism
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE)
*  Autism destroys families. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=0.0s)]
*  More importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which are our children. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=4.04s)]
*  These are kids who will never pay taxes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=7.76s)]
*  They'll never hold a job. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=11.8s)]
*  They'll never play baseball. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=14.0s)]
*  They'll never write a poem. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=16.6s)]
*  They'll never go out on a date. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=18.32s)]
*  Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=20.6s)]
*  That was our Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., projecting a small [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=26.2s)]
*  and limited life for children diagnosed with autism. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=31.84s)]
*  In the same breath, he also baselessly claimed that autism is preventable and due to environmental [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=35.96s)]
*  causes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=41.6s)]
*  Researchers who spent decades studying autism have never narrowed it down to just a single [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=43.2s)]
*  cause. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=47.64s)]
*  R.F.K. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=48.64s)]
*  Jr. didn't just face backlash from experts. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=49.64s)]
*  He also received widespread criticism and condemnation from autistic people and those [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=51.5s)]
*  who know and love them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=56.78s)]
*  That includes actress Holly Robinson Peat, the mother to a 27-year-old son with autism. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=58.96s)]
*  Holly Robinson Peat joins me now to discuss this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=65.1s)]
*  She's an actress, author, co-founder of the Holly Rod Foundation with her husband, and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=68.06s)]
*  she has used her voice in a very powerful way to discuss this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  Holly, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=76.78s)]
*  I saw something that you posted. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=78.38s)]
*  I was deeply moved by it and I wanted a chance to talk to you about this, so thanks for being [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=80.30000000000001s)]
*  with us today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=84.26s)]
*  So happy to be here and speak with you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=85.26s)]
*  Even hearing it again, I can't tell you how viscerally I react. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  I cannot believe that he said the things that he said. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=93.34s)]
*  I cannot believe that in 2025 we're still re-litigating the possibilities for people [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=96.26s)]
*  who are on the spectrum. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  It's amazing the language that he uses. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=107.06s)]
*  It sounds to me, Michelle, like he's never sat down with a family and never even had [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=111.46s)]
*  a conversation with anybody who has autism or who loves someone with autism. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=116.46s)]
*  It just is mind-blowing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=121.74s)]
*  The dangerous negative rhetoric that he put forward. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  I had a never day in 2000 when I sat next to my husband and a pediatrician who told [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=128.8s)]
*  us all these things our son would never do. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=135.46s)]
*  He was only three years old and it was devastating. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=138.5s)]
*  He would never speak, say I love you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=142.26000000000002s)]
*  He would never play team sports. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=144.46s)]
*  He would never have meaningful employment, friends, all the things. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=146.5s)]
*  If I had just curled up in a ball and just given into those nevers, I don't know who [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  RJ would be today. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  This is dangerous language and we cannot have it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=160.66s)]
*  I want you to tell us a little bit about RJ. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=164.78s)]
*  You have been a tremendous advocate for your son. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=167.74s)]
*  He was diagnosed with autism when he was three years old. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=171.98s)]
*  Did I get that right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=174.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=176.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=177.18s)]
*  I want to learn a little bit more about what it's like being his mother. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=178.18s)]
*  I love something that you said that this doesn't destroy families. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=182.38s)]
*  It actually teaches you something about what unconditional love really means. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=186.26s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=190.18s)]
*  Just off the top, autism is a spectrum disorder so everybody's going to have a different [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=192.02s)]
*  journey. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=196.26s)]
*  Not everyone's going to have the type of outcome that RJ had, but he's such a special, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=197.26s)]
*  I almost said kid, but he's 27. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  He's so amazing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=204.66s)]
*  He's so pure. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=205.66s)]
*  He's so lovely. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=206.66s)]
*  When he got this job working for the Los Angeles Dodgers nine years ago, it changed his life. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=208.22s)]
*  It gave him purpose and dignity and a paycheck and it helped him self-advocate. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=214.18s)]
*  These are the things that we would hope for our people with autism, that they will be [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=220.7s)]
*  valuable people in society. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=224.82s)]
*  He never had any friends growing up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=226.7s)]
*  Now he's got a whole clubhouse full of friends. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  These Dodgers have embraced him and they love him and they gave him support to get through [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=230.1s)]
*  this job. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  This is a kid that was told all these things he would never do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=235.54s)]
*  One of the things that the secretary said is that he would never pay taxes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=238.33999999999997s)]
*  That just threw me off because he actually asked me who Fika was because that's actually [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=243.78s)]
*  Fika. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  On his paycheck. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=249.86s)]
*  You're a taxpayer now, so you got to know who that is. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=250.86s)]
*  These are the things. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  One of the things he said was he would never write a poem. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  I hadn't even realized until I went down rabbit holes of looking at videos of RJ in the last [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=259.58s)]
*  couple of days. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=265.22s)]
*  There he is talking about this poem that he wrote where he talked about what it was like [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=266.22s)]
*  to be nonverbal. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=270.06s)]
*  I posted that as well. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=271.3s)]
*  He's a great kid. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=274.48s)]
*  I have met through our Hollyrod Foundation so many amazing kids and so many families [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=275.58s)]
*  who have higher support needs than RJ, but yet are beautiful, valuable, and they need [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=280.68s)]
*  services and programs, Michelle. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=288.3s)]
*  We're not even having that conversation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=291.02s)]
*  What did R.F. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=294.14s)]
*  Cake get wrong when he says that this destroys life, when he says that this is preventable, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=295.14s)]
*  when he says that there are potentially environmental causes? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=299.94s)]
*  He got everything wrong when he said that autism destroys families. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=304.98s)]
*  He got everything that he said was wrong. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=309.38s)]
*  Are there young people who struggle with some of the things that autism presents, how it [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=312.5s)]
*  presents? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=318.74s)]
*  Yes, struggle more than others. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=319.74s)]
*  He got all of that wrong. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=321.26s)]
*  When it comes to causation, when RJ was diagnosed in 2000, I was a mad woman trying to figure [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=323.06s)]
*  out what causes this, what is this? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=327.38s)]
*  I think parents want to know, but at some point I just focused and shifted all my energy [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=329.58000000000004s)]
*  on giving RJ the best chance at life, on getting surrounding him with a team of people who [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=334.38s)]
*  love him. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=338.82s)]
*  As a mom of a kid with autism, the scariest thing in the world is what happens when I [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  die? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  Where am I going to go? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  Who's going to understand him? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  Who's going to love him properly? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  I wanted to set him up for success as much as I could. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=348.85999999999996s)]
*  With our foundation, a lot of the things that we do helps to support these families that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=352.26s)]
*  are impacted by autism. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=357.41999999999996s)]
*  I simply can't imagine being a secretary of Health and Human Services and speaking on [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  autism so negatively like this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=366.06s)]
*  One of the things that he said even after that, Michelle, I don't know if you heard, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=370.1s)]
*  but he also even talked about an adult with autism. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  He's never seen a 70-year-old man with autism walking around a mall. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=375.86s)]
*  In other words, autism doesn't impact people as they get older, but my son is 27 and he's [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=381.7s)]
*  still on the spectrum. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=386.78000000000003s)]
*  I can direct him to many people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=388.26s)]
*  If you're going to talk about us, you need to learn from us. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=390.9s)]
*  Is part of the issue here the tone that he took in talking about autism? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=394.74s)]
*  This is a chance for actually, autism is in the spotlight, but the tone he used was dismissive [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=398.78s)]
*  and apparently quite hurtful to a lot of people, including you. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=404.62s)]
*  I called it institutionalized hopelessness. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=408.26s)]
*  I called it such a down, negative way and it creates a boogeyman out of autism. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=412.98s)]
*  Also, the biggest thing, the first thing that jumped off to me was autism is a disease. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=420.82s)]
*  It's what he said and it is not. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=425.66s)]
*  It is a disorder. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=427.66s)]
*  It's a difference. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=428.66s)]
*  It's a neurodevelopmental issue. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=429.66s)]
*  I just think he got it all wrong. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=433.02s)]
*  I hope that he talks to a family or someone to sort of school him. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=435.1s)]
*  He needs an autism 101 so bad. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=439.7s)]
*  It's not even funny. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=442.34s)]
*  So I'm praying that he will see the light and talk to some families because right now [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=443.34s)]
*  he is misrepresenting the journeys of what so many families are going through and how [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=448.29999999999995s)]
*  hard our kids have fought. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=453.97999999999996s)]
*  RJ said to me, mom, I've come so far and I'm really insulted by what he said. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=455.97999999999996s)]
*  And I said, yes, son, because he's wrong and he needs to figure out what autism is. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=461.58s)]
*  All these families need support and compassion and jobs and all the things that you do and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=470.02s)]
*  value in life. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20krBWZIVyE&t=477.21999999999997s)]
