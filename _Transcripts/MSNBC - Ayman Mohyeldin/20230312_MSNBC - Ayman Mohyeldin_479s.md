Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have proposed similar measures restricting drag performance. Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro spoke with drag performer, trans activist and Tennessee native Eureka O’Hara about just how dangerous this new law is for drag performers and the LGBTQ community as a whole.

# 'Drag Race' star Eureka O'Hara on Tennessee's drag show ban
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0)
*  Public drag performances are now against the law in Tennessee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=0.0s)]
*  The state's Republican governor, Bill Lee, signed a first of its kind bill prohibiting [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=7.68s)]
*  drag shows on public property or any location where they can be viewed by minors. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=11.6s)]
*  The bill specifically bans, quote, adult cabaret entertainment such as topless dancers, go-go [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=17.1s)]
*  dancers, exotic dancers, strippers, male or female impersonators, or similar entertainers. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=22.76s)]
*  Not only does this language paint drag as overtly sexual, which it's not, activists [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=29.68s)]
*  warn the vague wording outlawing male or female impersonators also puts trans people at risk [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=35.44s)]
*  of being punished for merely existing in public. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=42.16s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=46.2s)]
*  This isn't just a Tennessee problem. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=47.36s)]
*  Lawmakers in more than a dozen other states, including my home state of Texas, West Virginia, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=50.44s)]
*  and Nebraska have proposed measures that would similarly restrict drag. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=56.16s)]
*  Joining me now is Eureka O'Hara. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=60.8s)]
*  She's a Tennessee native, a drag performer, and former contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  She's also a trans activist and the producer and star of HBO's We're Here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=69.2s)]
*  Eureka, thank you for joining me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=74.96s)]
*  What does this new Tennessee law do to the drag and LGBTQ community there? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=78.4s)]
*  Honestly, what it does is it just instills fear in us, which society has continued to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=87.0s)]
*  do to the LGBTQ community, but it's also hindering us from being successful in allowing people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=91.48s)]
*  to experience our art, which pushes equality, it pushes representation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=98.56s)]
*  Drag queens have always been at the front and the forefront of queer activism. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=103.6s)]
*  Even at the Stonewall riots, it's known that a drag queen threw the first stone. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=108.32s)]
*  How dangerous does this law make it for drag performers and trans people to just exist [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  there in Tennessee? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=122.52s)]
*  I really appreciate that question because what it does is it actually supports people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=125.44s)]
*  that are discriminatory and have a bigot mindset in a way that they feel validated because [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=131.32s)]
*  someone with a position of power such as someone we voted into office is basically sexually [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=137.88s)]
*  utilizing our existence and also tearing it down to stripper notoriety, which actually [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=146.16s)]
*  takes away a lot of the hard work that a lot of us put in to create equality and love and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  to create families for ourselves. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=158.64s)]
*  And a lot of times queer people don't have that to exist or coexist or even learn how [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=160.28s)]
*  to become the adults they should be. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=165.56s)]
*  Based on your life experience and your activism, that you have a unique perspective on this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=168.8s)]
*  You're originally from eastern Tennessee. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=177.44s)]
*  Do you feel safe in your home state these days? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=179.52s)]
*  No, I never felt truly safe. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=183.08s)]
*  As soon as I was able to run to California, I did because I actually de-transitioned early [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=186.8s)]
*  in my 20s out of fear, out of trauma, out of abuse that I received from that social [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  moral coded society. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  And until recently, I actually didn't come out fully as trans because I didn't believe [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=201.28s)]
*  that I would be safe or be able to have success in my life. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=206.84s)]
*  And luckily, drag is what gave me the confidence to be able to do that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's why I sat here and I speak for all of my community when I say that our intention [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  is never to harm children. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=221.56s)]
*  Our intention is to speak to those little queer children that are like we were when [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=222.56s)]
*  we were at that age that need representation and visibility. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=227.92s)]
*  And they need to see people like them or else they're going to be lost and it's going to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  push them down a really dark path. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=237.56s)]
*  And that is what we should be afraid of more than drag queens appearing in public. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=239.76s)]
*  We know that Tennessee is just one of many states right now trying to ban drag performance [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=246.64s)]
*  and trans health care as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=251.72s)]
*  In fact, according to Trevor Projects National Survey, 93 percent of trans and non-binary [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=253.6s)]
*  youth say they're worried about being denied access to gender affirming medical care due [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=260.28s)]
*  to state or local laws. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=265.2s)]
*  How concerned should we all be about this? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=267.48s)]
*  I mean, honestly, it not only is taking away parental rights to raise their children and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  to bring diversity into their homes and their existence, but also it's taking away the opportunity [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=276.2s)]
*  for someone at a young age to truly discover who they are. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  I can tell you all that from a very, very honestly, the first thoughts of who I was [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=285.84s)]
*  as a person, I always felt indifferent from the people around me. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=291.24s)]
*  I never felt like I belonged. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=295.28s)]
*  And it was never because I was queer or gay or quote unquote F.A.G. like that was called. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=297.4s)]
*  It's because of my gender. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=304.12s)]
*  I didn't feel like the boy that they were calling me as. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=305.24s)]
*  So I know from personal experience that it can be very traumatizing to that existence. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=307.76s)]
*  It can be harmful to the health of these children. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=312.64s)]
*  You know, they're also demanding for people that have already been on and these children [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=315.72s)]
*  to be off of that HRT therapy they've been on in a very aggressive pattern, which isn't [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=319.52s)]
*  healthy either. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=325.48s)]
*  I mean, this is also a medical issue. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=326.48s)]
*  I mean, it's I just don't understand how we can take away the rights of people being able [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=329.56s)]
*  to provide medically and making parental decisions for their own children as well as outlawing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  those parental decisions as well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  It's really scary and harmful to those children and other queer kids like that for anyone [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=341.36s)]
*  that wants to be indifferent from moral code in society. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=345.8s)]
*  On Thursday, you announced that you've officially been able to legally change your name and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  gender marker. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=354.56s)]
*  First of all, congratulations. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=355.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=358.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=360.0s)]
*  And talk to me, Eureka, about that moment and what it means for you, especially as the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=361.0s)]
*  LGBTQ community faces attacks from all sides. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=365.88s)]
*  It was extremely exciting. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=372.55999999999995s)]
*  I, you know, I was overwhelmed with happy tears because I never thought a million years [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=374.4s)]
*  I would ever see my living society acknowledge me for who I really am. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=380.28s)]
*  It was just powerful. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  And it just really gave me the fire I needed. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=389.8s)]
*  And I still fear because in Tennessee, there are marker changes on documents that I need [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=391.76s)]
*  to be able to thrive, even though I was accepted that change, where there are laws still in [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=397.8s)]
*  place that that are going to restrict me from being able to have those documents to continue [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  living successfully. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=407.44s)]
*  And I'm hoping that I can fight that being Tennessee, one of many states to still have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=408.44s)]
*  those restrictions on birth certificates, social security alterations, things like that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=413.28s)]
*  But someone who gets married and so on and so forth, there's no issues. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=418.56s)]
*  I think that there is a there's just a underlying negativity around being trans or gender non [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=422.0s)]
*  conforming any type of gender expression that's not to a social norm of the binary. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=431.52s)]
*  And it's just harmful to the progression of our society and our youth, especially at the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=437.4s)]
*  diversity level that our youth is at today because they are discovering who they are [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=442.64s)]
*  so early in life. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=447.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=449.28s)]
*  Eureka O'Hara. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=450.28s)]
*  Thank you for joining me. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKYhxrNJe0&t=452.08s)]
