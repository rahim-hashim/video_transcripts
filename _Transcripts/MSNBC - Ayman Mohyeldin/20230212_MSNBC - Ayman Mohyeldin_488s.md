# Syrians plead for help after earthquakes cause widespread devastation
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM)
*  Right now, aid and rescue workers from around the globe are flocking to help Turkey after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=0.0s)]
*  the devastating earthquake that hit almost a week ago. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=7.16s)]
*  But in war-torn Syria, which was also hit, the story is very different. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  The country has been in a brutal civil war since 2014, which has complicated rescue efforts [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=15.32s)]
*  from outside nations. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=20.28s)]
*  NPR reports today that they saw, quote, no international crews of rescuers, no trucks [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=21.72s)]
*  loaded with machinery or medical aid, no streams of ambulances to save the wounded. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=26.44s)]
*  The border crossing into Syria was empty and silent. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  So rescue and recovery efforts have been left to the Syria Civil Defense, better known as [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  the White Helmets, which is a group of volunteers trying to save their friends, their families, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=40.6s)]
*  and more. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Nation after this disaster who have been carrying out similar work since the start of the civil [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  war. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=53.6s)]
*  They've been doing it for years now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=54.6s)]
*  Last night, the White Helmets miraculously rescued two young girls from the rubble in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=55.76s)]
*  Gendir's. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=60.2s)]
*  But with little aid from the outside and hope in the region dwindling fast, that remains [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=61.44s)]
*  the challenge. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=68.04s)]
*  Earlier today, I spoke with a member of the White Helmets, Ismail Abdullah, about his [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=69.04s)]
*  work on the ground. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=73.16s)]
*  Ismail Abdullah, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=75.12s)]
*  You're there on the ground. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=80.08s)]
*  Talk to me about what it's like. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=81.84s)]
*  What is the situation right now on the ground in Syria where you are? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=83.42s)]
*  After six days of carrying out search and rescue operations, we reached a point that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=89.9s)]
*  we cannot and we there are no survivors. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=100.86s)]
*  Now we are in next stage or next phase of recovering the dead bodies. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=107.38000000000001s)]
*  This happened because we are after six days, in the first day and at the beginning, we [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  said and declared this area and this catastrophe means international effort, means other parties [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  bigger than us who had the capacity to handle this disaster. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=134.66s)]
*  But no one responded until today and we reached from yesterday maybe after 70 hours of carrying [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=140.56s)]
*  out search and rescue operations, we lost and we lost the hope of getting people alive [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=151.44s)]
*  beneath rubble. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  It has been, as you said, almost six days. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  What are your biggest concerns at this point? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=169.94s)]
*  I mean, I know you don't sound very optimistic, but do you believe there could still be survivors [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=173.28s)]
*  under the rubble as you get some international assistance? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=180.32s)]
*  After more than six days and more than 120 hours of work, we lost hope. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=189.72s)]
*  We lost hope and we had miracle before and we deep inside we feel there's something that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=200.76s)]
*  will tell us maybe that we will get people alive from beneath rubble. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=213.76s)]
*  But the reality is it has been a long time, a week, almost a week, and those stuck under [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  the rubble, it's difficult to get people alive from under the rubble after all this time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=231.88s)]
*  Even if we got the assistance today or tomorrow. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=243.64s)]
*  There may be people who are not familiar with the situation, broadly speaking about Syria. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  How has the civil war in Syria impacted and complicated your recovery efforts? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=252.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's complicated for those who don't know the context of Syria. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=260.4s)]
*  In brief, I will explain it in one line. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=266.64s)]
*  Northwest Syria, an area in the north that now hosts most of the people who were displaced [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=271.2s)]
*  from other parts of Syria since 2014 up to now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=277.64s)]
*  There were many cities in parts of Syria and all of them now living in the northwest Syria [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=282.0s)]
*  after the bombings and displacement that were exposed in their cities and villages. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=290.0s)]
*  It's very complicated because the regime bombed this area over the past years to destroy the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  infrastructure, destroy its hospitals, and made the medical points as targets for its forces. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=309.16s)]
*  Then the earthquake came and hit the region, which made this big catastrophe that, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=319.52s)]
*  as we mentioned before, as white helmets and an institution that operate in northwest Syria [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  cannot handle. We appealed for help. No one responded. And now we're losing many, many lives. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=337.84s)]
*  We lost hope and we lost many lives. We could have saved if they supported us [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  after 20, 40 hours from the earthquake. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=356.88000000000005s)]
*  Let me ask you if I can finally, as you look forward to the next phase of this operation, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  not so much a rescue, but perhaps a recovery operation, what do you need from the international [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=369.76000000000005s)]
*  community? What can other nations and people watching this do to help you and the people [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=377.68s)]
*  of Syria at this moment? This moment and as we speak and this week and the weeks after the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=382.8s)]
*  people who lost their houses need assistance, the displaced people need assistance. What we need from [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=391.68s)]
*  international community to send the convoys to help for those who were affected to send [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=399.2s)]
*  medical supplies for the injured to receive proper treatment, not to let the injured to die [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=408.0s)]
*  from their injury. What we need is equipment that helps us in removing the rubble and somehow to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=416.08s)]
*  enable us to help our community to recover from the impact of the earthquake [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=427.76s)]
*  so people can resume to their lives and can get back to normalcy of their lives. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=435.92s)]
*  Ismail, Abdullah live for us in Syria. Ismail, thank you so much. I greatly appreciate your time. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  My best to you and all of your colleagues still working to rescue and recover people in Syria. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=452.72s)]
*  Thank you for your time. Thank you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vQOjw9qpuM&t=482.72s)]
