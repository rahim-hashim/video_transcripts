# Trump’s Legal Troubles Continue To Pile Up
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE)
*  The clock is ticking for Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=0.0s)]
*  According to a new letter filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, the state [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=5.2s)]
*  plans to fast-track its civil lawsuit against Trump, the Trump Organization, and three of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=9.68s)]
*  its children. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=14.08s)]
*  James, who's accused the Trump of—the Trumps, rather, of fraud, wants a trial to start before [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=15.08s)]
*  the end of 2023, citing a, quote, ongoing scheme. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=21.04s)]
*  The expedited timeline could have massive ramifications for Trump's expected 2024 presidential [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  run, also casting a shadow over that run. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=29.92s)]
*  The Justice Department's investigation into the classified documents retrieved from Trump's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=33.28s)]
*  home. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=37.6s)]
*  Yesterday, the DOJ asked a court to speed up its appeal of the appointment of a special [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=38.6s)]
*  master claiming the process is slowing down its criminal investigation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=42.68s)]
*  And breaking just hours ago, we learned that the National Archives believes it doesn't [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=47.08s)]
*  have all the records it should have from the Trump administration. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=50.96s)]
*  In a letter that was sent to Congress, the head of the Archives wrote, we do not have [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=55.28s)]
*  custody of everything we should. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=59.08s)]
*  Now, theoretically, that means Trump's still committing a crime right now as we speak. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  And a new report from the folks at Just Security show from publicly available DOJ documents, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Trump legal briefs, social media posts, and news reports that Trump knew he was doing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=73.72s)]
*  something wrong by retaining those documents. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Their bottom line? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=81.78s)]
*  Quote, the record as a whole points to Trump's culpability. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=83.12s)]
*  And here's some broader context for you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=88.44s)]
*  Trump has now been credibly accused of committing at least 55 criminal offenses since he launched [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=90.48s)]
*  his first campaign for president back in 2015, according to a new ethics report from Crew. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=96.52s)]
*  That average, well, as you can guess, it averages to about eight crimes a year. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  Eight crimes every year. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=107.4s)]
*  And here's the point I want to hit home with these two reports. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=110.08s)]
*  They're both based on publicly available information, but it's taken months and sometimes [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=113.8s)]
*  years to paint these portraits of a man who's aware of his wrongdoing and whose pattern [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=118.96s)]
*  of wrongdoing is far and wide. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=123.96s)]
*  Now, we don't necessarily have months and years longer to find out what more Trump might [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=126.72s)]
*  be doing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=131.2s)]
*  How else he might be basically committing these crimes? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=132.56s)]
*  The clock's ticking for Trump, and we need that clock to tick faster and faster for the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=136.6s)]
*  sake of our country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=141.8s)]
*  Otherwise, we could see a future president Trump try to bury his wrongdoing just like [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=143.12s)]
*  he did the last time he was in office. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  And we all remember how that ended. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMGPU-sjXE&t=149.64000000000001s)]
