Now, with hundreds of millions of views and over a million followers, it's become a phenomenon.

# 'Subway Takes' Kareem Rahma tells MSNBC his takes for the year
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA)
*  So what's your take? At some point in the modern era, I feel like waiters started [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=0.0s)]
*  to get trained by like corporate consultants and they started to say this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=6.2s)]
*  one phrase that I find disgusting. What is it? How's everything tasting? So what's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  your take? I think couples should have separate beds. 100% agree, absolutely. In [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=15.92s)]
*  fact, I think they should have separate bedrooms. Restaurants where the vibe is [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=20.6s)]
*  better than the food need to be fined, shut down, or they at least have to post [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  a disclaimer in the window. 100% agree. I'm saying you don't go for the vibe. We [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=29.04s)]
*  don't go for the vibe. All right, so after his hit TikTok series, Keep the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=34.16s)]
*  Meter Running, Kareem Rahma kept turning awkward New York City moments into [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=38.2s)]
*  viral gold. This time he hit the subway where most people hope to avoid [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=42.24s)]
*  conversation at all costs. His idea for subway takes was simple. Skip the full [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=46.56s)]
*  podcast, just make the clip, ask one question. What's your take? The twist? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=51.8s)]
*  His guests range from pop stars like Charlie XCX to comedians like Hassan [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  Minhaj and even anthropologists like Jane Goodall. And now with hundreds of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=62.56s)]
*  millions of views and over a million followers, Subway takes has blown up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=67.42s)]
*  Rahma's company on the subway seat is so in demand he's even turning down [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=72.16s)]
*  celebrities. But thankfully he did not turn down our show because here on set [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=76.52s)]
*  in New York, Kareem Rahma. Hey buddy, good to see you. I would never turn down. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=83.24s)]
*  We feel like we were there in the beginning of your meteoric rise and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  your creative genius, so we feel like you owe us. That's why when I got the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  email I said of course. There's no way I can pass it down. We appreciate it. First of all, we're gonna flip the script on you a little bit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  So tell me a little bit about why you think, this is not a subway, but tell me [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=104.32s)]
*  why you think Subway takes has taken off. I mean I think everybody has an [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=109.6s)]
*  opinion that they want to share but they can't, especially to an audience of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=116.08s)]
*  millions of people. So people clamor at the opportunity to get in there and do [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  it. I mean I think when you're on the train there's a captive audience of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  people sitting around being like I wonder what that guy's thinking, I wonder [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=127.8s)]
*  that person's going, I wonder where that woman's, you know, on her way to. Yeah. And this is a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=131.48s)]
*  way to kind of reveal all that information. I gotta be honest, man, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=136.2s)]
*  I ride the subway a lot in New York and the subway in New York is a special kind [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=139.6s)]
*  of place, right? Like people don't have patience for something. So when you're in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  there with like a crew filming celebrities are there, do you ever get [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  anyone who's like, yo man I'm just trying to get to work, can you get out of my way? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=149.6s)]
*  Or like, no? Honestly, I mean it's like a free talk show. It's a live show and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  yeah it's people like Hasan Minhaj and Jane Goodall and ASAP Ferg. So of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=157.88s)]
*  course like everyone's like this is amazing. Do you rock up with security now [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=162.48s)]
*  whenever you're on the subway there? No, no. I'm a man of the people. I don't need [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=165.72s)]
*  security. Well what about the celebrities that show up with you? You know, the only [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=168.96s)]
*  person that had a lot of people with her was Gwen Stefani. Oh yeah? She had a lot [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  of handlers and such. Why do you think celebrities want to come on the show? I [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=177.72s)]
*  mean I know like what is it about the format, the conversation that is such an [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=182.16s)]
*  appeal to, I mean we're saying that you're turning down celebrities now. Yeah, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=186.0s)]
*  I think it's- Can you also tell us who you turned down? I can't tell you what I turned down. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=189.24s)]
*  There's a lot though. Oh yeah? Yeah, because we get like 50 emails a day. No way. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=193.32s)]
*  So it's more of a vibe based approach, right? Like people can have a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  hundred million Instagram followers and I'm just like the takes not there man. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=203.4s)]
*  The take is not good enough. But I mean it's like a hot seat. It has become this [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  kind of like you know especially comedians are at the core of the show. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Right. Like out of every ten episodes five of them are local kind of comedians, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  up-and-comers, but also successful ones and I think that's what makes the show [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=221.4s)]
*  truly incredible. They're the ones that make it happen. But I think people [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=225.4s)]
*  clamor at the opportunity to get on there because it's become a pit stop on [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=230.96s)]
*  the press tour. It's honestly like going on Fallon or whatever. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  Really quick sidebar, how do you decide what trains to take? Where do you get on? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  Where do you get off? It's a science. It's a science. It's a science and an art. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=243.44s)]
*  Sometimes we you know it just depends on the day. Like I usually I'll say I [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=247.12s)]
*  usually shoot between 11 and 2. Don't look for me people. Usually I shoot [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  between 11 and 2 and then the train it just depends on the feeling. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=258.56s)]
*  Okay. It really depends on the feeling. All right so tell me is comedy getting [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=261.96s)]
*  better or worse? I think comedy has never been better. Really? Yeah. I hundred [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=265.16s)]
*  percent agree. Let's go. Why do you think it's getting better? What's so good about it? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=270.12s)]
*  I think it's more accessible. There's a lot of new voices and it's just [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=274.52s)]
*  it's more widely distributed. I think comedians there was an era where they [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  were kind of like rock stars and that went away for a while and now [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=284.2s)]
*  comedians are back to being rock stars which is really great. I like that. I like [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=287.08s)]
*  the accessibility. I like that like when you're accessible with the people you [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=291.12s)]
*  watch on TV certainly the comedians it feels like more authentic and more real. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=293.84s)]
*  Who is the best guest since you started the series? Oh this is a crazy one but [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=297.4s)]
*  I'm gonna have to shout out this young lad, Asad Benbow. Okay. Who's a comedian. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=301.32s)]
*  He was recently on Wild and Out. I think he's like 20 years old but he's so [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=306.52s)]
*  funny and his take was it's a meta absurdity ridden. He's kind of like an [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=311.56s)]
*  Andy Kaufman character. Oh wow. And it's too crazy to say on air. Okay. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  But it is very funny. We'll tell our viewers to make sure to catch that one. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=324.84s)]
*  Which politician embarrassed themselves the most in 2024 this past year? Kamala [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=328.32s)]
*  Harris. Easy. Oh yeah. Why so? Well we did a subway take and let's just say that we had [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=334.04s)]
*  discussed doing a subway take that I thought was really good, funny and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=340.44s)]
*  strong and would connect with people and then when I got there the subway take [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=344.8s)]
*  was about bacon and I was like this is not a good idea. What's wrong with bacon? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. A lot of people don't eat it. Was it turkey bacon? No. It was real bacon. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=354.68s)]
*  It was real bacon. A lot of people don't eat bacon. A lot of people that I know [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=358.48s)]
*  don't eat bacon and it just didn't seem like a good way to to help promote [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=361.56s)]
*  anything and I don't eat bacon. Right. So there wasn't much I was like I don't [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=367.8s)]
*  know anything about this subject. I've had it once. I had to test it. I had to play a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=374.0s)]
*  little bit with the devil and try it out but I don't eat bacon so I [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=378.24s)]
*  really don't know how to connect with it. Yeah. Okay. So it was an [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=383.04s)]
*  awkward interview. All right. And it was mutually agreed upon that it's probably [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=386.84s)]
*  not to release it. Maybe that's why she lost the election. If you were to run [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=393.11999999999995s)]
*  it all came down to subway takes man. If you would have ran. That's why I [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=397.64s)]
*  didn't want to participate but now that it's over maybe I'll release it. Oh [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  interesting. Didn't want to sway the election. Finally what's your take on [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  what needs to stay in 2024 and what should we bring into 2025? What needs to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=411.64s)]
*  stay? Yeah. What do we want to leave behind? Oh what needs to what do we need [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=416.12s)]
*  to leave behind? Yeah what do we need to leave behind in 2024 in the dust in the history? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  Goodness. Probably genocide. That's a good one. An important one. And then [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=423.08s)]
*  bring peace into into 2025. A hundred percent agree as you say on subway takes [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=430.76s)]
*  all right. Let's go. That's exactly what I said. We're gonna do this same time [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=436.4s)]
*  next year. I'll be there. All right buddy. Good to see you. Thank you so much. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=440.22s)]
*  you [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxMazOytrhA&t=446.12s)]
