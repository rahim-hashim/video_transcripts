Video Description: Michael Tyler, Communications Director for the Biden-Harris 2024 re-election campaign, joins Ayman Mohyeldin to discuss his takeaways from Biden’s turnout in the South Carolina Democratic primary, and explains how their team plans to ‘scale up' operations to take on Trump in the general elections. “Trump is a fundamental threat to American freedom and democracy,” Tyler says. “We’re going to communicate what our vision is, what our accomplishments are, and we’re going to contrast that against the damage that Donald has caused when he did have power and the damage that he will cause if he’s able to regain power.”

# ‘We saw the damage he caused’: Biden Comms Director on plans to draw ‘contrast’ with Trump
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q)
*  I want to bring in now to the conversation Michael Tyler, the communications director [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  for the Biden-Harris 2024 campaign. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=3.88s)]
*  Michael, it's great to have you with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=6.04s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=8.14s)]
*  I guess congratulations are first in order for this first victory. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=9.14s)]
*  And I want to start with the mood within the campaign tonight, how you are interpreting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=12.88s)]
*  tonight's victory in South Carolina. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=17.56s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=19.92s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=22.52s)]
*  Certainly a good night for Joe Biden and for Democrats across the country, because Joe [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=23.52s)]
*  Biden is once again a winner because he has kept his promises to the backbone of the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  Democratic Party. That's black voters. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=32.82s)]
*  You're looking you're talking about the data tonight. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  We were looking at the early vote data earlier today and about 76 percent of voters were [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=36.72s)]
*  black. That's compared to 56 percent in 2020. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=43.0s)]
*  And so folks are turning out because they understand that they have a president and Joe [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Biden who's kept his promises. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=50.04s)]
*  And they understand increasingly, to your point earlier, that we have cemented the choice [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=51.76s)]
*  in this election between Joe Biden, who's been delivering, and between Donald Trump, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=57.24s)]
*  who presents a fundamental threat to American freedom and American democracy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=61.28s)]
*  So we're excited about the road ahead. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=65.72s)]
*  And we're sort of all we're full steam ahead for the general election right now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=67.6s)]
*  Let me, if I can drill down on the issue of turnout for a moment, just get a sense of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=73.12s)]
*  how you read turnout or how you want your campaign and the general the general Democratic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  Party to read the turnout, because as my colleague Steve Karnacki was pointing out, it's hard [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=82.0s)]
*  to gauge. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=85.72s)]
*  We've been in a situation like this before. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=86.76s)]
*  Previous ones, there were no primaries when an incumbent was running. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=88.76s)]
*  He's expecting the turnout to be anywhere around 37 percent, which would be slightly [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=91.92s)]
*  less than it was in a competitive, a very competitive primary back in 2020. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=96.52s)]
*  How do you read the vote turnout tonight between enthusiasm for the Biden campaign and his [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=101.2s)]
*  reelection versus not? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=107.52s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'd start by comparing this to the first Republican contest in Iowa. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=109.2s)]
*  110,000 folks turn out for the Iowa caucus is an incredibly competitive election with [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=114.24s)]
*  multiple candidates here in South Carolina tonight. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=119.52s)]
*  You'll have around 100,000 people turn out for the president because they appreciate [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=122.32s)]
*  everything that he has done over the course of his first term. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=126.88s)]
*  And they're excited about the future and they're geared up and understand the sense of urgency [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=129.76s)]
*  for the general election ahead. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=133.6s)]
*  I think if you want to look at other metrics for enthusiasm, you can look at our grassroots [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=134.88s)]
*  fundraising. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  We had our best grassroots fundraising month in January. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  Our Q4 numbers are fantastic. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  We had 97 million dollars. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=143.72s)]
*  That's largely through grassroots donations. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=145.68s)]
*  It's not 97 percent where people who are giving two hundred dollars or less, people like teachers [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=147.52s)]
*  and nurses who are chipping in five and ten bucks at a time at JoeBiden.com because they [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=152.88s)]
*  understand a what this president has done. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=157.52s)]
*  Fourteen million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, capping the cost of insulin at thirty [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=160.24s)]
*  five bucks. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=164.56s)]
*  And they also understand that we have a threat in Donald Trump, who every single day is talking [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=165.56s)]
*  about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, who's rooting for the economy to crash, who's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=170.8s)]
*  pledging to serve as a dictator on day one. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=174.56s)]
*  So people understand the stakes and they understand that we have a fighter in Joe Biden who's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  going to continue to deliver for them over the course of the next four years. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  We win. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=183.36s)]
*  I want to ask you about the threat that Donald Trump poses and certainly that messaging going [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=184.36s)]
*  forward. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=187.36s)]
*  But let me ask you, as you also mentioned right now, and as in the campaign statement [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=188.36s)]
*  that came out about the importance of black voters. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=191.8s)]
*  This was widely seen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=196.16s)]
*  This primary contest was widely seen as a test for Biden's strength among a critical [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=197.16s)]
*  voting bloc. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=201.56s)]
*  My colleague Gabe Gutierrez spoke to a young black voter from South Carolina. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=202.86s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=206.12s)]
*  Do you think that there is enough enthusiasm among young black voters such as yourself? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=208.72s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=213.88s)]
*  Like, just in all honesty, I think in 2020, like it was a very emotional time. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=215.88s)]
*  A lot of people were supporting, well, not supporting, but the Black Lives Matter movement [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=222.04s)]
*  had received great emphasis following the events that happened with George Floyd. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=226.8s)]
*  And a lot of emphasis was pushed to vote as people in a lot of entertainment outlets because [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=231.68s)]
*  everybody was at home. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=237.28s)]
*  So voting, voting, voting, voting, voting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=238.28s)]
*  Do you think a lot of people your age will stay home this election? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=240.64s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=244.72s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=246.52s)]
*  That is one vote. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=247.98s)]
*  Obviously, that is one person. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=248.98s)]
*  It's anecdotal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=250.92s)]
*  But I wanted to give you a chance to respond to that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=251.92s)]
*  How does the campaign plan to reach a voter like that who doesn't feel as motivated to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  add to the polls? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=256.8s)]
*  Yeah, this campaign knows we can't take any single voter for granted, particularly black [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=257.8s)]
*  voters who have been key to the Biden-Harris coalition and key to democratic victories [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  for years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=266.91999999999996s)]
*  And we're going to remind people of exactly what this administration has done on behalf [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  of black communities across the country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=272.64s)]
*  Again, record low black unemployment under this administration, black wealth growing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=274.56s)]
*  by 60 percent since before the pandemic, seven billion dollars in the HBCUs. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=279.72s)]
*  And we're going to communicate the contrast, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=284.36s)]
*  We're going to talk about Donald Trump, who when he was in president, we saw the damage [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=286.68s)]
*  he caused to black America. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=290.32s)]
*  The only things that went up under Donald Trump's presidency for black folks was the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  unemployment rate and the uninsured rate. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=295.12s)]
*  His tax cut, for example, gave double the benefit to the typical white household and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=297.06s)]
*  the typical black household. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=300.56s)]
*  He fumbled the bag on the COVID response, leaving black people disproportionately dead [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=302.04s)]
*  and leaving black businesses disproportionately shuttered. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=305.52s)]
*  So we're going to communicate what our vision is, what our accomplishments are. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=307.84s)]
*  And we're going to contrast that against the damage that Donald Trump has caused when he [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=310.52s)]
*  had power and the damage that he will cause if he's able to regain power. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=314.11999999999995s)]
*  How do we right now and certainly after tonight, how do we look at whether the campaign is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  shifting its attention to the general election or has that focus already shifted to that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=323.28s)]
*  inevitable rematch with Donald Trump? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we are absolutely focused on the general election against Donald Trump. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=331.28s)]
*  He's marching towards a Republican nomination. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=335.0s)]
*  We are focused on building an apparatus that can take him on and get to 270 electoral votes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  That's absolutely what we're focused on at this stage in the race. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=342.04s)]
*  What does that apparatus look like? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=345.64000000000004s)]
*  What does that messaging look like in order to defeat to defeat Donald Trump again? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=347.12s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like scaling up our operation in all of the battle around states, making [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  sure that we are fully funded with staffing on the ground. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=355.88s)]
*  It makes it's our paid advertising efforts. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=360.04s)]
*  It's our digital organizing efforts. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=362.24s)]
*  It's a 360 degree effort to communicate with the voters who are going to decide this election. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=363.68s)]
*  So certainly more to come and so stay tuned. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=369.2s)]
*  And let me ask you finally before I let you go, because you mentioned the battleground [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=371.96s)]
*  states obviously a lot of concern about the state of Michigan because of the of the protests [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=374.56s)]
*  that were taking place there over Thursday. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=379.92s)]
*  Are you at all concerned about states like Michigan and Arab American voters, Muslim [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=382.08s)]
*  American voters with the president's handling of the war in Gaza? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=386.16s)]
*  Yeah, we're certainly concerned about every state. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=391.64s)]
*  We're concerned about Michigan as well. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=393.76s)]
*  We are reminding folks, a, that the president is approaching the conflict as the commander [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=395.88s)]
*  in chief, not through the lens of politics, and that is going to continue to engage with [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=400.44s)]
*  the community from now through November and through the next four years when he is reelected. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=404.44s)]
*  People elected Joe Biden because he has the empathy, the decency and the seriousness of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAldXqOD6Q&t=410.15999999999997s)]
