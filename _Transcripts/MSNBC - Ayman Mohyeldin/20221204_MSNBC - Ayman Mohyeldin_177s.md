# Prosecutors Say Trump Sanctioned Tax Fraud In His Company
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [December 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM)
*  Donald Trump and his business empire are the subjects of no fewer than five major simultaneous [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=0.0s)]
*  investigations, a truly extraordinary challenge for anyone, let alone a former and possibly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=8.06s)]
*  future president of the United States. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=13.82s)]
*  Tonight, we're going to focus the New York state civil case, which centers around this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=15.8s)]
*  question. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=20.36s)]
*  Did Trump and his children lie to lenders and insurers about the Trump organization's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  financial condition? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=26.92s)]
*  Now, prosecutors just wrapped their closing argument saying that Trump himself sanctioned [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=28.72s)]
*  what became a sweeping 15-year scheme to compensate top executives off the books. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=33.04s)]
*  Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglas told jurors, quote, Donald Trump is explicitly [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=38.92s)]
*  sanctioning tax fraud. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=43.64s)]
*  This whole narrative that Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not real. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  In response, Trump's defense team requested a mistrial. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=49.8s)]
*  Attorney's lawyer Michael Van Der Veen complained about Steinglas' comments, saying, quote, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=53.8s)]
*  it's a bias that he put on the jury that can't be undone, and it's not insignificant that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=58.68s)]
*  he did it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=65.32s)]
*  Now, the judge in the case rebuffed that mistrial request. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=66.32s)]
*  The key witness, as you can imagine, in this trial has been longtime Trump organization [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=69.88s)]
*  CFO Allen Weisselberg, who's been charged with scheming to defraud, tax fraud, and falsifying [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=74.64s)]
*  records. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=81.08s)]
*  The jury was even hit with a grand larceny charge. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=82.08s)]
*  Prosecutors allege that Weisselberg used his position to get out of paying taxes on $1.7 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=84.6s)]
*  million in income. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=89.32s)]
*  As of now, Weisselberg is the only person to be charged. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=91.44s)]
*  He pled guilty to 15 felony charges back in August. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=94.96s)]
*  And the jury is expected to begin its deliberations this Monday. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=98.2s)]
*  And one of the final impressions from Trump's defense team, well, it was less than ideal. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=101.64s)]
*  Trump's team pulled an 11th hour evidence dump filing motions and new exhibits, leading [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=107.8s)]
*  the judge to scold them and refuse to accept any more motions from the attorney, saying, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=112.64s)]
*  quote, it's inconsiderate at a minimum. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=118.6s)]
*  At worst, it's a good old fashioned sandbagging. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=121.88s)]
*  Also this week, a federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's lawsuit aimed at derailing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=125.92s)]
*  the FBI's investigation of classified records stashed at his Mar-a-Lago home after he left [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=129.72s)]
*  office. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=134.4s)]
*  The loss is particularly embarrassing for Judge Eileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=135.52s)]
*  granted his request for a special master to oversee the case. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=140.0s)]
*  Cannon's controversial decision at the time was denounced by the appeals panel, arguing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  it was an unprecedented step to help Trump. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=148.56s)]
*  . [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRnYAZERQM&t=165.52s)]
