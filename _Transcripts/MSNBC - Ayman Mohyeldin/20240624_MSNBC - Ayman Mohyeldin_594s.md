# Rep. Ayanna Pressley On The Onslaught of Dark Money Facing Rep. Jamaal Bowman
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs)
*  This Tuesday, the most expensive primary race in U.S. history will be decided in New York's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=0.0s)]
*  16th congressional district. Political action groups funded heavily by Republican mega-donors [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=4.64s)]
*  are joining forces to unseat incumbent Democratic Representative Jamal Bowman. Only they're not [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=9.6s)]
*  backing a Republican candidate to do so. They are in fact backing a Democratic country county [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  executive named George Latimer. Why, you might ask? Well, this headline helps explain it simply. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=22.16s)]
*  AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, unleashes a record $14.5 million to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=28.64s)]
*  defeat a critic of Israel. Amazingly, as the Times points out, AIPAC's ad blitz almost never mentions [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=34.8s)]
*  Israel. Instead, the ads paint Congressman Bowman as a disloyal congressman to President Biden. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=41.36s)]
*  They also accuse Bowman of generating, quote, controversy, chaos, and conspiracy. In a statement [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=48.08s)]
*  to the Times, AIPAC called Latimer a progressive pro-Israel candidate and said Bowman refuses to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=53.6s)]
*  support Israel in what they call a, quote, just war. Now, why would a right-wing pro-Israel [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  political action committee spend so much money on a race but avoid mentioning Israel in their [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=67.2s)]
*  advertising if that's what they care about? Well, polling in the district shows that a plurality of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=74.08s)]
*  Democratic voters prefer a candidate that does in fact support a ceasefire, which is in fact [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=79.04s)]
*  Bowman's position. The poll also shows that 50% of Democratic voters believe the U.S. is giving [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=84.48s)]
*  too much aid to Israel and a plurality believe the U.S. is giving too little humanitarian relief to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=90.4s)]
*  the Palestinians. The irony here is that Bowman did not come to Congress focusing on support for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=96.64000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians or even criticism of Israel. In the past, he's voted in favor of Israel, such as [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  a bill for funding Israel's Iron Dome. But as Politico reported this week, it was a trip to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=107.6s)]
*  Israel, sponsored by the liberal Zionist organization J Street, that opened Bowman's eyes to the reality [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  of Israel's military occupation. It was a trip that Bowman called a transformational moment. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=119.28s)]
*  That evolution has now led to an unprecedented spending barrage by outside political groups and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  donors, some of whom are backers of Donald Trump, looking to make an example out of Bowman [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=131.04s)]
*  for simply criticizing Israel. It's also led former Trump opponent Hillary Clinton to join forces [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=137.2s)]
*  with many Trump donors by endorsing George Latimer's bid to unseat him. While we rightfully [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=143.28s)]
*  worry about the fate of our democracy, should Donald Trump win this fall's election, we also [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=149.6s)]
*  need to be clear about the sorry state of our democracy right now. What does it say about our [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=154.48s)]
*  political system when Republican mega donors, AIPAC, Hillary Clinton, and big crypto donors [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  can join forces and cobble together $15 million to oust a former middle school principal from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=166.56s)]
*  Congress for calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, a position that a plurality of his constituents [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=173.12s)]
*  actually agree with and want? Back with me again is Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, fellow squad [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=180.0s)]
*  member and supporter of Jamal Bowman's campaign. Congresswoman, thank you for sticking around for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=185.52s)]
*  us. So we are obviously, as I just said, concerned about the state of our democracy. Should Donald [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=189.84s)]
*  Trump win the election this fall? But what does this race tell us about the state of our democracy [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=194.48s)]
*  right now? I'm just so glad to be here in New York. I've been in the New York 16th all day today. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  I was in faith houses earlier today. I was at festivals. I was at small businesses. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=208.32s)]
*  And it was just, I'm very encouraged by the number of people that I met who understand what's at stake [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=213.04s)]
*  in this election in the New York 16th. They see Jamal Bowman for exactly who he is, and that is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=219.2s)]
*  someone who leads with love, who centers the people of the New York 16th, who recognizes that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=224.72s)]
*  our destinies are tied from Massachusetts to New York to Gaza to Haiti, who sees every child as his [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=229.44s)]
*  own and us as one human family, that our freedoms and our destinies are tied. They recognize his [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=236.56s)]
*  leadership as an educator, as an advocate, and as an effective legislator, someone who was valued [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=242.64s)]
*  this caucus, who's been endorsed from everyone from Hakeem Jeffries to Elizabeth Warren, and of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=249.44s)]
*  course myself and many others. But the endorsement that matters the most is that of the people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=255.04s)]
*  And I know that he has earned their trust and their confidence and their partnership because [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  he has proven. He is someone that I've worked with shoulder to shoulder on issues [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=266.4s)]
*  relative to trauma-informed schools, restorative justice, addressing the baby formula shortage, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=270.48s)]
*  and paid sick leave for rail workers. Jamal Bowman is pro-peace, pro-humanity, pro-justice. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=276.72s)]
*  And I'm grateful that he's my partner in good and my movement brother, and I'm doing everything [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  in my power to ensure that he is decisively returned to Congress in the same way that he [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=292.32s)]
*  was decisively elected the first time by a multi-generational, multiracial movement, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=296.72s)]
*  and delivered to Congress with a mandate by the people to do exactly what he has done. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=302.56s)]
*  In the Washington Post, Karen Atiyah wrote a piece titled, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  No One Should Be Surprised, A Black Politician is the Canary in Apex Coal Mine. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=311.36s)]
*  Inichi writes, Shut up or else is the message a pro-Israel lobby sending to black lawmakers [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=316.32s)]
*  in America who are critical of what is happening in Gaza. I just want to know from your experience, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  is that a message that you are getting about the war in Gaza? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=326.48s)]
*  I would say that Jamal Bowman, like many progressive, progressive black lawmakers before [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=329.68s)]
*  him, is a target because of the strong progressive stances that he has taken across the board. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=339.6s)]
*  He is a disruptor of the status quo because he wants us to advance solutions that go as far [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=345.12s)]
*  and as deep as the hurt. He has never forgotten the plot, and the plot is the people. He leads [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  with love. He centers the people. He is an effective legislator. He is a loving and dedicated [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=355.76s)]
*  husband and father. He is an effective advocate, and it was an incredible educator. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=362.0s)]
*  So again, this is the candidate who is pro-peace, humanity, and justice. I'm very heartened by [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  the energy and the response that I felt in the district today, and I'm going to continue to be [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=375.36s)]
*  out there on New York 16th making the case and reminding people of the good work that Jamal [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=379.76s)]
*  Bowman has done. And I just want to remind folks that just because we have titles, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=385.2s)]
*  it doesn't change our vulnerability. What do you do when your very existence is the resistance? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  You dig deep, and you put your head down, and you keep doing the work, and you don't lose sight of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  what matters most, and that is the people. That is exactly what Jamal Bowman has done. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=405.44s)]
*  He's our power. As you are very well aware, race has played a big role in this campaign. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=410.64s)]
*  George Latimer, regularly seen as using racial dog whistles, he said that Bowman has, quote, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=415.36s)]
*  an ethnic benefit over him. Latimer also accused Bowman of representing Dearborn, Michigan, a [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=420.32s)]
*  reference to a city with a large Arab and Muslim population. Are you worried that if a young black [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=425.68s)]
*  candidate like Bowman is ousted with this APEC money from Congress, that this can hurt Democrats [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=431.68s)]
*  in November with constituencies? They desperately need to win both Congress and the presidency come [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=437.36s)]
*  November in a state like Michigan. I'm worried about the impact of the absence of the voice of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=443.12s)]
*  Jamal Bowman and his effective leadership and advocacy and what that will mean. But I don't [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=453.12s)]
*  have time to worry because I need to work. What we have seen over and over again is that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=460.8s)]
*  organized people beats organized money. And the power of the people has always been greater than [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=466.8s)]
*  the people in power. Now, some people might think that's an odd statement coming from a member of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  Congress technically in a position of power. But I believe that Jamal Bowman is in the seat that he's [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=476.48s)]
*  in because he recognizes where the real power lies, and that is with the people. Yeah, and speaking [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  of the people, the slogan that he's been using, it's the many versus the money. There's a class [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=486.72s)]
*  element here. The majority of members of Congress are millionaires. Jamal Bowman was a middle school [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  principal before entering Congress. Is there room for working class politicians in American politics [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=496.0s)]
*  or even in the Democratic Party if people like Jamal Bowman are squeezed out by big money, by big [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=502.72s)]
*  dark money? Well, the electorate decisively sent Jamal Bowman to Congress, and I believe they will [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=508.08s)]
*  do it again with a mandate that we do need people that bring a diversity of perspective, opinion, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=514.96s)]
*  and thought, and lived experience, that the people closest to the pain should be the closest to the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=521.12s)]
*  power, driving and informing the policymaking. And as a black man in America, as a parent [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=525.68s)]
*  who worries and fights for his children, he has been closest to the pain, and that's exactly why [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=534.56s)]
*  we need him, because he brings that perspective, that understanding of the nuance, the complexity, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=542.16s)]
*  and the intersectionality of these issues and remains laser focused on advancing solutions that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=547.3599999999999s)]
*  go as broad and as deep as the hurt. Listen, at the end of the day, who you vote for determines [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=553.68s)]
*  who's elected, and who's elected determines the policies, and the policies determine every damn [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=558.0799999999999s)]
*  thing. Who lives, dies, who survives, who thrives. All right, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, always a [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=562.16s)]
*  pleasure. Thank you so much for your time. Greatly appreciate it, as always. Team Bowman, vote June 25th. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=568.56s)]
*  you [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTCR07sRKs&t=583.68s)]
