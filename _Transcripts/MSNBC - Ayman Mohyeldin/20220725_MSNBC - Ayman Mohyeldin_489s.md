# The Threat Future Doctors Face In A Post-Roe America
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [July 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM)
*  being overturned are greater than we ever could have imagined, because it's not just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=0.0s)]
*  what's happening in the moment, but also what's to come. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  In a new piece for MSNBC.com, Dr. Kafeeta Patel has a dire warning about the future [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=10.08s)]
*  of OB-GYN medical training. Dr. Patel writes, quote, almost half of the nation's OB-GYN [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=15.46s)]
*  residency programs are in states that have or will ban abortions, which will create crucial [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=21.72s)]
*  gaps in medical education. This in turn will make access to equitable, high-quality reproductive [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=26.76s)]
*  health care impossible or severely lacking for patients. Dr. Patel joins me now. Dr. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=32.32s)]
*  Patel, it's great to see you again. Thanks for joining us. Tell us more about your concerns. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=38.96s)]
*  It's not something I had heard before, but once I read your piece, I was of course thinking [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  like, yes, there is definitely going to be a ripple effect, not only in the practice [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=47.8s)]
*  of the care, but in the training and the medical education future doctors will receive. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=52.14s)]
*  Yeah, Aiman, and it goes beyond OB-GYNs. And that's part of the point I wanted to make. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=57.14s)]
*  So I'm an internal medicine physician, board certified and trained. I trained in emergency [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=63.02s)]
*  rooms. I trained in OB-GYN residency rotations alongside other OB-GYN surgeons, anesthetists [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  and other doctors to understand how to recognize many complications, everything from ectopic [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=75.38s)]
*  pregnancies to a failed pregnancy that might not have that a mother might want to carry [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=81.42s)]
*  to the full term, but was unable to, started bleeding at around week 19. These are all [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  things that present in a number of different settings, but all hinge on having that adequate [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=93.06s)]
*  training with 43% of training programs in states that won't even allow for faculty to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=97.62s)]
*  develop. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=103.78s)]
*  Aiman, think about this. If you don't have students, fellows, residents and faculty who [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=104.78s)]
*  understand how to teach and actually carry out these procedures or even instruct someone [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=109.42s)]
*  to carry out these procedures with confidence, it's not just lack of access to abortion, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  Aiman. It's everything from miscarriages to recognizing complications of assisted reproductive [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=119.42s)]
*  technology. Anything could be on the line. And that's exactly what's happening. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  Could medical training programs work around these bans? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=131.34s)]
*  So, yes, that's what there are. Of course, medicine, like many other areas, are highly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=135.54s)]
*  regulated and there are guidelines for residency programs, medical schools. That's a good thing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=141.06s)]
*  We have accredited standards and bodies which regulate all of these training programs. And [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=146.5s)]
*  they do, in fact, Aiman, require that there be some standards. But in these states, those [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=151.06s)]
*  standards are going to be severely restricted. States like Louisiana, which had one clinic [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=156.1s)]
*  that it could send its residents to, will probably have no options for an entire state. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=161.7s)]
*  And that is going to be reproduced across the country. So what will likely have to happen [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=166.33999999999997s)]
*  is that residency program directors will have to scramble and try to find virtual options. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=170.66s)]
*  Or Aiman, they might have to try to send students and residents, fellows and faculty out of state [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=174.66s)]
*  to states like where I practice now, the state of Maryland. But there are not enough slots. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=179.62s)]
*  And of course, this creates inequitable access because which types of residency [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=184.1s)]
*  programs and hospitals can send people out of state, ones with money, ones with access. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=188.34s)]
*  City hospitals, urban hospitals, public hospitals will be the last places that have the luxury of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=194.02s)]
*  sending people. So it's going to become an incredibly important issue. And it does not [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=198.58s)]
*  just affect women. It affects all families because reproductive care affects way beyond [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=202.82s)]
*  the person carrying a pregnancy. Even if the Supreme Court makes a move years from now to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=209.22s)]
*  allow abortion once again, do you think this will still be a problem for women? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=215.86s)]
*  It will. And all we have to do is look at my home state of Texas, where many of these restrictions [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=222.18s)]
*  have started for years now. It is very hard to find obstetricians and gynecologists who have some [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=227.06s)]
*  of the training in some of the procedures such as dilation and evacuation, some of these very basic [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  procedures that would be considered standard for any OBGYN or person training in these specialties [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=239.86s)]
*  to understand how to do. But because of so many severe restrictions, again, not just Texas, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=246.74s)]
*  but that's one example. There are very few doctors who actually have that training. And if you don't [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=252.18s)]
*  have training in it, you can't teach it. If you don't teach it, then you really hold back generations [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=257.38s)]
*  from understanding this. I'm not saying this to say it lightly. It reminds me of third world medicine. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=262.5s)]
*  When I would go to countries such as Mexico, Central and parts of Central America, India and Asia, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=268.5s)]
*  I would see the lack of this training. Fast forward, Eamon, just four to eight years, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=274.1s)]
*  because that's the cycle of a resident. Just fast forward that amount of time, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=279.06s)]
*  we'll have residents who have had none of this training and no option for that training in many [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=282.9s)]
*  of these states. It should make everyone pause because that's not what our country is built on. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=286.66s)]
*  Basic health care will be taken away in many of these places. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=291.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's an absolutely scary thought. Dr. Patel, I wanted to switch gears for a moment, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=296.09999999999997s)]
*  if I can, just before I let you go. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain spoke with my colleague, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=300.74s)]
*  Simone Sanders, about the Biden administration's preparations for monkeypox. Take a listen to this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=306.02s)]
*  We've been taking steps to ramp up the acquisition of the vaccine, to get the vaccine distributed in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=313.38s)]
*  this country. You're going to hear more announcements about this in the coming days, Simone. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=320.42s)]
*  We take this very seriously and we know that particularly for the communities that have been [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  most affected, they need us to get this vaccine where it needs to get to as quickly as possible. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  That's what we're working on. We want to try to contain the spread of monkeypox and try to make [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=335.54s)]
*  sure this does not become an endemic virus in the United States. Dr. Kavita Patel, your thoughts [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  on our preparations and our ability to combat monkeypox? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=351.14s)]
*  Well, Aiman, having just made a recent diagnosis in our community here in D.C. myself, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  I can tell you that I agree Ron Klain is on point with what they're trying to do, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=360.34s)]
*  but Aiman, it's not good enough. And I do think we're past the point where we're kind of trying [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=365.06s)]
*  to contain this and prevent it from becoming endemic. What he's really describing is that we [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=369.21999999999997s)]
*  want to prevent the community spread. The community spread is occurring. I do worry that we've [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=373.85999999999996s)]
*  unfortunately discriminated against gay, bisexual and transgender populations by trying to say [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=378.5s)]
*  that they are the only ones that are high risk. They're certainly amongst populations that are [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=386.58s)]
*  high risk, but we're missing community spread. We've had children with monkeypox diagnosed. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=390.82s)]
*  We have had people outside of what we would consider high risk populations diagnosed with [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=395.38s)]
*  monkeypox and that indicates Aiman, community spread has occurred. I think what would be great [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=399.86s)]
*  is that the administration could add to what they had just mentioned, what Ron Klain had just [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=404.26s)]
*  mentioned by literally simply putting out easy to understand graphics and information so that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=407.62s)]
*  people such as you or anybody you know could say, you know, this is an unusual rash. I don't feel [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=414.02s)]
*  so good. I do think I should just get checked out because that's what we're seeing. We're seeing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=419.14s)]
*  people present that said, I don't have any history of travel. I don't have any of the behaviors [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=424.18s)]
*  that people have warned that might be high risk, but I have an unusual rash and it's turning out [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=429.86s)]
*  to be positive. So good news though, Aiman, is that the majority of cases are self-limited, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=435.7s)]
*  don't progress to hospitalization, but the key is getting identified so that we can isolate patients [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=440.82s)]
*  so that they don't infect, unintentionally infect others. And I think that's where we need to [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=446.02s)]
*  concentrate our efforts on. We don't have enough vaccine for everyone. We're getting more, but if [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=450.58s)]
*  we could prevent people from not spreading it because they didn't even know they had it, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=455.7s)]
*  that would go a long way in containment as well. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYIx60sRiM&t=460.65999999999997s)]
