# Debunking the GOP’s misleading claims about President Biden
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [September 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc)
*  Kevin McCarthy's impeachment inquiry into President Biden is built on a slew of nothing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=0.0s)]
*  but misleading claims and flat-out lies with no clear evidence of wrongdoing on the president's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=8.84s)]
*  part. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=14.92s)]
*  And tonight, we actually want to set the record straight by debunking these claims one by [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=15.92s)]
*  one for you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=20.28s)]
*  Let's start with the Republican accusations against Biden for his alleged connection to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=21.68s)]
*  Well, this week, McCarthy claimed that quote, President Biden lied to the American people [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=24.92s)]
*  about his knowledge of his family's foreign business dealings. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=35.0s)]
*  Let's go back to 2020 to investigate that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  During a presidential debate, then candidate Biden said Hunter did not earn money from [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=42.0s)]
*  his businesses in China while he was serving as vice president. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=47.24s)]
*  And nearly three years later, we actually learned from Hunter Biden's court testimony [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=50.52s)]
*  that he had been paid in China. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=54.92s)]
*  But it is unclear whether Joe Biden was actually aware that was the case, because as the president [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=57.64s)]
*  said during his 2020 campaign, he and his son never discussed his overseas business [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=63.7s)]
*  dealings and Republicans haven't produced any evidence to the contrary. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=68.84s)]
*  In fact, here's Kevin McCarthy's next flimsy claim. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=72.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=78.52s)]
*  So this summer, Hunter Biden's former business associate Devin Archer told the House Oversight [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=95.52s)]
*  Committee that Biden put his father on speakerphone during business meetings about 20 times, but [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=100.08s)]
*  never to talk business. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  Quote, as he described it, it was all casual conversation, niceties, the weather, what's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  going on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=112.24s)]
*  There wasn't a single conversation about any of the business dealings that Hunter had. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=113.55999999999999s)]
*  Congressman Dan Goldman told reporters that after a closed door meeting. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  Again, there is no public evidence that the president ever participated in business dealings [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  with his son. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=128.76s)]
*  No one else has corroborated that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=129.76s)]
*  Then there's the claim that payments totaling $20 million were directed to Biden's family [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=131.64s)]
*  members and their associates through shell companies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=136.02s)]
*  And there is some truth to this claim as it pertains to Biden's family and associates [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=139.10000000000002s)]
*  of the Bidens. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  But again, there is no evidence, once again, that Joe Biden received any money for that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  Republicans also point to Hunter and his associates creating LLCs to accuse them of creating shell [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=150.5s)]
*  companies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=156.38s)]
*  But again, there's nothing inherently nefarious about simply creating LLCs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=157.74s)]
*  In fact, it is commonplace to create them when starting a new business. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=161.9s)]
*  Take a listen to Kevin McCarthy again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=166.5s)]
*  Hunter and James Biden, the president's younger brother, have reportedly racked up at least [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=184.22s)]
*  150 suspicious activity reports for their business transactions. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=188.86s)]
*  But emphasis here is on reports. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=193.82000000000002s)]
*  The sole existence of these reports is not hard evidence of wrongdoing, nor does it necessarily [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  trigger an investigation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  And Senate investigators in the Justice Department have reviewed these reports. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=203.46s)]
*  And again, no criminal charges have ever resulted. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=207.78000000000003s)]
*  Republicans have also said that as Vice President, Joe Biden allegedly engaged in a bribery scheme [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=212.18s)]
*  with a foreign national. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=216.4s)]
*  And this stems from a whistleblower allegation that the CEO of Burisma, which is that Ukrainian [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=217.73999999999998s)]
*  energy company on which Hunter served on the board, made two $5 million payments to the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=223.22s)]
*  Bidens. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=229.98s)]
*  Again, this claim was debunked by testimony from Hunter's former business associate, Devin [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=230.98s)]
*  Archer, who said that he was not aware of these payments. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=235.42s)]
*  And what's more, a Burisma executive said in 2019 that no one at the company had ever [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  been in contact with Joe Biden. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=245.1s)]
*  And finally, there is the claim that you've probably heard about the most, that Hunter [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=248.1s)]
*  Biden has somehow received special treatment from the Justice Department. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=252.22s)]
*  Well this week, Hunter was charged with two counts related to false statements he made [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=256.58s)]
*  in purchasing a gun and a third count of possessing a firearm while using a narcotic. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=260.54s)]
*  And these charges stem from a 2018 allegation that Hunter Biden lied about his drug use [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=266.2s)]
*  on those gun applications. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=271.74s)]
*  But as our friend Renato Mariotti explained in a column for Politico entitled Hunter [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=274.36s)]
*  Biden Got Exceptional Treatment, Especially Harsh, quote, until this week, I had never [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=278.56s)]
*  heard of a prosecution of anyone for possessing a firearm while addicted to a controlled substance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  Mariotti says, according to the data, federal prosecutors charged over 12,000 cases involving [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=292.52s)]
*  a firearm last year alone. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=297.6s)]
*  But the overwhelming majority of these cases involve the possession of a firearm by a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=299.98s)]
*  felon. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  And these cases are usually a way to get felons with violent histories or gang involvement [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=307.18s)]
*  off the streets, which sounds nothing like Joe Biden's son. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  So if you take away anything from this, let it be this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  Yes, Hunter Biden may have used his father's name and cash aid to pursue business deals [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=321.26s)]
*  overseas, which may be distasteful, but so far it is far from illegal. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=327.86s)]
*  And if you aren't a fan of Hunter Biden, I have some really good news for you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=333.18s)]
*  He's not running for president in 2024. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=337.54s)]
*  He does not serve in the government, nor does he serve at the White House. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=339.98s)]
*  Yet Republicans are trying to pin his actions on President Biden in a transparent attempt [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=343.46000000000004s)]
*  to distract from the very real criminal charges that the Republican front runner Donald Trump [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  is facing, including obstruction of an official proceeding and ultimately plotting to overthrow [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=353.85999999999996s)]
*  this government. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=360.26s)]
*  Rest assured, we on this show are not getting distracted. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yrpbxhzyJc&t=361.78s)]
