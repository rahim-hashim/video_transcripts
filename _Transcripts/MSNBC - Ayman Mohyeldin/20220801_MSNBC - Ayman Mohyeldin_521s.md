# Kansas To Vote On Protecting Abortion Rights
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo)
*  ABORTION WILL BE ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=0.0s)]
*  AND THIS TUESDAY, AUGUST 2ND, VOTERS WILL HEAD TO THE POLLS FOR PRIMARY RACES IN ARIZONA [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=5.5s)]

*  IN ARIZONA, THE REPUBLICAN GUBRANATORIAL FRONT-RUNNER, KERRY LAKE, HAS CALLED ABORTION THE QUOTE [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=13.16s)]
*  ULTIMATE SIN. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=17.72s)]
*  ARIZONA'S REPUBLICAN SENATE FRONT-RUNNER, BLAKE MASTERS, HAS PROMISED TO ONLY CONFIRM [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=19.56s)]
*  FEDERAL JUDGES, JUDICIAL NOMINES, RATHER, WHO'LL SAY ROWE WAS WRONGLY DECIDED. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=23.18s)]
*  BOTH, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, HAVE BEEN ENDORSED BY TRUMP. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=28.8s)]
*  IN MICHIGAN, THE TRUMP-BACKED GUBRANATORIAL CANDIDATE TUDOR DICKSON HAS CALLED FOR AN [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=31.68s)]
*  ABORTION BAN THAT INCLUDES BANNING IN CASES OF RAPE AND INCEST. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=35.6s)]
*  BUT ARGUABLY, THE MOST IMPACTFUL VOTE THIS TUESDAY ISN'T FOR A POLITICIAN, BUT RATHER [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=40.72s)]
*  A REFERENDUM, THE FIRST OF ITS KIND SINCE ROWE WAS OVERTURNED. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=46.02s)]
*  KANSAS WILL HOLD A VOTE ON AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALTER THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO SAY IT [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=49.72s)]
*  NO LONGER PROTECTS THE RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=54.7s)]
*  NBC'S DASHA BURNS FILED THIS REPORT EARLIER FROM KANSAS. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=57.68s)]
*  What's at stake here? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=63.2s)]
*  The right to choose. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=65.4s)]
*  This is absolutely an issue that if the restrictions are too high or if there's too much controversy [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=66.4s)]
*  that people's lives are at stake, not just the baby, but the mother as well. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=73.72s)]
*  I want to encourage everybody to vote for this amendment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=77.8s)]
*  If you have any pro-life feelings or thoughts that you might have on this stance, this is [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=80.6s)]
*  the time to do that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=87.24s)]
*  My next guest, Lafonza Butler, is the president of EMILY'S LIST, the political action committee [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=90.6s)]
*  dedicated to electing Democratic female candidates who support abortion rights. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=95.28s)]
*  She is now out with a new op-ed highlighting the connection between the GOP's efforts to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=99.24s)]
*  chip away at abortion access and limiting voting rights. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=103.88s)]
*  Butler writes, quote, When black women are disenfranchised, we lose our freedom to make [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  decisions on things that directly and disproportionately impact our lives and harm our communities [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=112.28s)]
*  like state abortion bans that are expected to harm nearly six million black women. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=118.64s)]
*  Lafonza Butler joins me now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=124.48s)]
*  Lafonza, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=126.16s)]
*  Let's start with that Kansas vote coming up on Tuesday. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=128.2s)]
*  If the state does end up removing the constitutional right to abortion access, what precedent [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=130.84s)]
*  will this set for other states to follow? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=136.72s)]
*  Well, thanks so much for for having me, Eamon. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=138.84s)]
*  Glad to be with you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  Look, Kansas is the first state where this and this question is going to be put before [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  the voters. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  We hope that Kansas voters are going to be able to see through the lies and trickery [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=148.36s)]
*  that Republican Party is putting forward. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=155.08s)]
*  And, you know, we know that this is going to be a hard fought battle. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=158.0s)]
*  What we believe to be true. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  And I think what was mentioned in your earlier segment, that poll after poll, the poll after [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=163.68s)]
*  poll after poll after the road decision has definitely indicated that Democrat, the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=168.04s)]
*  Democratic Party is the party that is standing with the majority of Americans. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  And we hope that the Kansas voters are actually able to make their way through this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=178.16s)]
*  morass of disinformation and misinformation and continue to represent their own sort of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  Kansas values. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  And for ballot measures to come, set the example that voters are going to push back [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=188.68s)]
*  against the attack on their freedoms. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  The freedoms to make decisions about their own bodies and their access to the ballot [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=197.96s)]
*  box. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=201.88s)]
*  Yeah. And I wanted to kind of ask you to talk a little bit more about that, about the piece [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  that you wrote and how you see the connection between abortion rights and voting rights. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=207.8s)]
*  Explain that to our audience. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=212.72s)]
*  It's a great question. You know, it made me really as I was drafting the piece, it made [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  me what I was really thinking about was the Texas. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  One of the interesting thing about Texas that I found that the first legislative [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=225.04s)]
*  language that was introduced, SB 1, was the restrictions on access to the ballot, which [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=231.64s)]
*  was then followed by SB 8. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=238.6s)]
*  You see that pattern in state after state, whether it states like Georgia or Oklahoma, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  Indiana or others, the connection between the Republican controlled legislatures all [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=246.16s)]
*  across the country are coupling these two issues, access to the ballot and freedom [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=252.24s)]
*  to make decisions about our own bodies. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=259.52s)]
*  And then you add in the attacks that are being directed towards the LGBTQ community. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=261.44s)]
*  You add in the lack of action that has been taking in Republican state legislatures on [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=267.16s)]
*  gun rights and gun control. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  And it is clear to me that this is a coordinated attack to maintain power, to control and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=275.52s)]
*  control over people's lives. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=282.16s)]
*  And it is it is intentional and it is deliberate. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=284.36s)]
*  And it is in this moment, this November, that we have the opportunity as Democrats to send [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=288.24s)]
*  a message loud and clear up and down the ballot and across the country that our lives are [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  our own. Our democracy is worth fighting for. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  And we are going to vote those out who vote, who stand in opposition to our will. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you about the Republican nominees for Senate and governor in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=309.36s)]
*  I'm not sure if you have noticed this, but those that track those races closely have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=314.16s)]
*  noticed that they have completely stopped talking about abortion on the campaign trail. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=318.72s)]
*  What does that say to you? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=324.44s)]
*  Is there an indicator that Republicans do not, at least in the state of Pennsylvania, do [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=326.0s)]
*  not want to be talking about this because they know it could animate the Democratic [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=331.0s)]
*  base? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=335.6s)]
*  That's that's clear to me, not only in Pennsylvania, but you look at the Republican [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=336.64s)]
*  Party across the country, they are either doubling down on their extremist point of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=341.08s)]
*  view or they are being really, really quiet about it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=345.48s)]
*  Leader Mitch McConnell made his point about the possibility of a national ban if Republicans [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=350.12s)]
*  are able to get control of the Senate and the House and then have not said much since. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=355.92s)]
*  But what voters have to look to is the actions that are also happening in states and state [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  legislatures all over the country. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=366.8s)]
*  While those candidates in Pennsylvania aren't talking about it, the Pennsylvania state [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=369.0s)]
*  legislature moved very quietly to do the exact same thing as is happening in Kansas, to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  rip away that right through the ballot in 2023, a time when less voters are going to be [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=380.92s)]
*  paying attention to what is to what is happening and what's going on in the ballot. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=388.0s)]
*  And so I would say to every voter, let's pay attention not just to the top of the ticket, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=393.92s)]
*  amen, but let's make sure that we are electing folks in state legislative seats, these [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=398.92s)]
*  bodies that are passing laws each and every day that will now govern access and access [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=403.96s)]
*  to abortion care and the freedom to women to make decisions about their own bodies. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=410.88s)]
*  Yeah. And speaking of all these other important races, I got to ask you before you go, the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=416.0s)]
*  Center for American Women and Politics, they put out a new study showing this midterm cycle [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  has seen new records for the number of women candidates in House, Senate and gubernatorial [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=426.24s)]
*  races. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=432.16s)]
*  The study also shows more women of color are running than ever before. You know, you're [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=433.44s)]
*  the head of one of the largest pro-women's rights groups in this country. How do you [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=437.92s)]
*  feel about that? Is that an important part of this struggle to make sure that the laws in [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  this country reflect half of the population? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=446.76s)]
*  Amen, you you said it. I you know, Emile's was created 37 years ago to be in a strong [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=450.84s)]
*  position in this moment. It is incredible that so many women are now seeing the value in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=458.44s)]
*  their own journey and putting themselves offering themselves as public servants to their [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=464.52s)]
*  communities. That is what Emile's List has always been about. And now we've got to continue to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=470.2s)]
*  make sure that we're doing the work to help them not just run, but to win. At Emile's List, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  we know that when women run and they win, they are a part of changing the world. And that's what [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=481.08s)]
*  we want to be about, making sure that families all over this country have the freedoms and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=487.0s)]
*  justice that they need and that this democracy it promises. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnL608MPOo&t=491.8s)]
