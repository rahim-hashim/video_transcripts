# Rashida Tlaib on the GOP’s efforts to rewrite Palestinian history
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [May 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI)
*  This Monday will mark the 75th anniversary of what Palestinians call the Nakba, or the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=0.0s)]
*  catastrophe, referring to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=8.2s)]
*  the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian towns and villages in 1948, when the state of Israel [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=12.76s)]
*  was created. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=17.92s)]
*  To mark this solemn occasion, Congressman Rashida Tlaib had planned to host an event [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=19.36s)]
*  at the Capitol aimed at uplifting the experiences of Palestinians who survived the Nakba and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=23.52s)]
*  to educate members of Congress and their staff about this important chapter in Palestinian [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=30.2s)]
*  history. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=35.92s)]
*  That, of course, was until Kevin McCarthy stepped in and blocked the event from happening, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=36.92s)]
*  accusing the Congresswoman of trafficking in, quote, anti-Semitic tropes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=41.16s)]
*  You see, Republicans are not only on a mission to rewrite and erase our own American history. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  It seems now they want to do the same with the history of people outside of the United [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=52.24s)]
*  States, like the Palestinians. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=57.04s)]
*  Never mind the fact that Israeli press has been reporting on the Nakba and what it means [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=59.32s)]
*  to Palestinians for decades, or that Israeli historians and scholars have documented it [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=63.84s)]
*  based on archival records and the eyewitness testimony of Palestinians who survived it, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=69.04s)]
*  or even that the United Nations will hold its first-ever commemoration to recognize [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=74.8s)]
*  the Nakba. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=79.28s)]
*  This is an acknowledgment of history. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=81.08s)]
*  It is unlike what Speaker McCarthy is trying to do. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=84.0s)]
*  McCarthy later tweeted that he would instead host a bipartisan discussion to honor the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=87.44s)]
*  75th anniversary of the U.S.-Israel relationship. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=91.44s)]
*  Tlaib responded by saying, Speaker McCarthy wants to rewrite history and erase the existence [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=95.44s)]
*  and truth of the Palestinian people, but he has failed to do so. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=100.6s)]
*  This important anniversary comes at a time of intense upheaval in the region. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=105.28s)]
*  Just hours ago, a U.S. official and an Israeli official told NBC News that Israel and the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=109.42s)]
*  Palestinian militants in Gaza have agreed to a ceasefire brokered by Egypt. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=114.3s)]
*  And it all comes after a week in which the Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=119.3s)]
*  30 Palestinians, six of them children, were killed, 90 more injured, from Israeli airstrikes [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=123.1s)]
*  launched on the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=130.04s)]
*  And all of this serves as a brutal reminder that yet another generation of Palestinians' [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=132.26s)]
*  existence remains under deadly threat, just as their ancestors did 75 years ago. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=136.98s)]
*  Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib joins me now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=143.94s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to have you on to talk about this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=146.14s)]
*  I know that Speaker McCarthy doesn't want to hear it, but it's an important conversation [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=149.82s)]
*  to be had. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=153.54s)]
*  Talk to me about why you wanted to have this event, why you wanted this day specifically [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  to be recognized and held in Congress. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=160.82s)]
*  As everyone knows, I am always very proud that I grew up in Detroit. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=165.26s)]
*  I always say it's the most beautiful blackest city in the country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=168.62s)]
*  And one of the things that I've learned early on as a child is that we can't really truly [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=171.82s)]
*  have equality and justice, or in this case, lasting peace, if we don't truly recognize [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=177.24s)]
*  even the horrific side of our own history and our own country with, again, our black [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=182.94s)]
*  neighbors as well as indigenous people that currently still, again, both continue to be [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=187.5s)]
*  targeted by the inequity and injustices. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=193.26s)]
*  And so for me as a Palestinian-American, growing up with two Palestinian immigrant parents [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=195.3s)]
*  talking about not only the Nakba 1948 and the experiences that they heard from their [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=200.98s)]
*  own parents, but also the fact that the Nakba never ended for many Palestinians still [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=206.42s)]
*  currently living again under what many, again, three organizations, human rights organization [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  called the apartheid. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=217.22s)]
*  And so for me, though, I wanted them to hear from, you know, folks that were in their 80s [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  came and spoke about being eight years old, another woman, 11 years old, living through [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=224.06s)]
*  the trauma and the pain of the Nakba. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=230.38s)]
*  The 11 year old woman in Tidal talked about carrying her 40 year old, was a 40 day old [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  sister in her hands while she was fleeing and how they watched, again, brutal attack [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=239.94s)]
*  on villages. Over 400 villages, Palestinian villages were erased during the Nakba. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=246.66s)]
*  And again, if we are going to be as a country, a true broker of peace, we have to recognize [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=252.06s)]
*  all the trauma and the pain in the history of the Palestinian people. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=257.26s)]
*  Talk to me about how the event ultimately went just from the fact that Kevin McCarthy [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=260.78s)]
*  blocked the initial one that was supposed to take place on the House side. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=266.34s)]
*  You got some help from Senator Bernie Sanders in moving the event to the Senate side where [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=269.98s)]
*  McCarthy has no authority to block it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=274.1s)]
*  Just walk us through how that played out and how did the event go? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=277.1s)]
*  I mean, it's typical. We expected McCarthy and some of the same folks that continue to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=282.22s)]
*  really block any access to democracy and have various voices, even those that are fighting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=287.54s)]
*  for reproductive health or those even trying to fight for justice within holding the Supreme [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=292.14000000000004s)]
*  Court accountable. We saw over and over again with Black Lives Matter, protesters show up [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  and kind of the aggression and kind of the silencing, intimidation and bullying that happens [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=302.26s)]
*  when we speak up and speak truth to power. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=307.38s)]
*  I think Leader McCarthy forgets before I was a congresswoman, I'm from Detroit and nothing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=309.86s)]
*  stops Detroit. And so I kept pushing and pushing until I could find a home for us to be right [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=315.06s)]
*  there in Capitol Hill like any other American deserves to be heard in the halls of Congress. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  And so everyone needs an uncle in the Senate. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=324.62s)]
*  And with this, you know, I think leading with compassion and understanding again to support a real [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=328.46s)]
*  democracy in our country, we all deserve to be able to share our stories and to be able to have [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=334.58s)]
*  space to do that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=339.82s)]
*  Every member of Congress has access to these rooms. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=341.18s)]
*  And I think Leader McCarthy doesn't believe someone like me deserves that same access. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  But we'll continue to push back against this kind of, I think, attack on our democracy and attack on [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  a whole people in the United States that deserve again to be heard in the United States Congress. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=355.29999999999995s)]
*  What do you make of him hosting this event, praising the U.S.-Israel relationship in lieu of what [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=359.9s)]
*  you had planned? I mean, the Israel-U.S. relationship has obviously come under a lot of scrutiny, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=366.26s)]
*  not just because of the Palestinian issue, but also because of what Israel is undergoing internally, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=371.29999999999995s)]
*  given its own challenges in the judiciary and with this extreme right wing government, the most [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  extreme in its history. But at a time when it is coming under that scrutiny and the U.S. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=381.62s)]
*  public sentiment is changing towards Israel, Kevin McCarthy seems to be doubling down on that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=385.66s)]
*  relationship. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=390.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you heard it even with his speech. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=392.02s)]
*  He's so much in line with the extremism right wing government under Netanyahu's leadership in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=394.18s)]
*  Israel and the way they're even talking about that, you know, both the United States and Israel's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=399.86s)]
*  birth under inequality. How is that possible when we're still currently fighting for that form of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=405.74s)]
*  justice within our own country here? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=410.7s)]
*  I mean, these are folks that are completely denying the existence of a whole people. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=413.06s)]
*  In the United States, I continue to talk about what's going on with our indigenous people who [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=417.5s)]
*  literally are under attack on environmental injustices from pipelines to indigenous women [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=421.82s)]
*  can disappearing every single day with no justice, with no accountability. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=428.34s)]
*  The dehumanization that happens continually under McCarthy's leadership is so mimic to what [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=433.86s)]
*  Netanyahu when he speaks of Palestinian people. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=440.3s)]
*  It's incredibly painful to hear someone say that they want another Necklat, that they don't want [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=443.26s)]
*  again to fully acknowledge the existence of its neighbors, the Palestinian people who have been [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=448.3s)]
*  their generations. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=453.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and we still hear that from Israeli officials who've talked about wiping villages off of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=454.14s)]
*  map, basically, in light of what has happened in recent months. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=459.06s)]
*  Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, thank you so much for your time. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=462.66s)]
*  I greatly appreciate you coming on to talk about this important subject. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=464.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eT4AsHcHJI&t=469.02s)]
