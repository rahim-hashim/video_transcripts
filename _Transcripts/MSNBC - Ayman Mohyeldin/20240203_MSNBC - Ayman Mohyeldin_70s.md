# NBC News projects President Biden wins South Carolina primary
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU)
*  It is official, and it probably has been for a couple minutes, but the checkmark means [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=0.0s)]
*  our decision desk has called the South Carolina Democratic primary for the incumbent president. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=3.72s)]
*  Joe Biden, NBC News is projecting that he will win the South Carolina Democratic primary. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=8.64s)]
*  You probably don't need me to tell you that with numbers like this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=13.98s)]
*  But again, about 6% in statewide. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=16.76s)]
*  You just see we will continue to get counties like this on the board. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=18.48s)]
*  I think at this point it's just a question of margin. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=22.96s)]
*  It's a question of what you can read into turnout, if you can read anything at all. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=25.94s)]
*  But the numbers tell the story, Eamon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=30.14s)]
*  Alright, thanks to Steve Kornacki for that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=37.94s)]
*  And as we just said there, Joe Biden, the president and the incumbent president, is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=40.22s)]
*  the projected winner of the Democratic primary in South Carolina. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=44.5s)]
*  Steve, we'll touch base with you in a little bit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMI11p4thQU&t=48.7s)]
