# 'I'm a little stunned': Ta-Nehisi Coates responds to sharp backlash to 'The Message'
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA)
*  Acclaimed author and political thinker Ta-Nehisi Coats has been on an unusually controversial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=0.0s)]
*  book tour, all due to some explosive conversation surrounding the subject matter of his latest [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=5.4s)]
*  book. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=10.44s)]
*  The message is a new collection of essays based on four of Coats' trips, including [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=11.44s)]
*  those to Senegal and South Carolina, as well as Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=15.24s)]
*  But there's been more, much more attention given to the latter part, those in Israel [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=21.34s)]
*  and the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=26.12s)]
*  It all started with this appearance on CBS This Morning, which was anything but standard [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=27.2s)]
*  morning talk. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards and the acclaim, took the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  cover off the book, the publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=40.72s)]
*  be out of place in the backpack of an extremist. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  So I think the question is central and key. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=48.64s)]
*  If Israel has a right to exist and if your answer is no, then I guess the question becomes, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=52.0s)]
*  why do the Palestinians have a right to, why do 20 different Muslim countries have a right [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=57.84s)]
*  to exist? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=62.32s)]
*  My answer is that no country in this world establishes its ability to exist through rights. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=63.32s)]
*  Countries establish their ability to exist through force. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=67.72s)]
*  This week, CBS News executive said this interview failed to meet the network's editorial standards, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=71.36s)]
*  but some journalists and media critics have actually come out in defense of it, calling [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=77.44s)]
*  the line of questioning just good journalism. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=81.12s)]
*  Even book reviews have taken a sharp turn. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=84.36s)]
*  Compact magazine published a review with the incendiary title Why Ta-Nehisi Coates Hates [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=92.72s)]
*  Helen Andrews writes in part, quote, The problem with Israel is that it shames him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=94.0s)]
*  How can it be that the Jews carved their Israel out of the desert and yet no place in Africa, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=98.68s)]
*  least of all Liberia, remotely resembles Wakanda? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=104.96s)]
*  Helen Andrews goes on to say Jewish people, quote, overcame the hostility of the world [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=108.96s)]
*  to succeed where Garvey and Co failed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=113.72s)]
*  That and not any resemblance to Jim Crow is the reason Coates hates Israel so bitterly. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=117.24s)]
*  We may now have to discuss all of this and more. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=123.36s)]
*  It's Ta-Nehisi Coates, author of The Message. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=125.32s)]
*  So I wanted to start with that because I know that you are trying to, I know, I know that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=128.04s)]
*  you are not seeing the reviews. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=138.4s)]
*  I know you're not. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=139.8s)]
*  You told me that you were not going to see the reviews or read what's going on about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=140.8s)]
*  this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  But this one cut through for me. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you about it because of the fact that in some ways it actually reinforces [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  a lot of what you wrote in your book. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=150.08s)]
*  But what is your reaction to that? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=153.0s)]
*  I mean, she didn't read the book because the book is about essentially it's a critique [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=155.56s)]
*  of nationalism at large. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  And it talks about Liberia, like, weirdly enough. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=164.36s)]
*  I mean, that is what it is. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=167.56s)]
*  I don't want to get into, you know, police and people's reviews. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  The thing that catches me is the carved part, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  Because that's exactly what I was talking about. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=175.08s)]
*  I mean, that is it is like people say this is not colonialism while speaking colonial [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=176.72s)]
*  language. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=182.68s)]
*  You know, I mean, like this notion that you carved yourself out of the desert as though [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=183.88s)]
*  once again, you know, the natural world was somehow empty. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=187.72s)]
*  There's no no one there to say nothing about this idea of use of force. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=189.88s)]
*  I mean, it is I'm sorry, I'm a little stunned. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=193.8s)]
*  I'm actually a little stunned. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=197.16s)]
*  Part of the reason I also chose that quote was because of the fact that in your book, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=198.64s)]
*  the message you talk about Zionism and part of the way Zionism understood historic Palestine [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  to be the letters that they were writing back or people were writing about what the towns [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=208.32s)]
*  and the cities that they were going to to colonize and to settle. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  You think of Zionism as a form of colonialism. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  Explain why you came to that conclusion in your book and your research. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=220.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, the first thing I do and this is, you know, always my process. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=224.72s)]
*  I read the documents from the time and the early forefathers of Zionism identified themselves [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=227.48s)]
*  as part of a colonial movement. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=233.68s)]
*  I mean, literally using the words colonized, Jabotinsky, Herzl. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, it's a common foundation, but it's not just that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  It is the mindset of colonialism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=245.6s)]
*  For instance, when Jabotinsky, you know, was a father of revisionist Zionism and very much [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=249.28s)]
*  the leader of the movement that Netanyahu is now considered. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=254.8s)]
*  He talks about the Native Americans in America. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=258.6s)]
*  That's his comparison for Palestine. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=260.56s)]
*  The notion, as Herzl puts it, that Israel will be a kind of a bulwark against savagery [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=264.44s)]
*  and a marker for the civilization of the West. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=271.12s)]
*  This is not language that is unique to Zionism and is unique to Israel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=273.76s)]
*  The problem is in the time of Herzl and in the time of Jabotinsky and their contemporaries, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=279.8s)]
*  colonialism wasn't seen as a bad thing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=285.64s)]
*  It didn't have the taint that it now has. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  And so they were proud to use the label of colonialism. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=289.8s)]
*  But now that it has a taint, you know, we have people who somehow I want to say that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=293.56s)]
*  words don't mean what they plainly mean. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=297.92s)]
*  You also talk about the fact that there's a through line between the three different [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  trips that you've gone to, to, you know, between Senegal to South Carolina and to Israel and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  the Occupy Palestinian Territories. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=310.0s)]
*  And that has a lot to do with the power of words and the way we are being taught education [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=311.8s)]
*  and the way these stories and these places are covered. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  What was that through line about education that resonates for you through all three? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=318.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, I'm sorry I'm still reacting to that review. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=323.48s)]
*  But really the through line for me is like the folly of ethno-nationalism. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it starts in Africa and trying to find some real sort of connection or understand [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=330.24s)]
*  what the real connection is between me and the people that I find myself there with and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=336.96s)]
*  grappling with that and trying to do it in a such a way that feels reality-based and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=342.24s)]
*  truth-based. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=347.08s)]
*  In South Carolina, it is obvious you are in a state whose foundation is ethno-nationalism [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=348.08s)]
*  that we're very, very familiar with, with the Confederacy and white Americans. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=355.6s)]
*  And you know, the chapter ends with me visiting the capital and everything. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=359.36s)]
*  And then obviously, finally, in Israel, a state that is segregated, not de facto, but [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=363.48s)]
*  de jure, that is ethno-nationalist in its very laws. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=370.28s)]
*  You have societies, I've said several times before, where Israeli Jews exist on one tier [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=375.28s)]
*  and everybody else is something less. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=381.04s)]
*  The notion that I would want to recreate that for black people is insane and contrary to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=384.3s)]
*  everything that the book has to say. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=390.02000000000004s)]
*  In fact, that's the nightmare for me. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=391.74s)]
*  That is actually the deepest fear. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=393.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=396.1s)]
*  That you interrogate a system and instead of coming to understand the system and its [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=397.1s)]
*  evils, you decided the real problem is that it's just being applied to you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=401.5s)]
*  Speaking of that ethno-nationalism that you're describing in Israel, the pushback would be [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=406.74s)]
*  And this is the argument that a lot of supporters of Israel say is that, put aside the West [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=411.3s)]
*  Bank for a moment. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=416.38s)]
*  Inside Israel, you've had Arab Supreme Court judges, you have Arabs that serve in the Israeli [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=417.38s)]
*  army, you have lawyers, you have doctors, you have engineers that are all Arabs, and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=423.06s)]
*  they use that and push that and say there is no discrimination against the Arab citizens [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=426.74s)]
*  or the Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=431.1s)]
*  What do you respond to that? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=433.82s)]
*  It's a lie. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=434.82s)]
*  I mean, it's like in the most literal... [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=435.82s)]
*  I mean, there was a Supreme Court judge. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=437.65999999999997s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=439.3s)]
*  The facts are not lies. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=440.3s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=441.3s)]
*  The notion of equality is a lie. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=442.3s)]
*  I mean, what's your... [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=443.3s)]
*  And let me be clear about what I'm saying here. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=444.3s)]
*  For instance, if you are an Israeli Jewish person and you fall in love with somebody [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=445.66s)]
*  that is a Jewish person in America or anybody else, frankly, you have the ability to make [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=449.94s)]
*  that person a citizen of Israel. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=454.62s)]
*  Far be it, you'd be an Israeli Jewish citizen living in Tel Aviv and fall in love with somebody [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=456.5s)]
*  that lives in the West Bank. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=460.42s)]
*  You will find it very, very hard, i.e. impossible, to have some sort of family with that person. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  If you want to move into certain communities within Israel, these communities have the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  right to discriminate. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=473.54s)]
*  I mean, it says it right there in the law on the basis of tradition and culture. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=474.54s)]
*  In America, we call that redlining, but it's perfectly legal in Israel. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=478.62s)]
*  Even in America, redlining was not legislated within the federal law and did not have court [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=482.7s)]
*  decisions behind it in the same way. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=487.1s)]
*  You can't say that because people have succeeded, even though you have a tiered system of citizenship, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=489.24s)]
*  that the system does not exist. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=499.18s)]
*  In other words, if I succeed in spite of segregation, that does not mean that there's no segregation. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=500.7s)]
*  If you break my leg and I still manage to win the race, you still broke my leg. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=506.58s)]
*  You definitely make similarities between the black struggle in America and the Palestinian [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=512.02s)]
*  struggle, and there are people who look at the black experience in America and say, actually, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  there is similarity between the black experience and Zionism. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=520.22s)]
*  There have been very prominent black supporters of the Zionist movement historically. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=524.54s)]
*  What do you make of that critique, and where do you see the relationship between, or solidarity [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=529.78s)]
*  between black Americans and the Palestinian struggle? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=533.62s)]
*  I mean, I think as a factual matter, it's actually correct. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=536.5s)]
*  And I think it's understandable. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=540.38s)]
*  I mean, I think it is natural for a group of people who are under oppression to look [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=541.38s)]
*  to an example of another group of people who have suffered centuries of oppression at the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  hands of the West, culminating with the terror and the disaster and the industrialized genocide [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=551.12s)]
*  of the Holocaust, and say, wow, it looks like on the basis of nationalism that these people [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=557.88s)]
*  have made themselves strong. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  Why can't we do the same thing? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=563.96s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a natural impulse. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=565.9200000000001s)]
*  But one of the messages of the message is that the job of the writer is to look deeper, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=569.1600000000001s)]
*  to look past that, to see, okay, what is the essence of that? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=573.72s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=577.26s)]
*  And for us, for me, my hope is, for my people, that the message is not merely that slavery [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=579.04s)]
*  is wrong because we are the slaves, but that it is an actual interrogation of systems and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=586.3s)]
*  a belief that those systems should not exist in the world, no matter who it is. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=591.9599999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you this finally, and we're almost out of time. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  A similar question that I asked you earlier this month when we talked at the Apollo about [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=597.5999999999999s)]
*  this presidential election. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=601.04s)]
*  And do you share a sense of optimism that if Vice President Kamala Harris wins, that [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=602.52s)]
*  there will be a fundamental change, as you have called for, in the way America approaches [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=610.5999999999999s)]
*  the Israeli-Palestinian issue, or is it going to be more of the same? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't have a sense of optimism. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=619.8s)]
*  I don't have that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=621.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  But I would not say I am optimistic. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=625.28s)]
*  One of the things I'm trying to get to, and, Ayman, honestly, I don't have this quite [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=628.64s)]
*  formulated yet, but I suspect that this is about much more than Kamala. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=631.12s)]
*  That doesn't mean Kamala is not responsible. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=635.52s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=638.9200000000001s)]
*  But I think we need to look a little deeper and ask ourselves, what are the forces that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  make this so hard and make this so difficult? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=644.48s)]
*  So I hope she does the right thing. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=649.4s)]
*  I think we need to push her to do the right thing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=651.24s)]
*  But optimism is not a thing I necessarily have. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  Ameen Khan, Haase Coates, thank you so much. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=657.8399999999999s)]
*  Congratulations on the book and continued success in all your endeavors. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=660.0s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Ayman. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=665.1999999999999s)]
*  Take care. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Had6L6O_KtA&t=666.1999999999999s)]
