# The cynical motivations behind Trump's church stunt
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg)
*  Look, the crime is most rampant right here and in African American communities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=0.0s)]
*  And more people see me and they say, sir, we want protection. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  We want police to protect us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=11.02s)]
*  We don't want to get robbed and mugged and beat up or killed because we want to walk [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=12.66s)]
*  across the street to buy a loaf of bread. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  But the black population wants law enforcement more than any other population. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=21.1s)]
*  Yes, Donald Trump actually said that yesterday in a black church in Detroit. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=27.540000000000003s)]
*  It was part of an effort to court black voters. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=32.1s)]
*  But most people who showed up to the event were actually not black. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=34.22s)]
*  That's probably why the ex-presidents depiction of black communities as dangerous and crime [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=38.82s)]
*  ridden prompted cheers from the audience. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=43.18s)]
*  Critics are now accusing Trump of filling a historically black church with white supporters [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=46.5s)]
*  and even staging the event to show a robust crowd. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=50.16s)]
*  This effort to court black voters with false claims of rampant crime rates is no surprise [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=53.98s)]
*  and not rooted in reality. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=58.62s)]
*  In fact, new FBI statistics point to a historic drop in crime in the first quarter of this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  year. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=65.97999999999999s)]
*  Community leaders are now calling out Trump just about how transparent his intentions [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  are. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=71.5s)]
*  In response to Trump's comments, Detroit pastor James Perkins said, quote, the reality is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=72.5s)]
*  he doesn't care. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  Every time Trump opens his mouth to talk to black folks, he demonizes us, insults us and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=77.9s)]
*  makes empty promises he'll never keep. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=83.22s)]
*  Amisha Cross and Eddie Glaude Jr. are back with me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=85.98s)]
*  Professor, I'll start with you and your response to Trump's whole approach to yesterday's event [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=89.02s)]
*  in Detroit, how he conducted himself, the points that he is making in an attempt to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=93.46s)]
*  do what he describes as connecting with black voters and appealing to black voters in these, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=98.38s)]
*  what I would argue, tropes, racist tropes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=105.44s)]
*  You know, what's so fascinating, Eamonn, is that, you know, you know he's gaslighting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=108.98s)]
*  us. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=113.02000000000001s)]
*  You know he really doesn't believe or care, believe in or care about black communities. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  But there was something strikingly familiar about his rhetoric. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  You know, there's this appeal to black communities for safety. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=123.86s)]
*  We saw it in the call for law and order in the 80s and 90s. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=127.86s)]
*  Out of the mouth of Eric Adams, the mayor of New York. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=132.62s)]
*  There's a sense in which this appeal to safety becomes the justification for draconian laws [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=137.92s)]
*  that have devastated our community. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=145.2s)]
*  James Forman Jr., a professor of law at Yale University, wrote a book in 2017 entitled [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=146.56s)]
*  Locking Up Our Own, where our desire for safety initially led us to embrace the war on drug [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=153.16s)]
*  policy, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  So what Trump is doing in a very clumsy way is trying to appeal to that very sensibility. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=162.04s)]
*  But he can't do it in an effective way because he doesn't really believe it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=168.44s)]
*  He doesn't really have any concern for the black community. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  So I want to critique Trump for what he's doing, but I also want us to understand the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=174.62s)]
*  nature of the appeal, because I hear the same thing coming out of Eric Adams' mouth. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=179.92s)]
*  Amisha, what do you think the strategy behind this event was? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=185.32s)]
*  Do you think whoever planned it thinks that it would work the same way that they thought [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump trying to sell sneakers or selling his mugshot on a t-shirt would appeal to black [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=193.52s)]
*  voters because he tries to project that they like that kind of stuff? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=200.96s)]
*  I don't think Trump's worried about this working. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=206.96s)]
*  Quite frankly, Donald Trump sees avenues where he doesn't need the black vote to even be [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=211.76s)]
*  competitive. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=216.96s)]
*  That being said, we're watching him pushing inside DEI. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=218.08s)]
*  We're watching him have these conversations where he's flying people in. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=220.56s)]
*  The overwhelming majority not being black is in all of his black events where white [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=223.96s)]
*  people are the predominant people there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=227.28s)]
*  But we're also watching him attack black people at every corner, whether it is agreeing with [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=230.96s)]
*  comments and stating himself negative things about HBCUs and HBCU graduates, wanting to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  reduce funding for black-owned small businesses, wanting to ensure that there are more and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  heavier crime tactics that resemble those that we fought against just a few years ago [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=245.4s)]
*  in terms of the use of excessive force. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=250.12s)]
*  This is not someone who stands by and wants to protect black people or wants to seek equity [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=252.28s)]
*  or access across our communities. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=256.76s)]
*  This is someone who is harmful to black policy and black agenda of uplift. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=258.6s)]
*  He's also doing all of these things, meanwhile, at the same time supporting Turning Point [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=262.8s)]
*  USA where he was today, where we have a vowed white supremacist, Nick Fuentes speaking, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  where you have people like Charlie Kirk, who leads that organization, who said that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=274.16s)]
*  black people have smaller brains, who's argued that black people don't need to fly planes [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=278.0s)]
*  because we will crash them, who has argued that we do not need to be doctors because [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=281.44s)]
*  if black people become doctors, people die. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=285.04s)]
*  This is a guy who is a known racist and who has propagated racism policy after policy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=287.48s)]
*  You cannot be that on one side and on the other, be a protector and a savior of black [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=292.72s)]
*  people at the same time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  It does not compute. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=297.72s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't care about black people. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=298.72s)]
*  the media in circles and he does that well. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=301.84s)]
*  Yeah, he certainly does. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  Let me play for you both and I'll get your take on the other side of it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=306.28s)]
*  This moment during Trump's remarks yesterday. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=312.32s)]
*  Your biggest threat are the illegals taking the jobs. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=313.32s)]
*  We have threats as to security too because again, so many of them come from prisons and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=316.76s)]
*  jails, from mental institutions and even insane asylums. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=322.88s)]
*  The first community and this is open knowledge that's being affected and affected very badly [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=326.92s)]
*  is the black community because they're taking your jobs. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  Professor, it's a classic divide and conquer. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=335.32s)]
*  What do you make of this apparent attempt to pit black supporters against immigrants? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=339.04s)]
*  I just burnt. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=346.8s)]
*  Well, I can't say what I really feel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=347.8s)]
*  It angers me, but it's an appeal to kind of nativist impulses within black community [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=351.08s)]
*  appeal to this idea that the country has failed to actually live up to its promise in relation [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  to black folk. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=364.12s)]
*  And now it's putting his thumb on the scale for immigrant population. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=365.12s)]
*  So it's actually an appeal to the ugly underbelly of communities. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=369.52s)]
*  And we have to understand that that may have some traction for some people. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=374.32s)]
*  But in the end, it reveals to my mind, the ugliness that drives Trump's campaigns. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=378.4s)]
*  He's always appealing to people's lower, lesser angels. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=385.4s)]
*  And in this case, he's doing it in black communities as we struggle with our own economic issues. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  So it's just his playbook and it's disgusting and it's a revelation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=395.28s)]
*  It reveals his character at its core. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  Let's certainly hope that we don't fall for it as a country come this election. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=402.52s)]
*  Eddie Glaude Jr., Amisha Cross, thank you to the both of you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=406.56s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your time. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpXVxava6dg&t=409.0s)]
