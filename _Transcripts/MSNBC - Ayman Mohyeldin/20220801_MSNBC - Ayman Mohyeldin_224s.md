# Midterms Become Battle Of Truth Vs. Conspiracy
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [August 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY)
*  One hundred days before the 2022 midterm elections, the difference between America's two major [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=0.0s)]
*  political parties and what they want for the future of this country couldn't be more stark. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=8.48s)]
*  This week, the former president and heir apparent to the Republican presidential nomination, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, teed off at his Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey for the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=18.2s)]
*  Live Golf Pro-Am event, kicking off the league's big tournament this weekend. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=23.14s)]
*  Now, the Live Tour is a new venture financed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=29.0s)]
*  It's all part of a campaign by the Saudi government to refresh the kingdom's image in the eyes [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=33.4s)]
*  of the world. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=39.0s)]
*  You see, they want you to think of your favorite golf players when you think of Saudi Arabian, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=40.0s)]
*  not their long list of human rights abuses, including the murder of the Washington Post [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=43.72s)]
*  Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Now, Trump took a hands-on role in that image rehab by hosting the event at his property, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  just miles away from ground zero. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=56.56s)]
*  And he had this to say in his defense. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9-11, unfortunately. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  They should have. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=66.16s)]
*  Now, family members of those who died on 9-11, well, they rejected Trump's version of history. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  To see a former president two days ago claim that he doesn't know about our outrage and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=76.92s)]
*  he doesn't know who was behind 9-11. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  That is the worst feeling that these family members can get when we're not even getting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=84.64s)]
*  through to a former president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=89.28s)]
*  That is the worst form of greed and worst form of evil. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=90.84s)]
*  All right, so the GOP's battle here is with truth and reality, and it extends far beyond [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=94.24s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=101.28s)]
*  As New York Times Magazine's Charles Homan notes, election lies and conspiracy theories, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=102.68s)]
*  they have become the central thrust of modern American conservatism. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=108.44s)]
*  Homan writes that the whole Trump-punched-in American democracy out of sheer self-interest [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=113.64s)]
*  had allowed his followers to glimpse a vision of the country restored to its divinely ordained [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=119.28s)]
*  promise that lay beyond that democracy, but also beyond him. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=124.68s)]
*  Just take the reelection campaign of Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers, who's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  facing an election-denying challenger in Tuesday's primary. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=135.4s)]
*  Now, you might remember Bowers from his January 6 committee testimony when he talked about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=138.56s)]
*  being the target of an extensive Trump-led pressure campaign. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=143.76s)]
*  This came after he refused to let the Arizona state legislator send fake electors to Congress. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, this week, NBC's Von Hilliard asked Bowers why, come Tuesday, he may lose reelection. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Probably because I stood up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=160.56s)]
*  And when they asked me to tell the truth, I told the truth. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=164.76s)]
*  And I did break a taboo. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=168.2s)]
*  And it's kind of a cultic thing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=169.2s)]
*  Know that you have to be in with the cult. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=171.76s)]
*  And Bowers is right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=176.12s)]
*  That's what the GOP has become. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=178.68s)]
*  It is a cult of conspiracy-pushing liars. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=180.36s)]
*  So with 100 days to go, voters across the country have a choice to make. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=184.32s)]
*  And it is not just as simple as Democrats versus Republicans. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=187.96s)]
*  No, November's election will be a choice between the truth and conspiracy and the future of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=191.8s)]
*  our democracy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3pZVIbEpY&t=197.96s)]
