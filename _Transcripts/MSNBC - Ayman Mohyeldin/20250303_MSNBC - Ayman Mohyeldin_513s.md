# Jeffrey Sachs on the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting and what comes next for Russia, Ukraine
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY)
*  The fallout from Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's blow-up at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=0.0s)]
*  the White House is still reverberating around the world. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=4.48s)]
*  After being unceremoniously run out of Washington by Trump on Friday, Zelensky is now being [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=7.28s)]
*  welcomed with open arms by the Europeans. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  You're looking at pictures of Zelensky being greeted in London today by UK Prime Minister [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=15.4s)]
*  Keir Starmer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=19.48s)]
*  This was part of an emergency summit with European leaders, all of them standing strongly [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=21.02s)]
*  behind Ukraine and pledging to shore up support after Zelensky's scolding in the Oval Office. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=25.44s)]
*  And following the meeting, Starmer made a pledge to Ukraine and a plea to Washington. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  Together with others, Europe must do the heavy listing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=42.96s)]
*  But to support peace in our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=48.48s)]
*  US backing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  So how did we get here? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=57.28s)]
*  What does this mean for America's position in the world? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=59.44s)]
*  Will an empowered Russia become more aggressive, as some might fear? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=62.4s)]
*  Will Europe be forced to step out of America's shadow and take a more forceful role in world [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=66.32s)]
*  affairs and defending the European continent? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=71.56s)]
*  The groundwork for Ukraine's unfolding catastrophe may have been seeded long ago. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=75.48s)]
*  Critics of American foreign policy have been warning for years, decades in fact, that NATO [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=85.92s)]
*  expansion would serve as an unnecessary provocation to Russia and that the most provocative potential [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=90.48s)]
*  addition to NATO, one that Russia would never allow on its border, was Ukraine. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=96.78s)]
*  One of those critics has been Professor Jeffrey Sachs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=103.0s)]
*  He has been warning Americans and Ukrainians that this day could come. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=105.48s)]
*  In fact, here's what he told the European Parliament just last month. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  I begged the Ukrainians and I had a track record with the Ukrainians. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=112.64s)]
*  I advised the Ukrainians, I'm not anti-Ukrainian, I'm pro-Ukrainian completely. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  I said save your lives, save your sovereignty, save your territory, be neutral. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=123.28s)]
*  Don't listen to the Americans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=129.6s)]
*  I repeated to them the famous adage of Henry Kissinger, that to be an enemy of the United [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=132.08s)]
*  States is dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=138.28s)]
*  Well, here we are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=143.4s)]
*  And with us now is the man you just heard from, Professor Jeffrey Sachs. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=145.24s)]
*  He's an economist and the director of the Center for Sustainable Development in the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=148.0s)]
*  Earth Institute at Columbia University. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=152.16s)]
*  Professor Sachs, it's great to have you on the show. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=154.68s)]
*  Thank you for making time for us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=156.88s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=158.28s)]
*  I thought I'd start, you know, after all of your warnings over the years, and I follow [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=159.6s)]
*  your work closely and certainly your public comments closely, I was curious to hear what [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=163.04s)]
*  your take on what we witnessed in the Oval Office on Friday and how you interpret what [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=167.08s)]
*  happened on Friday. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=172.64s)]
*  We're in the endgame, Eamon, of a 30-year attempt by the United States to move the U.S. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=173.96s)]
*  military and the NATO alliance into the Black Sea region, specifically to Ukraine and to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  Georgia. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  This idea goes back to 1994, when it was basically decided within the Clinton administration. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  It was laid out in detail by Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1997 in his book The Grand Chessboard. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  I've been watching this year by year for these 30 years. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=207.92s)]
*  And I believe that it would come to grief, and it's coming to grief. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=214.08s)]
*  Ukraine has lost perhaps a million people to death and a serious injury in a war that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=217.6s)]
*  never should have taken place. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=226.28s)]
*  This is like China or Russia trying to establish a naval base or a military base in Canada [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=229.12s)]
*  or in Mexico. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=236.76s)]
*  You could imagine such a scenario, but the United States would not take kindly to it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=238.32s)]
*  Russia told the United States for 30 years, don't come to our borders with your military [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=244.64s)]
*  alliance. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=250.6s)]
*  The U.S. thought it had all the cards. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=251.92s)]
*  The U.S. and I've gone through this with Americans again for 30 years, saying you've exaggerated [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=254.6s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=262.4s)]
*  So what do I make of what happened last week? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=263.4s)]
*  I believe that Trump does not want to hold the losing hand that Biden was playing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=266.64000000000004s)]
*  Biden thought in 2021, we have all the cards. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  We can push NATO to Ukraine. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=274.36s)]
*  Russia can't really resist. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  That's been the American attitude for decades, literally. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  They thought economic sanctions or our weapons systems, the HIMARS and the ATTAKMS, or unrest [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  inside Russia would mean that the U.S. would get its way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=291.84s)]
*  It was absolutely obvious that this was wrong. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=296.52s)]
*  Going back to 2021, I tried to tell Jake Sullivan, I told the White House, I tried to say to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  everybody, you're making a terrible mistake. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, in the end, Trump doesn't want to play a losing hand. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  So he's cutting his losses. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  He's saying we're not going to back a war that's going south, that is losing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=314.12s)]
*  And that's basically the end of it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  As somebody who tracks this very closely and who's been studying it for decades, are you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=322.8s)]
*  concerned that instead of being an honest broker between Russia and Ukraine, a Trump-led [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=326.12s)]
*  United States is simply siding with Russia at Ukraine's expense, as you said, to avoid [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=332.44s)]
*  this kind of losing hand, and that this could be more devastating for Ukraine down the road [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  and perhaps other countries in Europe? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  What some in this country argue is that if Ukraine falls, or somehow its territory is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  lost to Russia, it will only embolden Vladimir Putin and the Russians to say they can do [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  this again during a Trump presidency. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=357.64s)]
*  When I was 14 years old, General Westmoreland said it's the domino effect. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=361.56s)]
*  If Vietnam falls, all of Southeast Asia will go communist. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  This is a meme of American foreign policy for decades. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=372.64s)]
*  No, I'm not concerned about that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=377.36s)]
*  What I would say absolutely that Americans should understand, in March 2022, a peace agreement [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  was on the table that would have ended this conflict. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=388.64s)]
*  You can look up, because The New York Times kindly provided us with the text of the April [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  15 document, which was nearly ready for signing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=397.64s)]
*  The United States and the UK told the Ukrainians, don't sign, don't accept neutrality, fight [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  on. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=409.12s)]
*  This was the terrible mistake. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=410.36s)]
*  I knew it then. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=413.36s)]
*  I told them then. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=414.36s)]
*  But they did it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  I actually flew to Turkey to hear the details of how Ukraine walked away from the negotiating [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  table. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  From that moment, when a decent agreement was on the table, until today, Ukraine, as [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=424.32s)]
*  I said, has had about a million casualties. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=428.72s)]
*  We need to stop these wars, because this is absolutely leading us nowhere good, only bad. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  I spoke at University of Pennsylvania a couple of days ago, and Penn was founded by Benjamin [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  He wrote in a letter in 1783 to a friend, and I'm paraphrasing, there's no such thing [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  as a good war, and there's no such thing as a bad peace. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=457.64s)]
*  This is basically right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=461.84s)]
*  This war has been a bad war, and we need peace to save Ukraine. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=463.56s)]
*  This is the point, to save Ukraine, not to use Ukraine for our purposes, not to use Ukraine [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  to weaken Russia or to use Ukraine for strategic minerals, for heaven's sake, but to let Ukraine [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=475.0s)]
*  be sovereign and stable with neutrality, which is, if you look on the map, what is the natural [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=482.0s)]
*  thing for Ukraine to be? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHAZmBD5cY&t=491.72s)]
