# Dearborn mayor ramps up police after 'bigoted' WSJ op-ed
**MSNBC - Ayman Mohyeldin:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg)
*  Dearborn, Michigan, is home to the largest Muslim population per capita in the nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=0.0s)]
*  It is a city that has been particularly touched by the Israel-Hamas war and the subsequent [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=5.22s)]
*  humanitarian crisis inside Gaza, as many community members have family ties and personal connections [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=9.86s)]
*  to the region. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=16.04s)]
*  But now the mayor of Dearborn, Abdullah Hamoud, is ramping up police forces in places of worship [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=17.04s)]
*  and major city infrastructure, after a scathing Wall Street Journal op-ed was published on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=22.46s)]
*  Friday titled, Welcome to Dearborn, America's Jihad Capital. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=27.44s)]
*  The mayor says the article has already led to an alarming increase in bigoted and Islamophobic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=32.52s)]
*  rhetoric online targeting the city. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  The piece has received widespread criticism over the last two days, including from Michigan [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=40.04s)]
*  state Senator Majority Whip Mallory McMorrow, who called it, quote, not only irresponsible, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=43.96s)]
*  but downright dangerous. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  And that's because grossly mischaracterizing imams, politicians, pro-Palestinian protesters [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=51.08s)]
*  who live in the city, and it conflates them with organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=57.08s)]
*  and a country like Iran. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  But it makes no mention of the more than 27,000 people, many women and children, killed inside [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=64.32s)]
*  Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, as the reason the millions of people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=70.88s)]
*  across the country and the world are protesting. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=75.28s)]
*  And it comes at a time when we're seeing rising anti-Arab, American and anti-Muslim sentiments [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=78.36s)]
*  throughout the country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=83.52s)]
*  Let's not forget, back in October, a six-year-old Palestinian boy, Wadir al-Fayyum, was stabbed [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  to death by his landlord in an alleged anti-Muslim hate crime. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  In November, a former Obama official was arrested after he was recorded taunting a New York [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=95.64s)]
*  City food vendor with Islamophobic insults. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=100.2s)]
*  He has since reached a plea deal on hate crime charges. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=103.2s)]
*  In November, a man was arrested after shooting three Palestinian students in Vermont simply [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=106.16s)]
*  because they were speaking Arabic with a mix of English. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=110.64s)]
*  Two were wearing keffayas, a traditional Arab headdress. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=113.36s)]
*  One of the students, Hisham Awartani, was left paralyzed from the chest down. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=116.8s)]
*  Local and federal authorities are still investigating the motive in that crime. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  But it goes without saying, then, that the kind of rhetoric we see in The Wall Street [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=126.16s)]
*  Journal leads to real-life threatening consequences that President Biden has acknowledged is a [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  in a post on X, saying in part, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  Notice the post makes no mention of the op-ed in question. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=155.72000000000003s)]
*  The president's support among Arab Americans has taken a drastic turn recently, falling [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  to a whopping 17% down from 59% in 2020. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=164.36s)]
*  His numbers are also dropping in Michigan, where recent polls have placed Donald Trump [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=169.36s)]
*  in the lead. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  In this past week, President Biden may have been hoping to turn things around with a visit [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  to this state. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=178.12s)]
*  Instead, a tense scene unfolded at UAE event in Warren, when a group of pro-Palestinian [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=179.12s)]
*  protesters tried to confront him over his administration's support for Israel's ongoing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=184.56s)]
*  war in Gaza. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  Biden campaign had planned to meet with several Arab American leaders while in Michigan, but [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=191.4s)]
*  several of them, including Dearborn's mayor, Abdullah Hamoud, declined that invitation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=195.44s)]
*  Mayor Hamoud joins us now to discuss this and more. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=200.8s)]
*  Mayor Hamoud, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=204.12s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you on the show. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=205.96s)]
*  I'll start with The Wall Street Journal op-ed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=207.44s)]
*  You've called it racist, bigoted and Islamophobic, and I listed out just a few examples of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=210.72s)]
*  ramifications a piece like this can lead to in our country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=216.56s)]
*  But talk to us through what you're hearing on the ground from your constituents, how [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=221.72s)]
*  it's landing in the community, and what made you make the decision to increase the police [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=225.36s)]
*  presence at around community centers, places of worship and elsewhere. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=230.06s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=234.32s)]
*  That piece was extremely inflammatory. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=238.68s)]
*  being published, we received many a calls from faith leaders across the community who [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=241.32s)]
*  no longer felt safe, including residents and members of the congregation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  And so working with our police chief, we upped the patrols, especially around places of worship, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=250.12s)]
*  to ensure people not only knew that they were safe, but also felt safe. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=254.4s)]
*  And what we found online, though, was just an alarming rate of Islamophobic and anti-Arab [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=257.92s)]
*  rhetoric that was just spewed all over various social media forms. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=261.96s)]
*  Language such as, you know, oh, Dearborn might be a great place until I show up with my AK-47. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=267.52s)]
*  That type of language is unacceptable and it's something that we want to ensure to our residents [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=272.08s)]
*  that we're doing all that we can to ensure their safety. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  Can you describe for us, I mean, some of the conversations that you've had with your constituents [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  since the war began generally? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, how have members of your community talked about the grief and the pain of what [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=284.44s)]
*  they are experiencing as Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, or residents in your community [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=289.28s)]
*  with close ties to Gaza and what is happening there? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=295.4s)]
*  You know, for many, they're reliving the trauma. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  We are home to a large Lebanese community, Palestinian community, Iraqi community, Syrian [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=302.44s)]
*  and Yemeni communities. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=307.0s)]
*  And for them, many are immigrant refugees themselves. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=308.44s)]
*  And so they bear the scars and the first-hand accounts of what it was like to live under [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=310.52s)]
*  our occupation, under apartheid, under bombardment. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=315.24s)]
*  And watching all the scenes unfold, you know, the genocide being live streamed, it's as if [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=318.92s)]
*  they were living that experience all over again. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=323.48s)]
*  And when you have residents coming to your council meetings, when we passed a ceasefire [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  resolution talking about losing 80 loved ones, you know, what words can you offer? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=328.76s)]
*  Condolences are surely not enough. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=333.32s)]
*  But this is a time in which our Dearborn community comes together, Arab and non-Arab alike, Muslim [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=335.88s)]
*  and non-Muslim alike, and try to be there in this really difficult moment. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=340.36s)]
*  Last night on this program, I talked to Michael Tyler, Communications Director for the Biden [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=343.8s)]
*  Campaign. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=348.6s)]
*  Let's take a quick listen to what he told me after I asked him about the support of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=349.88000000000005s)]
*  Arab American and Muslim voters in a swing state and an important state like Michigan. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=354.12s)]
*  We're certainly concerned about every state. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=360.6s)]
*  We're concerned about Michigan as well. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  We are reminding folks, A, that the president is approaching the conflict as the commander [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=364.04s)]
*  in chief, not through the lens of politics, and that he's going to continue to engage [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=368.76000000000005s)]
*  with the community from now through November and through the next four years when he is [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  re-elected. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=377.16s)]
*  People have elected Joe Biden because he has the empathy, the decency and the seriousness [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=378.12s)]
*  of purpose to serve as commander in chief and to serve as president. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  And we believe that that stands in stark contrast to people like Donald Trump, who's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=385.96s)]
*  running a campaign of revenge, of retribution, of harm because he cares about himself and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=390.44s)]
*  certainly has no business stepping back into the Oval Office. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=394.68s)]
*  So we will engage with the community and we will continue to present our vision in contrast [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=397.32s)]
*  that with our opponent in Donald Trump. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=401.88s)]
*  There's two things that stood out to me in that one is the words empathy and decency, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=404.12s)]
*  because I think some of the criticism has been that this administration has not shown [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=407.8s)]
*  enough empathy and decency to constituents like yours in Dearborn or other Palestinian, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=411.24s)]
*  Arab, Muslim Americans. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=416.6s)]
*  And two, the part of contrasting with Trump as being one of revenge and retribution. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=418.12s)]
*  I thought I just would pose that to you and get your reaction to how that message matches [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  with Biden's actions when it comes to the Israel-Hamas war so far. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=429.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, the residents in Dearborn actually feel betrayed by current President Biden because [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=433.56s)]
*  he had promised decency and he promised to lead with humanity in the White House. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=437.48s)]
*  And what we have found since the events of October 7th are anything but. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=441.32s)]
*  Residents feel ignored and each time a spokesperson steps to the podium at a various press conference [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=445.72s)]
*  representing some State Department, we see that lack of empathy being spewed from the podium. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=450.76s)]
*  When you're questioning the number of Palestinian lives that ever have that have actually been lost. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=456.92s)]
*  When you express that the only thing that can be promised is more civilian casualties and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=460.6s)]
*  reluctantly only speaking to Palestinian lives only in reference as civilian casualties. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=466.28s)]
*  You know, for us, when you have an opportunity to engage the community, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=470.76s)]
*  because I heard the spokesperson use the word engage, there are several forms of engagement. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, to only send a campaign manager as the first form of engagement as your delegation [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=477.56s)]
*  to the city of Dearborn to speak with the Arab community or the Muslim community [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  is a complete slap in the face. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=485.64s)]
*  For us, this isn't a moment for electoral politics. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=487.24s)]
*  This is a moment for us to put humanity at the forefront, to talk about the context of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=489.4s)]
*  Palestinians outside the context of just poll numbers. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=494.2s)]
*  You know, we look forward to having serious dialogue with decision makers and policy makers [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=497.56s)]
*  about how to change course, because if you want to draw contrast with Donald Trump, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  you have to talk about what makes you different as it pertains to our family members and our [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  friends overseas. We're currently dying each and every single day. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=509.88s)]
*  Over 80% of Gaza has been decimated. 100% of the people have been displaced. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  And over 50% of all those who have been killed are children. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=518.36s)]
*  So talk to us about what changes tomorrow. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  If you had a chance to speak to President Biden directly, what would you say to him? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=523.72s)]
*  I think immediately I would say that is always time to do the right thing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=528.84s)]
*  And the right thing in this moment of time calls for a ceasefire unequivocally. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=533.88s)]
*  That is what is needed. We talked about also putting back forth the funding for Anderwa, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=539.08s)]
*  which is helping assure that 2.2 million people don't die of famine. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=544.12s)]
*  This is just some of the talking points, but to implore the president as somebody who promised [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=549.64s)]
*  us decency and humanity in the White House, to search his soul, to listen to the, to heed [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  the concerns of Americans, not just Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, but Americans from coast to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  coast about ushering diplomatic efforts and moving us forward as a nation. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=564.5999999999999s)]
*  As you've probably heard, and certainly there have been these voices out there critical of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=569.2399999999999s)]
*  how Arab Americans or Muslim Americans might vote. And they say if Donald Trump does in fact [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=574.76s)]
*  be Joe Biden in a state like Michigan, that Arabs and Muslims would be blamed for that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=580.12s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to respond to that criticism. I know that you were saying it's not [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=585.88s)]
*  right to look at things through electoral politics, but the electoral conversation, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=590.12s)]
*  the political conversation is happening as a tool against the community right now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=594.92s)]
*  You know, I've never lived in a world where you point at the voters and blame them if the candidate [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=599.88s)]
*  does not win. The candidate needs to self-reflect and look in the mirror, in this case, be it [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=607.16s)]
*  President Biden. The question has to fall squarely on him. What will he do to demonstrate, to rebuild [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=611.16s)]
*  that trust and respect amongst Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, and Democrats across the base, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=616.5999999999999s)]
*  over 80% who support a ceasefire? What will he do to prevent the unraveling of our American [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=622.04s)]
*  democracy, which is the threat that Donald Trump poses? So those questions need to be put back onto [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=627.0s)]
*  the candidate and no blame should ever be put on a voter or a constituent. We want to go to the polls [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=631.96s)]
*  with hope, inspired, in support of a candidate. This idea that you draw people to the ballot box [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=637.72s)]
*  by getting them to say, I am the lesser of two evils or out of fear of who might assume the office, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=644.2s)]
*  that's not as inspirational as one of hope. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=649.96s)]
*  All right, Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hamoud, sir, thank you so much for your time and your insights. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=652.84s)]
*  I greatly appreciate you joining us tonight. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTe9se_2KJg&t=656.36s)]
